Feminists criticise Polizeiverhalten race and after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. was killed.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot", while they were waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed Teenagers www.dowwolffcellulosics.com blogger Miriam Zoila Perez, a change in the Onlinediskussionen white feminists.
After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race, when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and income.
While the tensions in the Midwest and across the country, however, increased attention was given to Perez that the responses of white women to 100% of the german.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots came from the 9th of August the personal essays with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez was an important change.
"I do not believe that many people in the feminism, which is about the white and privileges and kind of talk about it", she said.
The people felt forced to express something about the incidents.
It's a characteristic feature of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson so ethnisiert is that they need to express.
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought the problems to light, those black Amerikanerinnen are exposed to every day, but not as a "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can be a bit funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 likes from everywhere", said Mitchell.
If I was a little bit about poste, as people in their own country are under siege, the silence is deafening.
"how can it be safe for women, to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public space?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, the race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between Rassen- and Geschlechterproblemen.
For they have not had the luxury of black women, the issues of clean to separate; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women are now the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen Banquetting, says Angela Hattery, professor of women and at the George Mason University, that their predecessors did the opposite.
"between 1865 and Waldfeuer at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman", said Hattery.
White women in history have had to be involved, in order to justify the Lynchmord.
For Hattery came the split between white and black women to the point where white female fighters for the suffrage as Susan B. Anthony, the country in the late years of the 19th century analysed and stated that the fight for the right to vote only for a group could be successful: women or black people.
"they made the decision to use for suffrage, and the right to vote for black people should come later", said Hattery.
If you look at such things, one with power, will be aware of why 5-color women white women do not trust.
We have our job not well done.
We have never helped black women, their husbands and sons to protect.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised.
The group was founded almost 40 years after the original plea for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell is the flood of white feminist responses to the questions that have been raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists "catch" with the problems with black women, which has been set apart for generations.
"wouldn't it be great if the activists, the more than such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child so seriously nähmen as it with the right to Empfängniskontrolle do?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, their career on the fight for reproductive rights and their access to contraceptive methods, are now seeking to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointierten article by Rebecca Carroll, Kolumnistin of the Guardian in which they more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who had a different, but parallel reason have an inherent risk of the body to understand - and opinions on race, in the public opinion polls are clearly very different - the changes to be", Steinem wrote.
Even though Steinem for a rather intersektionalen feminism is, as well as in the Rassen- Car-jackings Geschlechterthemen, are some of their comments on race in America but is truly amazing.
Christina summer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" said to She The People, that young men in the United States, in particular, young men, "5-color far are more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinems to Ferguson's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's' auflegte verletzlichen, to young black and Hispanic men, to help it was infuriating reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus constraineth.
After the almost 76,000 US-Grenzpolizei CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o unaccompanied minors in the country this year, has taken on the issue of immigration is also returned to the surface - this time as an issue.
Andrea Islacom Co-Vorsitzende of We Belong Together, an organisation which women mobilised for the immigration, said that for a reassessment of the issue as a major issue, it merely needs to publish the stories of Einwandererfrauen.
"these speak for themselves", said Mercado.
If the vast majority of Arbeitsvisa to male immigrants, are the women that accompany it, in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"these stories will find a finish in the women's organisations", she said.
