An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J".
You, so you could zerflossen best describe it, it's like a cardboard-I, slowly on the one in the rain has let stand.
Occasionally, he said, a woman he is said to be too serious, intense, exhausting, and maybe something from kratzbürstig.
And then shook him by the hand.
Kratzbürstig knew it.
He was, as in hedgehog stachelig, yes.
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was just starting an affair, the more promising for a lessening of the lonely, bored of his life than would otherwise have been, and maybe even a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn acquisition was a trembling zarte beauty with flapping of hair and a heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more isolated and rougher than Port Reuben.
It was with an older companion to the south, the Kevern for her aunt, and a plot of land in a damp but heavenly valley, appropriately called the Paradise Valley had inherited.
Over the course of several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leck, in the bathrooms, there were spiders, harvested my potatoes had left their mark on all windows and thought that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, such as huge Kohlköpfe looked.
It was like the house from a Kindermärchen, threatening both how tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the Longlist for the Valesova booker prize 2014.
The shorltist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern and Ailinn händchenhaltend had broken on the sun loungers sat in the high grass and an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag. both had enjoyed the Dienstkonsole eingeklinkt geistesabwesend in the country, with soothing music and soothing news, than the sight of their brown legs crossed to him, an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, was reminded of his father during the closed shutters in the home had.
Your feet are too big.
On the basis of their neat songs of this kind of aggression were not played more on the console.
Not banned - nothing was so right - simply not played.
It has been successful, as the word obsolesziert obsoleszieren.
The general flavour of what rules, edicts and never have done, and how the people in the books, and the erstwhile Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren Liebesromane, so they choose the music the Balllades.
In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns big feet to sing.
Ailinn is not understood.
"this was a well known song of a Jazzpianisten Waller called anyplace", he told her, and put two fingers to his lips automatically.
That his father had always done to the letter J to stop, before he came out of his mouth.
It was a game between him and his father started, when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, as he was told.
If you have a word with a J, start without two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.
It was not a very fun game, and it was also not very funny.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn Antunovits had never heard.
Jazz was, even if he was not directly prohibited, not played.
The Improvisieren was not more modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
The people at the start of a melody to be quite sure, where it would end.
As well as the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was afrikanischer ausgedrückter mind.
Even though he was 10 years old, without of Sammy Davis Junior heard of Kevern, knew something about jazz of the half the secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to explain that not anyplace Ailinn, Waller was black.
At their age, they probably could not remember a time, in the Popsänger were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A guessed society meant that every element of this society based on the principle of the grateful Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful as the fate spared.
People with afro-karibischer origin were by temperament and physique for entertainment and sport, so she sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, as well as by the nature of electronic means were blessed with talent and with the task, to ensure that no family without functioning Diensttelefon remained.
What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks, zerschlug on-teller.
Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as Mahler GESCHEHEN WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN geschah- Mahler, for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, out of fear that the flames, and even they would be next as конкурсов Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants - had opened, and were given with the inaction depressed.
Each according to his abilities.
Because they had heard only Balllades Ailinn, it was difficult to understand how the offensive words, you just had the Kevern vorgesungen, could be set.
Music was an expression of love.
"they are not really insulting", said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too great.
My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security.
The acoustic insulation could not overcome the huge kohlartigen leaves.
Ailinn is still not understood.
Why would something like this should be your father love?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, hesitated, however, in their present two finger to the lips.
You already thought that he was a bit odd.
"it seemed to him", he said, laughing.
She shook her head in disbelief and versperrte Keverns point of view.
There have been all over the world, nothing else to see, as their ungekämmtes rabenschwarzes hair.
There was nothing, what he would want to see.
"if you can say", my it without conviction.
But this still does not explain why you want it to be me vorsingst.
You seemed to be worried, to be honest.
My feet are too big?
He saw once again.
Your feet so directly.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...
And you say, you hate me, because my ankles are too fat?
You hate?
Of course, I do not hate you.
That is, after all, only the stupid song.
He would have been able to say "I love you", but it was still too early.
"your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you give me gefällst", he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
It is not correct.
It was supposed to be funny.
If he was trying to be funny, he was often in trouble, because he, like his father did not have the soothing charm, needed to overcome the inherent cruelty you have to ride.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be, Kevern,.
In spite of its kind eyes.
Ailinn acquisition was red and arose from their deck chair, threw to the console and buried the wine that they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein was drunkenness, so no excuse for him.
In their excitement, it seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel in the storm.
"and your Dickkopf is exactly the reason why I am attracted to you feel perverted", she said.
Except that I am not.
You did him sorry, both because of the unnecessary for his words as well as the fear, which, in their eyes, as they showed against him auflehnte.
She thought that he would beat them?
She had had him from life on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it is, in essence, that was as here.
The same huge and eiskalte Ocean broke here, as there, on the shore.
The same confused men, with even the skin and body height verdrießlicher after THE WHAT GESCHEHEN Mahler than their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, had been moved from pub to pub, always ready to shake the hand of a woman to speak out against them or verlachte refused.
Dickkopf?
They should have shown a big fist, if they are not nice!
You only knutschen - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, to the vacuous Gegengift Liebesballaden from the console - they only knutschen and then beat.
After Keverns view was the result of an unnecessary, since the aging Knutschen itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn acquisition gave him through her body, a sign to go.
He arose from the sun like an old man.
They also felt the brunt of his, but bleiern Caravan-raiding surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She saw him, as he is distant - as in the upper floor of a room in their companion - a man was watching him, complaining through something that he himself had been summoned.
Adam from the Garden, they thought.
You felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some of them had their hands raised.
A man turned away from her, bowed to his back, defeated, ashamed, without fighting spirit - and why was that a sight, they seemed to know well, if they are not at a single time, in which they could remember something like this before the day had already seen?
When she was alone again, looked Ailinn acquisition on her feet.
Several years ago, had just told the trekmovie.com Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-jährige researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative Überwachungsorgan for the public mood, on a short lecture about the continued violence on low and intermediate level in the same areas, in which the reduction, if not abolish, are most likely to have been expected, given the money and energy that the elimination of this violence had been invested.
"a great deal has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done", she wrote, "to the innate aggressiveness of a people to appease the thousands of wars, and most of them won, especially in the remote corners of the country, and in which the sweet breath of human kindness from a historical point of view, despite the Hogmanay Kirchtürme rarely feels between the hedges.
But some properties are as unausrottbar.
The higher the tower, it seems, the lower the passion that he still wakes up.
The people crying, when listening to sentimental Balllades shock stories about brings difficulties and claims, on the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former harshness, the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home, at work, on the roads and even on the green spaces.
"you have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration", said her mentor, as he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less pusztítás.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I believe that I must not say", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you her?
Esme, again, on your right to privacy and the denial of the statement.
Feministin?
Again silence.
"I do not support this", said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I am against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism would be.
This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace.
We serve a vorurteilsfreien society.
But certain types of Hypersensibilität, which in itself is absolutely acceptable and lawful, can occasionally results, as you have presented, they distort.
You obviously have a prejudice against the church, and these things that you as a "deceitful" and "raw" described by others, could just as well of course as an expression of strength and vitality will be interpreted.
If we continue on the herumreitet, WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS, IS, as if it would have happened, if it happened yesterday, means that the country would be essential to take his life.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head in a LED-Schriftzug wiederholte Flamingorosa Ofnow, the advice of the the country in the last quarter century or more had given.
Smile your neighbor, you value their partner, do you hear Balllades, visit musicals, use your phone, you are talking about, do you, listen to you, and I apologise.
Talk is better than silence, philosopher-clergyman word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I completely understand what you want to, and beyond", said Esme walnut with a calm voice, as she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing other than that, we are still not as effective as we are healed, even ourselves.
My concern is that we may find themselves without warning us here, as we repeat the mistakes in the first place, to DEM WHAT IT TAKES IS GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS mannschaftbewerb.
This time, there are but not the other, in which we take our anger and our suspicion.
Luther Rabinowitz, a pyramid with the hands.
To suggest a Engelsgeduld.
"you go too far", he said, "if it acts as a" mistake ", our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far, if you speak about the fact that their "anger" and "suspicion" to "other" had been omitted.
It should not be necessary, someone in your position to remind you that we in the understanding of the past, such as the protection of the present, not of "us" and "other".
There was no "we" and there were no "other".
It was a time of the disorder, that is all we know.
"if we are honest with ourselves", Esme einzuwerfen dared, "not a part of the society can claim to have to behave well.
I klage anyone.
If it was bad or good has been done, what is done is done.
It was at that time.
To do this, nothing more to be said - and here we are unanimous on this.
And just as no blame must be assigned, so there must also be no debt will be repaid, if such a Board would be appropriate and if there is a way, they would have to pay off.
But what is the past, if we do not learn from this -
The past is one that we have forgotten them.
If I have anything to say about that -
Luther Rabinowitz had his piramīdas publication.
"I will remember, their report", he said, and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist, who described how passers-by, in a kind of "murderous rage" on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
