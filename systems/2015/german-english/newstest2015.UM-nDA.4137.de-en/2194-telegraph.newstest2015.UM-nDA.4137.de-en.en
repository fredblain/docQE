Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, whose character has changed things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
As a consulting Anästhesiearzt he devoted himself to the task of his career, the sick and the agony of the disease, as well as the anguish of the treatment to spare.
Among his patients, remembers his wife, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, with the devastating effects of torture had to live.
Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important, while the largely invalid are dealing with a completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, he was, however, the one whose ordeal began.
"I have not felt", he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulty aufzuraffen, me.
While he fought with the soil symptoms, he noticed that he and his wife Juliet chronicles the allegations made.
"I want everything to happen, sooner rather than later", he noted.
As Juliet went away on business on a business trip, Lawson felt quite remarkably shifted and without any reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague, a X-ray Sarpek.
Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray lay before.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the lungs, so the Brustfell überziehende skin.
As with most cancers, is the most difficult to determine the exact cause.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, are not all Lungenkrebserkrankten smokers have been in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost every case, is the catalyst for a Asbestbelastung - contact with the Faserbaustoff, who once was considered as "Wunderstoff" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us is a disease mesothelioma, which can easily ignore.
Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.
The most dangerous type has been in Britain since the 1960's, not used any more, as the industry voluntarily committed to do, this is no longer to use.
There, too, where he was used only in certain industries, people who worked directly with the substance - plumbers, carpenters and construction workers, for example, the shipyard workers.
As an industrial Gefahrstoff from a different time today, he seems to be a cause for concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, saw the at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease and as die in accidents in motor vehicles.
Annual figures from the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and the presumed future deaths in Britain
The reason why we are now witnessing the fatal consequences for years, although asbestos is illegal (in 1999, they have all been banned Asbesttypen), is the one that developed mesothelioma after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction sector.
Asbestos was, and is often still in the houses, in which we live, the offices, in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the shops, where we shop.
And therefore no Klassenschranken piano-chamber mesothelioma, financial limitations, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a bunker.
The Parliament buildings are asbestverseucht.
Even in the hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, but are already as this deadly Karzinogens Ausgangsherde have been identified.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
It was, in fact, hard to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos could be.
Then he put his finger on it.
"it seems as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos". he wrote.
Everybody, students, nurses, doctors, and Pförtner - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will be suffering from the same disease?
This question, unfortunately, he was unable to answer, at least in part.
"of the four doctors at Guy's Hospital were trained, and in the last five years, suffering from mesothelioma", he wrote in a letter, "I am the last one is still alive".
How many of us will get this disease?
In Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only reiterate Lawsons question: "how many of us are still being get disease?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, is that between 1870 and 2050, if the Asbestepidemie in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, it will be a total of 90,000, have fallen victim to the disease will be.
Most of them have no idea at the moment, so that they will die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, the people affected often because of damage, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, to Sulu Allen fahrlässigerweise exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible on the Kleidungsabteilung at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they work in M & S began.
Now, she has two children in the Twenties.
"before this thing", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.
I never would have thought that that would affect me.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact of the matter is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the PVC, the fabric is durable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Asbestos, also known as white asbestos, this is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was for Dachplatten Fußbodenplatten Rohrisolationen Boilerisolierungen,,,, even for brake pads used in cars.
It is less lethal than other Asbestformen, however, is from the EU and the World Health Organization as a "big risk" with possible death.
More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it is clear, however, indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the high Mesotheliomraten was unique".

Sulu Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto, which suggests that their story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected will be presented, in that "a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in the home by Asbestkontakt probably in the environment has caused".
A large part of these contacts is based on his words, the "normal use and ageing of our building.
It looks as though no one could assume, to be sure.
A report by Goddard Consulting, the Palace of Westminster, also shows how people in the heart of the government, unwittingly exposed to the substance may have been.
In 2009, reported that the Serviceschächte and pipes behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres by something as harmless as "strong air movements" could be an outcry.
MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests, but here, it looks as if the opposite is taking place.
While the direction of the Parliamentary Arbeitsdienstes insisting that the Westminsterpalast Gesundheitszeugnis received a "clean", it is now undisputed that £1 billion over the course of several years of work that needs to be paid to the Parliament to be renovated, the electronic installations to modernise and to remove the asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015 are the Members will meet in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard-Bericht also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the respective provisions has been handled".
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person, the contact with asbestos could never determine exactly is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott that he was during his work in hospitals, the asbestos was exposed to.
"I have worked in a hospital, Asbestklagen were decided in the positive", he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to get to all the places where you have to remember that, and has worked on the data.
What exactly is he still recalls the day in early December 2009, he had a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was just an operation by late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It was all of a sudden.
I felt awful.
I believed that the home not to create more.
As a doctor, knew Abbott that the pain from the Brustfell, the skin around his lungs around herrührten.
But, as Captain Sulu Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He went a month not to work.
Doctors were surprised his chest X-ray and Pleurakathether, in order to remove fluid from the lungs, and in the laboratory to test.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health stabilized slowly, and he returned to his job back.
From time to time, however, the symptoms return, often after high-solubility and fierce breahing.
In 2011, Abbott was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, this is not the Abbott with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older, and had worked with asbestos.
The link in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his family brought his CT-Scans and X-ray to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between Rippen- and introduced the Brustfell.
I am an optimist.
I usually just kept on going, "he says.
To be honest, I had so many worries me not at all.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "you told me that it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott appointments with Macmillan-Krankenschwestern, one of which, it is recommended to take a lawyer.
Only now, he understood the scale of the epidemic.
"it turned out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings, where pipes with asbestos were often isolated", he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, ill now.
And so is mesothelioma now younger people, not in the typical professions have been working on.
The most dangerous tubes with Asbestisolierungen führten in hospitals under the earth, so patients are more likely not to have been exposed to the substance.
But many employees, from one building to another Fußgängertunneln changed (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott (as it often did), with most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He is still away.
Students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten.
And it is not only hospitals.
Asbestos was due to its efficiency and flammhemmenden properties are often in offices, shops, libraries and Stadthallen used.
Schools, too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first Asbestkontakt in the classroom.
Across the country, thousands of Chemiestunden, have students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten.
On Web sites will be the issue of asbestos in schools now often mentioned.
And meanwhile have so innocent items in our houses like Fußbodenplatten Schuppendächer contain asbestos or by default.
"it's a Industriegift that, in large parts of our real estate", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, Andrew Lawson in his trial, Guy's Hospital.
In one case, was the only contact, of an affected woman, suddenly the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970's.
So you go on, as you shed your mattress.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"it takes a while to digest", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work, and tried to carry on, but I realized that I could not focus on that, what I was doing.
I was two weeks ago in practice.
Then, I knew that I go to and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective of the position of a medical doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he recalls, as he was overwhelmed by all the information was, with whom he had to come.
"it was very hard, all of this", he says.
"I asked my doctor how long I have?"
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Oh, yes, I will not see another Christmas.
That's it then. ""
Mesothelioma is a particularly treacherous, because it is our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breahing itself - is that the deadly cancer.
Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by Asbestkontakt.
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.
If the asbestos fibres and the outcry will be inhaling, they can in the Brustfell, the skin around the lungs, to be determined.
Asbestos fibres can irritate and cause the Brustfell Zellmutationen.
"the problem is with the inhalierten nadelförmigen asbestos fibres", says Professor Tom Treasure, a Herz-Thorax-Arzt, the 2001 at Guy's Hospital.
This is exactly what the hospital, of which Andrew Lawson suggested that it has suspended the asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and a few others, the probably also during their training in hospital after they were exposed to asbestos.
As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe, says Treasure, "they will be of the Atemvorgang to the edge, where the skin is.
It is by its nature invasive right from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers in mesothelioma does not work so well.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some say that it was worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"it is possible the Brustfell not under pressure", he says.
They come with the knife did not beat about the bush.
Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy is not very good", the "effect", but not heals.
"sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende", says Treasure.
But at the end of the day, they all die.
Fortunately, some of the patients, in fact, live a long time, much longer than expected.
The author, Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fighting.
After he contacted Abbott had mesothelioma, came in contact with Andrew Lawson, of the four years after his diagnosis a Ein-Mann-Unterstützungs- and consultancy for Mitbetroffene had become.
"hello, Krebszentrale", he cheerfully on calls.
"he was very positive", says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott six Chemotherapiezyklen were originally offered the four months, and his life is only expected to last a month, would be extended.
"I was desperate", he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, was "the things in a more positive light".
Following the advice of several doctors decided to Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Herz-Thorax-Spezialist Lang-Lazdunski, at Guy's.
"we had an advantage because of the fact that I have not had to be weiterverwiesen, I called right away and got a date", Graham.
A normal patient would receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is a key factor for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte the best available therapies, in order to be able to perceive.
But if these treatments fail, after all, inevitably, there are many people of a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"it is known that asbestos since 1898, is extremely dangerous for the health", says Morgan.
In the 1960s, but what has changed is that we realized that even a very low burden was a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies have a role to play.
Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, after all with their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation", as Lawson not with absolute certainty, that could prove to be a mesothelioma Asbestkontakt at Guy's.
After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres in the affected Kellerbereich in the 1990's have been removed".
This was too late for Andrew Lawson.
Such as asbestos may be removed
It is, in fact, for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte, to seek compensation, a huge problem, the deadly Asbestkontakt a company or a job on the frequency - normally decades after the events.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.
Versicherungsunterlagen can be lost.
And those who defend itself against the claims, know that the time for it, but it is certainly not with recognised the authors.
In response, there has been strong this year, the new legislation makes it easier for Mesotheliom-Betroffene beforeany, compensation, even if their former employers are no longer here.
The law has one of the insurance industry, supported by funds of £350 million for all established, diagnosed after July 2012, a contact can prove, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court would have them in a normal Schadensersatzprozess zusprechen can - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-Betroffene that £350 million in a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"It's a deal of insurance for insurers", he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time is not known, and it would be the company and they find Mesotheliom-Erkrankte normal could sue.
Also, Mike Penning, who was working and Pensionsminister, has acknowledged that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning as Morgan gave to that, in the face of seven deaths every day a quick action was necessary.
"the people are suffering so much and need help", said Penning today during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-Gesetzes in December of last year.
At this point in time was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After their first debate Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he, unlike Tom Treasure is expected to have a positive effect.
This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - accompanied by a Dreifachtherapie Lang-Lazdunski, with a survival rate of more than five years of up to 40 percent can present.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"this is, of course, with the most important thing", says Abbott.
You can see that again in patients.
There is something that you can just carry on.
If you aufgibst, it is you very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six Chemotherapiezyklen behind.
Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There have been several Krebs-Flecken to my chest.
I was just 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's lebensbeendend.
Abbott again underwent six Chemotherapiezyklen.
Now, there is no trace of the tumors more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.
You have to think about practical things - on the money, if not more, for example, am I, or my wife, show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Elly, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"for parents, It's difficult", he says.
It is difficult to know what we should say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I have a disease, with which I would not grow old.
They were quite different.
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable.
They told their friends and we soon got very many calls.
Elly was Lapajne.
She said not much.
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope, and not a trace of hope of survival.
The disease will eventually also (like Stephen Jay Gould) for a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
