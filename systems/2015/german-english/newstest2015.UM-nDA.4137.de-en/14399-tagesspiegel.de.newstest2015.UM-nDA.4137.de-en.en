Matthies says: it's time for the big Vernetzen
In the light of technical progress, the galloping home in our stylish comfort High-Tech-Schaltzentralen threatens to transform our columnist Bernd Matthies with a very familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my view on the Spiralkabel, the audience connects with the phone, and I think: how retro Boah, is that it?
But what is behind this is a consideration: if the cable, would not be in the shortest possible time all listeners herrenlos happier in the house, and that would still be significantly more retro.
Already is, of course, to the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typo: electronic) sector is the rule that the novelty of the electronic waste of tomorrow is, bought - out of date.
And who, for example, still in the living room has a CRT, which says only that he rejects that, in principle, on television.
Which is why these considerations?
Because we do the Ifa Andr√§ngen radio tower, in this week of our absolute incompetence in questions of the electronics show.
To the layman, the washing machine and drive blind, was not even understand the purpose of the devices, which, with incredible eitlem Expertensprech spread before him: "connected home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yes, it's still?
What should you talk with people, who appear to be of such voluntary Quark spread?
Basically, this is, of course, for some 20 years ago, is that we should be doing our house network.
So even the original order, the yoghurt to the Brandmelder on holiday in the Maldives, in the office, that it just burns.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we from the office from the air conditioning in our early arrival...?
Yes, it is, however, an air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly soon be true: we raise our watch, say their according to "sucking!" - and at home, the Staubsaugroboter.
Misleading.
It all amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "the boundaries between white and brown goods and raunt a industry experts", the washing machine, you can connect with a set of headphones, the purchasing power of the weather and sending the Datenbrille indicates how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but what is of no use, because we in the traffic jam.
From the daily practice, we also know: if a neumodisches device really is needed, the battery is empty.
Which is another reason for this is that the Spiralkabel on the phone the next Funkausstellungen will survive.
