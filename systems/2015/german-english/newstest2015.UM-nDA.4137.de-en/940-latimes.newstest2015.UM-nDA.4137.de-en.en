Putin demands of Kiev the inclusion of "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with the eastern Ukraine
The Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskow made clear later that Putin does not have to mean that, under the control of the separatists in the area of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia, but that his status in relation to the Ukraine needs to be redefined, to the power of the Russian-speaking region to the representation of his rights and interests.
Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal footing with the pro-russischen fits to the insurgents, but from him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently pursued strategy: to provide support for the separatists in the Einnehmen of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government, to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for a alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted in the area as "Novorossija" or "Yeni Dünya", a concept that goes to the heart of the pre-revolutionary to restore the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all of those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt. and while Regierungsgruppen civilian communities in the areas held by the separatists attack on an early peace talks hope "in their illusions" are caught, told Itar-Tass.
"we need to immediately begin detailed discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus the Südostukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there", he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy, the need to be seen for months by the Kiev leadership is discussed, in Russian-speaking areas in order to allay fears that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskow.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in the Ukraine".
The clarification of the Kremlsprechers to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of the Crimea, the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants, no Russians are, and surveys from the time before the conflict, a large majority for staying in the Ukraine.
The autonomy of the Russian diplomats on international forums has been raised, would the regional governments in the Ukraine, to give authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and as the Kremlin's de facto control of a territory, the Russian territory of Crimea.
Five months ago, annexed the peninsula in the Black Sea is the home base for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, the important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech to the inauguration on June 7, before that the Ukrainian legislation, amendments to the constitution after the elections - should consider where the respective areas, with greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his idea of autonomy, which seems to be in the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand, their weapons, and Moscow is accused of incitement.
Putin's last call to Kiev, with the Separatistenführern to negotiate on equal footing, was followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Asowschen sea in the eastern Ukraine are entered.
Supported by Russia, the separatists took over 1519-1563 Sicherheitsbeamter according to the fears of the first step in a campaign to take on the strategic coastal region to the Crimea is, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, the massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol, a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants, to fortify the between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU-Führung in Brussels and asked for urgent actions in order to further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic to prevent, the 23 years of independence.
"we are on the eve of a point at which there is no turning back", warned Poroshenko.
Tens of thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
No, the EU summit decided to concrete actions, the leadership, the draft further sanctions against Russia, in an escalation of the Ukrainekrise unspezifizierten should come into force.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian overpowering and 1,000 soldiers last week in the encroaching Donezkregion, in order to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Andrij ruling, the spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence General Reporten on Saturday in Kiev.
