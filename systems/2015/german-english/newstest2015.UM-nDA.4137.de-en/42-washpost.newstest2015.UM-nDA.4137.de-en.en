Tax burden of business people in the area of Washington is increasing along with the economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local Steuerbescheide for companies in the country in the last year, rose slightly, while the economic recovery is accelerating, according to a new study published in the past week, and the companies in the area of Washington, were no exception.
Companies in the area of the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27,6 billion to state and local authorities in the fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared to the revenues of 2012 in the amount of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the companies in the last year, rose 4.3 per cent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year before, and it was the third consecutive growth after several years of decline expected in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes have increased more than the local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by Ernst & Young, the Maintenance with the Center for State taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe was carried out.
More than half of the tax revenue of the District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of the revenues come from businesses Marylands.
Virginia scored with 28% the lowest tax revenues from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery in the company's investment, say the researchers, leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern to 3.7 percent this year, according to the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.
While a large proportion of these profits from big states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also true for the Washington area.
Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local Immobiliensteuern last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year to 4.2 per cent.
But the apparent recovery in the Immobilienwerten in Maryland is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenue, because here the Immobiliensteuern to barely more than a fifth of the Steuerbescheide of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.
"in Maryland, the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the Steuergebiet to D.C., is either owned by the government, or by non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern", said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on the State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to, for example, is much more on the personal income taxes to leave, in order to be able to offer the same services, the other states offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot alone be the recovery of the property market
Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover, so the data.
Businesses in the region have reported income of about $2.3 billion in Staatsorganisationen compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took a $1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend in the same direction, increases the local tax burden for companies not evenly to all three places.
The pace of the District was 4.3 per cent, with the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches 武三思 of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 percent in all three of the least Amtsbereichen autonoumus Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern (in all three there are fixed income-tax).
The Unternehmenssteuersatz is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.
A similar study of the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, and state and local taxes are required and there is generally a better Steuerklima than in Maryland.
In the study, the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has to reduce its income-tax laws this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will be launched next year to 5 percent decline.
If the state continues to be his Einkommensziele in the coming year, this law could be achieved the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz until 2017 the state up to 3 per cent.
In the meantime, it seems that it is the small businesses in the Washington area, better to go, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the most recent study.
Corporate taxes, personal income taxes as paid by small business people - a Übergangsstruktur, after most of the small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia in the last year, rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in the whole country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general Mehrwehrsteuereinnahmen for the state and local governments to 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Washington, however, could be the space behind, if the spending of the federal government on the labour market in the region.
