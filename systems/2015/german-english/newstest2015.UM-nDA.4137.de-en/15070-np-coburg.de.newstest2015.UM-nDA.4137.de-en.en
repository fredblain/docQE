In a statement to the press, it contradicts statements of CEO Peer Medau and attested to this, "like a tapestry" to pose.
The style of the university that was not, it says in the communication.
So the family was already "in the middle of June, Medau orally about the aspiration of the university have been informed.
The statement that the plans were known only in July, are definitely wrong, "so Pötzl.
At the same time, he refers to the fact that it is not in the plans to "Vorfestlegungen or even decisions", it is, however, "preferences".
Also the access necessary for the expansion of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
Of the nine metres wide road was, and is, not the speech.
It goes to the current state to 5.50 meters, that is a metre wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
The argument that their Stacchus Medau-Betreiber schuleigenen parking in the future and will only be used by students from the University of Applied Sciences, wants to let Pötzl do not apply.
Zugeparkt is not at all, because, as with other public car parks now intelligent can solve.
Think of the residents
The nursery Bergwichtel, on the site, which is located on the doorstep and along the access route to the scanners would lead, according to the Hochschulpräsidenten "should not be compromised".
Rather, it is to be remembered, "that this is not just about the nursery, but also about the people living along the river to the 800 students Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the neighbouring Primary School.
It's so much more than the vested interests of the gentlemen ", Medau Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the Elternbeirats the nursery, with the construction of the road would be one of the few natural spots Coburgs lost was "justified", the reader can decide for themselves. "
At the beginning of October Pötzl will together with the State Public Works of the councillors on the structural development of the university DreamTents "by 2020 and, in this regard, the importance of the new Überhäufung address".
Peer Medau had last week, the parents of the nursery on the plans of the university informed.
According to the airfield for the new scanners do not like so far about the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but about the Medau-Berg.
So that would have to be the narrow road about a kilometre in length will be upgraded.
According to the projections of the Medaus would get the traffic in the park of the chateau at Hohenfels it tenfold.
Of about 2000 vehicles every day is the speech.
On the part of the city if they want not to comment on the project so far.
