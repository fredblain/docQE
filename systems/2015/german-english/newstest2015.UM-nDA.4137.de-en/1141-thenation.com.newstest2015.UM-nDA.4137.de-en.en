Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal, the organization of trade unions to establish as a citizen.
"as trade unions are dying, the Mittelklassejobs also die", said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and the deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
That's why I'm proud to work together with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz.
This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organization of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces.
The addition of the national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes, a way for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a Gewerkschaftsvertretung to create before a civil court to get justice to complain - and in order to get compensation or Strafgelder - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understanding what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, the trade unions, which have been subjected to in the last few years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries all over the world, encouraged to recognise and comply with labour rights, expand.
There was a time, of the millions of Americans still remember, when this country democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the Vereinigungsrecht in one breath.
When the United States after the Second World War, Japan besetzte, encouraged General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff in the country to do so, to adopt a constitution, which should ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, took a role, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of the workers to unite and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed".
When the United States after World War II, Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff the Germans, to write a constitution, which would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise themselves, and their voice in the new nation should speak up, added a clause to the Germans, the aussagte explicitly: "the right to form associations, and to the working and economic conditions will improve, and to secure to each and every individual and every profession or industry.
The agreements, which restrict this right or aimed at it to belittle are null and void; this is abzielende measures are illegal.
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was designed in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, has been taken over by Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that "everyone has the right to protect its interests, trade unions to form or join them".
For generations, Americans accept the Grundprämisse that labour rights are human rights.
When this country, in other countries, such as one civilian and democratic societies, said Americans could form, that the law on the establishment of a trade union - and that this trade union collective bargaining, then as an equal partner with companies and government agencies must take part in - must be protected.
After these rights in America under attack, it is indeed very wise, the American ideal and, consequently, to the working population must have the right to unite and engage in a free and open society in which to speak.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:
The history is a great teacher.
Now we all know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation, but they grew.
By raising the living standards of millions of people in work has miraculously created a market for the industry and the whole of the nation to unimaginable levels increased.
Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but the history they keep.
The story reminds us, and that is something we should do.
The formal recognition of the labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past, and the promise of democracy einlösten.
