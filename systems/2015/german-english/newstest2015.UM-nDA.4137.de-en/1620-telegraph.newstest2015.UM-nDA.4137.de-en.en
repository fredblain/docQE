Lenny Henry: my father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry Carioca for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, the partly on an imaginary conversation with his father, and from the series is based on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively tunes.
But Henry has had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
We never saw his face, only heard his voice: 'with the blowup.
Don't let your sister in peace and quiet.
Provided you!
I want to look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the Bierglases or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner, read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the times of his father, he won but an insight into how life must have been like for him.
It's a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep stygische Flammenstößen maze with smoke and soot, and much more.
My father used to simply put in the bath and then you could hear him slowly, as he started to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.
Irish as I was there, I was clear that he had done this for many years, in order to put food on the table, and my respect for him has been greater.
However, Henry as a child who grew up without his parents Liebesbezeugungen.
My father never embraced me, never, he said, "I love you".
It was only when my mother at the end of her life was bad, we started to, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
By his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love as a child, he had gone missing.
Could you with the "I love you" stop?
Listen to me, however, to hug!!!
Dad, I'm 22!!!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a French friend, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.
So I moved this Fitnessding through and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one eats like carrots.
Henrys Karrierewechsel shows, perhaps, in his elegant, kurzgeschnittenen Bart.
Since he retired from the critics for his Othello was lauded by the theatre, he is captured.
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then adhesive of August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the comedies, such as "the busy working life have to be filled out.
He started with just 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage, as he people imitierte and wrote to New Faces on him.
His Fernsehkarriere began in the 1970s. "I was for a long time the only black impersonator / comedian on television".
He learned in the profession.
I had to not only before the eyes of the public, but will also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine through the television, while I was a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny on New Faces in 1975.
As his manager the Bühnenrecht at the Black and White minstrel show Ganzenberg, a light entertainment programme, in which the "black people", said Henry anmalten his comedy there about five years on.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish somehow, it never would have happened, but I regret that I did not have.
It was a weird, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on Riesenprojekten with and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "Wieloletnie award-winning light pillar of the British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
Through the introduction of the figures, the British black culture both deride as SAMAVAYO Henry in the Eighties, he worked on an alternative Comedykreis.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the unmentionables, boss!.
Advertising, documentaries, and TV and film is dominated by the next decade, but after his BBC-Serie LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "what are you doing next, Len, it is because they are all so feeling, when you have the time, or only around trittst a little on the spot".
Then came a documentary for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was virtually allergic to Shakespeare.
I was in the school never really learned something about him and kept him mostly for a preserve of the middle class, White in tights and a Kohlkopf WordReference front.
So I had a great fear.
To all the people we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should give it a try.
Make it not bad, if you do not know what you are talking.
Pick a few of the words in your mouth, and you will understand why we are all so love Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was so excited about it.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It's almost as if somebody gave me the head finally set up correctly.
"that is what it is, it is a serious matter, take them seriously, get your text, a bit chaotic.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece before we made it for months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that is simply not happening.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed". "
There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he needs to talk to the audience.
"a little voice said to me" you will have to bridge is now 10 minutes, while the computer reparieren. ""
Instead, he announced that the idea of the Bühnenleiter April, as soon as the problem was resolved.
I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can leave it to someone else.
"you're playing in a play, so stay in your role".
Henry in adhesive on the Duchess Theatre
The text for the adhesive to learn was demanding.
Panic is very good, this reinforces the tendons.
Also this was good, so it is like a big sign of the gods, I say "here is your destiny". "
He says that, of course, with a thundering voice.
So I maintain.
I love the really.
I love it, to be in a Probenraum.
Henry, but still the head of a comedian - our conversation is of humorous outbreaks, while it is always people imitated.
I have decided to not to make Stand-up-Comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for, one that swearing in front of a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo on, if I want to have, but, overall, there is not as much as before.
I ask him whether he ever will again make a Stand-up-Comedytour.
The fun of it, I was in a room with a director, the help you have a beginning, a middle, and the end of a journey to form - I do not believe that I would like to give up ever again.
So here is the new incarnation?
I think it is.
I am quite an actor.
It's fun.
You can always tell a story, and this is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
