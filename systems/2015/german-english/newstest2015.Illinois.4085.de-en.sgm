<seg id="1">Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis, have the right to establish the organisation of trade unions, tabled a legislative proposal.</seg>
<seg id="3">', such as trade unions, die die the Mittelklassejobs, ``said Ellison, Caucus a democrat in Minnesota and Vice-Chairman of the Congressional in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, I am proud of that, together with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes, to organise a union representation to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers in order to complain about justice before a civil court - and to receive compensation or Strafgelder - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks in recent years, the trade unions - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, Americans will extend to comply with labour rights and encourage countries all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time in which millions of Americans, as this country is democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States after the Second World War, Japan had occupied, General Douglas' Arthur and his staff, which ensure the country to adopt a Constitution that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. "</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers have to organise themselves, and their voice heard in the new nation, a German added a clause which explicitly aussagte: 'the right to safeguard the employment and economic conditions and to improve to form associations, individuals and guaranteed any trade or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed to are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them."</seg>
<seg id="17">Since generations the Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">As other countries in this country, as we build civil and democratic societies, told Americans that the right of trade unions to the creation and protection - that this trade union will participate as an equal partner with companies and government agencies in collective bargaining it should.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights in America come under attack, it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fifty years ago, as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said:</seg>
<seg id="21">The story is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">We all know that the workers' movement, the strength of the nation, but not increased.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Forget those who attack the work these simple truths, but they kept the story.</seg>
<seg id="25">The story recalls, and we should do this.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employees' representatives, is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Renew Keith Ellison and John Lewis the ideals that America has made in the past, and the promise of democracy einlösten.</seg>

<seg id="3">Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should the current Verbotsverfahrens find an end to the Federal Constitutional Court against the National Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-country chief in Baden-Württemberg, the Leipziger Volkszeitung. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">The NPD has been very close to the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="7">A first attempt for a ban on the extreme right-wing party was because the Verfassungsschutz at that time in the NPD-tip informers had failed in 2003.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: my father has never in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said ``I love you ''</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father died when he was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively Melodien.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente.</seg>
<seg id="8">He went to ``many ''therapies, following the death of his mother, and Henry is thought about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was difficult to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">We never saw his face, only to hear his voice: 'listen to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let your sister in peace and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Beweg you!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A large part of my life, he was the serious type in the corner of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is high time, but they are dark verraucht, deep stygische maze with Flammenstößen and smoke and soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him has been growing.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when it is my mother at the end of their life is bad, we started, ``I love you, I love you, I love you ''.</seg>
<seg id="24">Through his own daughter Billie, Dawn French, he disappeared as a child he had to share the love.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you let's stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">But to listen to hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I am 22.</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why shouldn't we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is with which he married 25 years was friends with French.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good one.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henrys own mother was a diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I was very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes, said my doctor'you must be radically.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet, in order to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is demanding.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one is happy to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henrys Karrierewechsel is perhaps in its elegant, kurzgeschnittenen Bart.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece, he is captured by the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years, when he was working in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="49">He got in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star on television, and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in 1975 in New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">As the Bühnenrecht managers in the Black and White Minstrel Show '', had a slight Unterhaltungsprogramm in which people'black anmalten, led his musical comedy Henry there about five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family was very unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="54">Somehow, I wish that it would never happen, but I regret that I have done it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on Riesenprojekten and knew how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this' years of prize-winning easy pillar of the British television'was also a bizarre parody of black people'.</seg>
<seg id="57">With the introduction of characters, which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like, when you're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first consequence was to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage at the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had great fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.</seg>
<seg id="66">Please do not bad, if you do not know what you redest.</seg>
<seg id="67">Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry on led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was excited.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I was able to do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="71">``therefore, it is a serious matter, take it seriously lern your text, a recherchiere bit.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed to be an accident, and this happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon joined in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a time when I thought, 'Oh, you have changed you'.</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A small voice told me" You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead of Bühnenleiter announced that the idea of opening, as soon as the problem solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I was on the scene and something I said'Oh, thank God'.</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, so stay in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry the Duchess Theatre in Fences</seg>
<seg id="86">To learn the text for Fences was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, that strengthens tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">It also sold well, so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say, 'This is your destiny. ""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says that, of course, with a dramatic voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I will say it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly people imitated.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If that is so, it all goes against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want it, but overall, I am not as much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is the new personification?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It is fun.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is with a proud fame than from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own Fronterfahrung.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began in the global Managementberatungsunternehmen bain and so on, as they Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media of Pearsons changed.</seg>

<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust works in two directions: Inside on the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety, if things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the new incoming president would be to risk to take on everything and the complex is like a Chinese dynasty, auseinanderzunehmen an institution in itself, it is perhaps his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if that were not enough, even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of 145,50 GBP per year is buying the British public in the probably biggest media companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: She says that they reached 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently, the BBC on the popularity scale back up: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sight and Nutzungsgewohnheiten for the BBC have changed: I get Nachrichtenschlagzeilen today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on my iPlayer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berkeley declared housing to'normal'.</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing ''returned to normal levels in the south-east of England.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to enormous price increases, and the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit boom that led to set limits on mortgage in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013," and added that this is a "stable environment" offer.</seg>
<seg id="5">The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, because foreign buyers pushed in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information from the Katasteramts are the prices in the city have increased by leaps and bounds to 18.5% in the last year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling prices of Berkeleys private, cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villas" tax before the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London real estate agents Foxtons warned last week that the Hypothekenmarktbericht for April, presented in the tougher Kreditvergaberegelungen, such as the prices lead to lower growth in both the Immobilienverkauf in the second half of this year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Bank of England on Monday new data show a decline in the mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions International, a different Immobilienagentur, corrected his prediction for the increase in property prices in London for 2015 down to 3%, on the basis of an already faltering Hauspreisbewußtseins.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction limit in the most expensive areas of London Mayfair and Kensington and Chelsea, year on year, is now reduced to a quarter, so the broker Wa Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon to Berkeley, because the sums due to date sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: ``the demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the Terminverkäufe'remained stable.</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent to £280 million, sales at 18 per cent to £1.6 billion annually.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to comply with the current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysts estimate in the annual Vorsteuerergebnis to 450 million.</seg>

<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.</seg>
<seg id="82">For example, it is not for revenge, he is the last answer overwhelmed.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends in the class and sometimes they go into the Sporthalle, candles and light.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller, he including - I remember how he sometimes on the SOFA, the face of us away, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not schlafend, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. - is now 17, bigger than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that, for a few hours, I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">As I am a following the explosion and the legs came, I saw, and saw the hell around me, with all herumliegenden body parts.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">``I remember that I shouted at him'Damir, lauf, lauf away '', but I was sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But it has one and it is weggelaufen.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so it goes on life, unlike many others, for us.</seg>

<seg id="96">Be blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear, as he Chechen terrorists his Klassenkameraden niederschossen, running his life.</seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had it before they came to get rid of the University of their older son Vladimir, sold on his first day.</seg>
<seg id="99">``I left the farm about two minutes, the terrorists stormed before him, and so was my little boy for three terrible days alone, 'it remembers.</seg>

<seg id="101">I let only managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">As the date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would be a few scenes from these days I have always done yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget that, I assure you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgent: The image of born (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school, he said that he wants to embrace his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew that it was, as I saw it on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there are even this statue of weinenden let in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Born does not like the image, and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.</seg>
<seg id="112">Born today says: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">We will know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">The horror of this world.</seg>
<seg id="118">I cannot understand how it is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget a little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I am still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I was later in the year 2004 and was back to school every day.</seg>

<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is actually a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>

<seg id="152">Physically, it is good to me.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be very careful with my injured knees, but I can now well under way.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have submitted my papers, including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible.</seg>

<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations in his memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that born will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even more intense for him, because he was there and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was at home at him and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and all of them are drawn in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Let is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to accept that, if a little so Unfaires experience.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he may sport, but it can not be due to its knees.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would like to see it resolved the horror to 50%, but that cannot be overcome and never completely forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will follow.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only my pain.</seg>

<seg id="178">I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows, never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if it does not want.</seg>
<seg id="180">I would like my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now, I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe almost.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many more are being killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you like to make photographs or videos under water, there is a choice of equipment.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are to be had for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump, you will see to what extent your equipment is operational.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others by 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are you looking for in our Einkaufsführer and assessments for digital cameras for traditional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots, because many will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat, with which you can compose images, action-cams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right attitude is a matter of chance.</seg>
<seg id="16">So make many recordings.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a terraced mode, in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings, use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light will be dramatically worse, the further you remove themselves from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible you should stay so close to the surface, if you recordings in a pool, a lake or sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Go close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is also a good Council under water, but it is all the more important because of the bad there.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is particularly important, if you are working with a Action-Cam: this equipment often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse, which means that you are close to your objects, if they have to fill in the whole Bildrahmen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the species, whose character things changed, even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, his wife, was a MI6-staff, with the devastating effects of torture live.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors, the diagnosis and diseases are important, while the treated mainly deals with something quite different: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, he was the one, however, the ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">``I have not felt, ''he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had to raise difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.</seg>
<seg id="9">''I want everything at once, rather than later, he quoted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anything was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago, he had been for skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the radiological examination before.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, the Brustfell, i.e. the lungs überziehende skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, some smokers with lung disease, have been all Lungenkrebserkrankten sooner smokers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material, once regarded as the "miracle material" but has now been recognized as fatal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease which can be as easy to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, where he was working only people in certain sectors directly with the substance, builders, plumbers and carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial Gefahrstoff from another time, it seems to be only very worrying.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">The United Kingdom, it seems, is experiencing today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and likely future deaths in the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999) were banned all types of asbestos, is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of mesothelioma is limited to a former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, often, still present in the houses, in which we live, the offices in which we work, schools, in which we learn and the shops where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma, financial limits, jobs or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no protection.</seg>
<seg id="35">The buildings are asbestverseucht.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals, in which we are healthy, have been identified as Ausgangsherde this deadly Karzinogens.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was difficult for him, in fact, to imagine that he may have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found out it.</seg>
<seg id="41">``it looks as if the tunnels in the Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years my training was that there was a lot of asbestos. ''he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and guard - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my counterparts are suffering from the same illness?</seg>
<seg id="44">This question he could answer, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">``from the four doctors trained's Hospital on Guy, and in the last five years to mesothelioma sick '2010 in a letter he wrote,' I am the last, is still alive ''.</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us are still fall ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long survival time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still fall ill?"</seg>
<seg id="53">Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the moment, most of them have no idea that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the courts, in which people often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, have to be exposed to asbestos, Janice Allen negligent way.</seg>
<seg id="58">They worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allan was only 18 years as when they operate in M & S began.</seg>
<seg id="60">She now has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">``in this matter, ''says, 'I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not really about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that I would affect the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name comes from the word ``Asbestiform ', a description of the substance Faserstruktur resilient and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used for roof panels, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still seen as a "major health risk" with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">Dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of braunem asbestos, and experts assume that'it is clear, however, there are indirect evidence that this is one of the main reasons for the unique high Mesotheliomraten was'.</seg>
<seg id="72">A staff of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the Oxford Street, London in Flagshipstore Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice everyone has seen as typical Mesotheliomopfer maybe not, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that "a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">In his statement, a large proportion of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as if no one expected to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could also be in the heart of the government, have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 reported that the Goddard Serviceschächte and pipelines contaminated with asbestos behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament, whose deadly fibres are caused by something as harmless, such as ``strong Luftbewegungen.</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of Parliament to look after their own interests, often accused, but here it seems, as would have been the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean" health certificate, it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report has also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who never define precisely the contact with asbestos was is Graham Abbott, a general practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson suspected of the 50-year-old Abbott that he exposed to asbestos in hospitals during his work.</seg>
<seg id="86">``I have been working in a hospital, in the Asbestklagen ', says,' but I can in my case do not show it.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is difficult, in which they have worked, to remind you of all places, and the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and had an operation in late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had Schüttelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="91">It was very suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I did not believe more to create the journey home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of Brustfell, the skin around his lungs resulted.</seg>
<seg id="95">But as Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He went to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Doctors have Verwunderte Röntgenaufnahmen his chest and put Pleurakathether to flow from the lungs and test laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, but without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health slowly stabilized, and he returned to his job back.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time the symptoms returned back, however, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, a patient Abbott's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now, Abbott combined this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">More generally, I am simply, ``he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest, I had not so much concern to me.</seg>
<seg id="110">But my wife, Rachel, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the Biopsie was in the week between Christmas and New Year: 'I said to me that it was ``mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott diagnosis mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott dates with Macmillan-nurses, one of which he recommended to take a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now realised the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes often isolated with asbestos, ``he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who are exposed to asbestos in these buildings were affected.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so is now mesothelioma younger people, who worked in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with Asbestisolierungen in hospitals were under the earth, so patients are exposed to the substance is probably not.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott (as it often did), most likely came in contact with the toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It shows that on several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives, but life-threatening for the sending of doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still a long way off.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos has been used in offices, shops, libraries and Stadthallen often because of its wonderful-isolating and flammhemmenden properties.</seg>
<seg id="125">Even schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile, items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">``it is a Industriegift that included in large parts of our property is' Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, Andrew Lawson represented's Hospital against Guy in the process.</seg>
<seg id="131">In any case, was the only contact one of the woman, the demolition of Gartenschuppens invaded in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So, as you remove your Gartenschuppen.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the cure is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process it," Mr Abbott said.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I discovered that I am not able to focus on what I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">Two weeks ago I was in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I shall have no further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before he reminds himself, as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very difficult to absorb all of this," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">``I asked my doctor'as long as I have?'</seg>
<seg id="143">And it gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, 'well, I shall have no further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">The summits'.</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious, because our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breathing itself - is that the fatal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by Asbestkontakt mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled, they can establish themselves in the chest fur, the skin around the lungs,.</seg>
<seg id="150">Irritate the Brustfell asbestos fibres and can trigger Zellmutationen.</seg>
<seg id="151">The problem is with the nadelförmigen actually inhaled asbestos fibres, as Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax-doctor, 2001 the Guy's Hospital changed.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with a number of other exposed to asbestos in the hospital which also probably during their training.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe Treasure, says, 'they are pushed to the margins of the Atemvorgang, where the skin.</seg>
<seg id="155">Naturally it is invasive from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is highly controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"The breast skin cannot be cut out," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">They come with the knife not beat about the bush.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy is not very good," the "effect," but not healed.</seg>
<seg id="163">Sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende ``, ''says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, there are some really long, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould, 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">``hello, Krebszentrale ', he happily on telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally Abbott, the last four months and extend only a month of life would be likely to have been offered six Chemotherapiezyklen.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson managed ``. to appear in a slightly more positive light the things.</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">``we had a benefit I telephoned and got a date, that I would be referred to'are Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would transfer must be and must wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers, to be able to play the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments, inevitably fail, many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson kontaktierte Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898," Morgan says.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what the 1960ern modified is that we realised that a very low cost a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the company began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">According to the study of his death, a spokesman for the Guy's, however, that'the asbestos fibres in the 1990s in the affected Kellerbereich. ``</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation, to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers are sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them, but certainly not with the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response to this in this year there were significant new legislation for mesothelioma-affected easier, even if they are no longer find former employer, to demand compensation.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry, which were diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but cannot sue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Mr Morgan is like so many mesothelioma-350 million people, for a very good piece of work'of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally.</seg>
<seg id="200">Mike Penning, then work and pensions minister, admitted that the law is "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning as Morgan admitted that, in the face of seven deaths every day a swift action is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">``the people are suffering so much and are now in need of aid, ''said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma-law in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At that time was Graham Abbott since 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first debate, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, with the most important thing," Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="208">This can be seen in patients again and again.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something you can continue.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you place you are worse very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There have been several cancer spots in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again subsequently went six Chemotherapiezyklen Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="220">No trace of the tumours is now more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding.</seg>
<seg id="222">They need that money - think of practical things, for example, or my wife, show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works if I am.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you get bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">They have to look to the future.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 14, 16, and Tamsin, this is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is difficult for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls, a disease that I have, I will not grow old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted quite differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very gesellig and ungestüm.</seg>
<seg id="231">They told their friends and we got very soon many telephone calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was restrained.</seg>

<seg id="234">Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are redolent of hope, not a trace of hope of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease is (as, ultimately, also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong's electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach is probably the long feeds the protests in Hong Kong Geschäftsbezirk, began in the space of a few hours after the announcement during activists planning and mobilisation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is no surprise, but it makes us angry, ``said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what was promised to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have lied to the residents of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In its defence of the Chinese decision said Li R & D & I, Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the licensing of public nominations' chaotic'for the Hong Kong Government in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a new clause should also be allowed only'candidates with love for the country and love to Hong Kong'.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">For the demonstration of the organisers said that their movement reached a new level of civil disobedience, and they were in the coming weeks, wave of protest.</seg>
<seg id="17">They gave no details, however, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort, an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted, and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen today and the occupation of Zentralbezirks will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared on the announcement of Beijing for days, and it was on the Sunday before the government buildings more stringent security measures, including police forces and the barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest that they are losing control of their city, many in Hong Kong by the feeling.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the demonstrations of Occupy-Central-movement, because they are the affiliated - the lifeline of Hong Kong - compromises.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, which they say, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert regime Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want any fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, an unofficial referendum organised activists to voting rights on which 780.000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenagers at the beginning of this month, was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants were their hands in the air, and not, as they were before the funeral, shoot, 'hands.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience set white feminist commentators to raise before the race, when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and salary inequality sex.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions in the Near West, rose and throughout the country attention received Perez, saw that the answers from white women to 100% of the race:.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez meant that an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">I do not believe that the feminism, many people take place, which will be on the white and privileges in high-grade type, ``she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people have to say something to the events.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson problems to light those black Amerikanerinnen face every day, are regarded as' women'in the cultural area but not.</seg>
<seg id="13">``I can publish something lustiges on Facebook on me and my partner and get 150 Likes from anywhere, ''said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Studied in the history of the United States for black women as Mitchell, the race, gender and sexuality, there are no dichotomy between races and Geschlechterproblemen.</seg>
<seg id="17">For you have black women had the luxury to separate clean the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women, the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen, says Angela Hattery, professor for women and'subdivision of the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">``from 1865 and in 1890, at least 10 000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always the rape of a white woman, ''said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story, in order to justify the Lynch murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">You took the decision to stand up for the right of women to vote and the right to vote for Black should come later, ``said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If we look at such things, why is a coloured women white women dare not aware of power.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done our job well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">After 1920 women the right to vote, it took a decade until white women against the lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "trapping" played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Would it, if the activists, such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to not great Empfängniskontrolle? ``asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second-generation feminists, who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and pithy though published an article by Rebecca Carroll, Kolumnistin the Guardian newspaper in which they more protests from white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem in a rather intersektionalen feminism is referred to as Geschlechterthemen as well - in the races, some surprises for Rassenthema in America of their comments.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole feminism?" Said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems to Ferguson's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are hundreds of specific programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently, a small programme, My Brother's auflegte, thereby helping young black men and hispanischen vulnerable, there was irritating reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police to the black Community is not the only issue that is at the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest border this year, is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">These speak for themselves, ``said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants, the women who accompany them, are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find an echo in the women's organisations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed</seg>
<seg id="2">A British woman says she thought that they would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers lived almost its entire youth in the belief that they are only a few years after they had been diagnosed with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was indeed Charcot-Marie-tooth disease (CMT) - a group ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK said that false diagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT, because so little is known about the disease.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23.000 people in Britain are likely to lead to the CMT, motor disorders such as Muskelschwäche, an uncertain and gekrümmten Zehen.</seg>
<seg id="7">Ill also suffer from numbness or pain, and the disease is progressive and incurable, which means that by the time the symptoms get worse.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Rodgers 13, it was believed that they Friedreich's ataxia (IAs) have - a disease with very poor survival.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair, before they were 18, and die before their 30th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.</seg>
<seg id="11">I fell steadily and it took longer for me.</seg>
<seg id="12">I could never go with the other children skating or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and run gehänselt.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said that they realised their medical records at the age of 13 years after several operations to the discharge of their Achilles and stretching their legs, when her doctor had left the room and read that they suffered from IAs.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home and was looking for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA-society," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">I received a reply, I was shocked and got terribly in panic.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought that I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and 25 die, and lose all my skills would slowly in between.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was all alone with me and planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said that when she was 17, it was clear that their skills had not fallen as much as they had imagined and questioned their doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">He stood up and took me and said, 'I love, I do not believe that you would have otherwise you already in the wheelchair'.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax burden of businessmen in Washington, with the economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">The recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week, and the companies in the Washington area, according to a newly published study were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the area of District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27,6 billion dollars to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared with the revenue from 2012 to the tune of $600 billion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of businesses rose last year by 4.3% to EUR 671 million, compared to 3.9% in the year before, and it was the third consecutive Wachstumsjahr after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes increased more than the local taxes, 4.3%, so the study carried out by the National Centre for taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe from Dienstleistungsagentur Ernst & Young.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the District, 56%, revenue comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Mary's revenues come from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses, with 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large proportion of the increase in revenue is founded the company in a recovery of Immobilienwerte, researchers, leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern by 3.7% this year for the three successive years with a growth rate of less than 1%.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits for large states like California, New York and Texas, is of course also applies to the area of Washington.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.</seg>
<seg id="15">On 509.719 '490.305, 28.872 in Maryland 419.306 is the following: a large part of the property, 381.955 352.001, 70.352, 58.838, particularly in the field of taxation on 28.261 to DC is either 267.811, 128.668, 61.645, 40.822 on 17.375 in possession of the government or 14.597 of non-profit organisations, the pay on 14.334 57.539 not Immobiliensteuern on 29.285, ``said on 113.582, 26.995, Douglas Lindholm, 81.218, managers for the 49.154, Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Unternehmenseinnahmen seem to recover the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported income taxes in Staatsorganisationen of 2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue from 4.1%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three with 6 percent in all three areas, there are strong business rates).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study at the beginning of this year, the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study of the District was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages, Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the government continues to his Einkommensziele next year, could reduce this law by 2017 up to 3% of the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz of the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, there seems to be better off small businesses in Washington, and they are therefore more state and local taxes, as the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a Übergangsstruktur, organised under the most small businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% in the last year to EUR 2.4 billion dollars, a faster rate than the taxation as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year, with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region, the Washington area could lag behind.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed, as reported information on Monday morning: the online retailers and Videoproduzent, and a number of other things, buy the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million US $).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement is not surprising, because no one expects a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube buy the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google's video service for a cool billion. The cooperation also appeared, of course.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch it was founded as a Justin.tv only three years ago, was a Live-version of YouTube - launched as a general Streamingdienst.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it was' a platform for players, who published their Bravourstücke in games, a'YouTube for live games, so an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a video genre, in the opinion of the (mostly older) games give a veneer of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is precisely that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors.</seg>
<seg id="10">A mystery to me why the deal with YouTube did not come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as it is Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer, President of this statement: "We have decided on Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport, it is difficult to understand the attraction, the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">All of these games, you could see it now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today, so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the quick passes, all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as not a game or Humorvirtuose is Twitch-channel is probably not so very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what sceptics as I know it?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called of 55 million of visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen.</seg>
<seg id="21">And exactly how to make money from Amazon?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video, such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something that each company would like: Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of Twitch, shear, said, 'both Twitch Amazon and believe in the future of the Gaming, ``and the medium shows no signs of contraction, not even - Schluck - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="10">It was already early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air respect encouragement.</seg>

<seg id="22">There were more people than expected, ``said Ron Sem, was a success at the line ''.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a repeat of the major party in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although in content and size of the events work still needs to be made in a first assessment Sem on Sunday with the Volksstimme.</seg>
<seg id="25">As he described, in that, in the meantime, had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result: some people who had already paid, were no longer on the premises.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response has been very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler involved in organising of around 1 200 visitors in the Burggarten tummelten.</seg>
<seg id="30">There have been problems with the sound.</seg>

<seg id="35">The premiere of Amula-Open-Air was more of the visitor numbers as successful.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organisers have some mistakes, which will be forgiven for the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">The organizers also have criticism in the social network Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for 12 euros, you simply expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Unfortunately, ye assumed a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.</seg>

<seg id="6">Seemed very diverse the positions, as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be tackled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now to move between the two camps: it should soon be held talks on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (and friends) on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">``I have called Mr Piffl and that we could get together once again proposed'Sjöberg reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">So are made visible progress more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests, the "development and Erlebbarmachung" for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain.</seg>

<seg id="24">The different positions in terms of reconstruction will remain in next time Piffls in the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="25">It recognises Dimbath as' missionary ', always to the reconstruction of the castle was thought.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">By a large part of the population, as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.</seg>
<seg id="29">But over time, I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project. "We could create a" unique selling point "for the raftsmen city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here, there is nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the project by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy." He hope that the club at this point might make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal, first to document the history, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clever ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the costs for university textbooks for many students are more than 1, 000 dollars per year, considered the fast-Zweitsemesterstudent little Schroeder a smart Sparidee.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a Leihsystem for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the Rückverkauf.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the last semester needed books would cost $430 him, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Collegeleitung told that students, however, several Kostendämpfungsoptionen, spending on textbooks and Studienmaterial the students per year on average more than 1 200 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online shops and creative approaches, such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than at the time of purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books was hired last spring semester in college bookstores, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books are bought in campuses-bookshops, according to the National Association of college Handelsvereinigung stores.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the ABC for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books online costs only a third of the price for which they have in the campus-bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook retailer for 239,99 $.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy used</seg>
<seg id="18">If one of the notes of other or normal Gebrauchsspuren nothing, secondhand books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is needed in Chegg.com for 93,49 $.</seg>
<seg id="20">Little Casaday, 25, Abschlussstudent of Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of'Strategic Media Decisions: understanding, The Business End Of The Advertising Business ``.</seg>
<seg id="21">The book has been sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students, whether the previous expenditure are acceptable to ask their professors.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, elderly spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">No Chegg and Amazon is also Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for secondhand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rents</seg>
<seg id="27">If you are reasonably good and they give you the books after the conclusion of the exchange rate will not want to remember the rents of textbooks is worth.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchases.</seg>
<seg id="29">A student could rent for about 20 dollars for the duration of six months' Calculus', for example.</seg>
<seg id="30">Learn more about the terms of the transaction in which you rent, including on the criminal charges, the case for the writing of notes, underscores or use traces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tenants beware: If you don't return the book, the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-Books</seg>
<seg id="33">E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes these books are de facto rented by an electronic license will be provided by large retailers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, Barnes & Noble Inc. for a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="35">Chegg can rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics today can be downloaded for free, while scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">In any case, around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the PEPPER dine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the provision of prices for books, because you can be sure to find the right textbook.</seg>
<seg id="39">And in an online order remains to be seen, so Gault, whether the book is actually stock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin calls for the inclusion of "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine from Kiev</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow that Putin was not meant to have that under the control of the separatists of the field of wrote a part of Russia, will later on, but that its status for Ukraine should be redefined to give to the representation of the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region of power.</seg>
<seg id="4">On 730.624, 155.291 69.341, Putin's call on the Government to Kiewer 25.879 to negotiations on 24.565 47.904 on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits 296.494 186.928, on to the 153, 128.558, 15.553 by him on the 62.558 91.506 since the riots on 33.949, five months seems to be persecuted strategy: aid 81.179 15.719) for the separatists 17.268 on the adoption of the 43.888 36.312, areas and pressure on 106.259 on the Ukrainian Government, Novorossija on 37.968 15.823, the newly proclaimed region on 55.663, 76.244, de facto independence 48.153 for an alliance with Russia on third 29.156 with the West will sector.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television channel One, Putin the Ukrainian Militärkampagne to recapture the separatist nature areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Lugansk, which was adopted in March and April, after Moscow Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March annexed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as "Novo Rossija" or "New Russia," a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks "trapped in their illusions," Itar-TASS reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin's reference to be seen with the greater autonomy in the context of the rule of law must be discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months that the cultural and linguistic rights threatens to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian Government is the eastern areas give the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but' in Ukraine an internal conflict.</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that was raised at international forums of Russian diplomats, would the regional governments to negotiate its own trade agreements and external relations, power in Ukraine, and so the Kremlin de facto the Russian territory in the Crimea, the control over an area.</seg>
<seg id="15">The five months annexed Peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important Handelshafen and historical coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections - additions to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas have greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the idea of autonomy is in stark contrast to the arming and incitement to stand accused of Moscow, the Kremlin and the separatist rebel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup, according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, the between Nowoasowsk and access to the narrow peninsula Crimea, Mariupol is to build a Stahlindustriehafen with 500 000 inhabitants, launched a massive civil and military preparations.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leaders in Brussels and has asked for urgent action to prevent against Ukraine another Russian aggression, a former Soviet republic, the last 23 years of independence.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are just at the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit, no concrete actions, the leadership was the proposal further sanctions against Russia, which will enter into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukrainekrise.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the besieged separatists, said Col.
