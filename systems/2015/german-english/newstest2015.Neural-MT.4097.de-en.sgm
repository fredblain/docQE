<seg id="1">Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As trade unions die, the Mittelklassejobs," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice president of the Progressive Caucus Congress in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I proudly present the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of the national anti-discrimination law, in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against vulnerable workers, in order to sue a civil court in order to sue justice - and to obtain compensation or compensation - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggests is the connection back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once again encouraged countries all over the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time when millions of Americans still remember this country, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that 'the rights of workers in association and common negotiation and action are guaranteed.'</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism Adolf Hitler replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly the: "The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve the labour and economic conditions of each individual and every profession or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which was drawn up by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors have a guarantee that 'everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect their interests or to join them.'</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans have been forced to accept that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country consulted other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government authorities - must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">With these rights in America under attack, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labor movement has not reduced the strength of the nation, but increased it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable increase.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History reminds us, and we should do so.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judges are temporarily stopping to force all Abtreibungskliniken in Louisiana to close down.</seg>
<seg id="2">A the stopped on Sunday provisionally the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five Abtreibungskliniken of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to enter into force on 1 January, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a Patientenaufnahmerecht at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles for their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while they are requesting such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law, while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote federal John deGravelles in his judgment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within a month, a hearing will be set for judges to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abtreibungsbefürworter welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors have so more time to obtain Krankenhauseinweisungsrechte.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a treacherous law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chair of the Center for reproductive rights lodged in the name of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for Einweisungsrechte.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not.</seg>
<seg id="11">key of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close down, were stopped by a federal on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abtreibungsbefürworter and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, are saying that doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="13">abortion believe that measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has Patienteineinweiserechte, divided the center for reproductive rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortions, this doctor would no longer be able to carry out the operation, as the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not penalize doctors for the execution of abortions, whereas their applications would still be pending.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to be the result of a political battle against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the time of the vote on Sunday, the NPD had failed spectacularly.</seg>
<seg id="7">A first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure in 2003, because, at that time, the Görus was also in the hands of informers.</seg>
<seg id="8">In December 2013, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an opinion on the new press, he contradicts statements by the executive director Peer Medau and attested to this "as a Feldherr."</seg>
<seg id="2">The style of the university is not, that is, in the communication.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, the family family had already been informed of the request of the university in the middle of June.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong, "says so.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, it points out that the plans are not 'Vorfestlegungen or even decisions', but there are 'preferences'.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also, the extension of the narrow road to the entrance to the castle is less dramatic than that of the Medaus.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was from a nine metre wide road and is not mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="8">It goes to the current state at 5.50 metres, which is a metre wide than before, "explains Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="9">The argument of the Medau-Betreiber, that their free and inquire parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university, does not want to apply Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="10">Zugeparkt is not at all because, as with other public car parks, it has become an intelligent solution.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thinking to the People " s Villages</seg>
<seg id="12">The nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and, in front of its door, would have access to the parking deck, should not be affected by the "Hochschulpräsidenten."</seg>
<seg id="13">Instead, he has to bear in mind that this is not only about the crèche, but also about the residents at the entrance to the transition and the 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school.</seg>
<seg id="14">So it is a question of much more than the special interests of Mr Medau, " says Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whether the critique of the Elternbeirats of the crèche, with the expansion of the road would be lost to a "the few natural stains of Coburgs," the reader can decide for himself ."</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the town councils about the constructional development of the University of Applied Sciences by 2020 and to address the importance of new development in this context.</seg>
<seg id="17">Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">As a result, access to the new parking deck is not going to take place via the Campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the campus.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this way, the narrow road should be extended to approximately one kilometre length.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to the estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss castle would increase tenfold.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.</seg>

<seg id="23">I must also say that, after my long hospitalization in 2012, I have become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Has never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family of a immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died as Henry 19, worked in a factory and its relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry worked for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which was partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born from the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente.</seg>
<seg id="8">He attended "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was difficult to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">One never seen his face, heard only his voice: "Listen to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Join us!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to see cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the re-fills or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Much of my life was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into how life had been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now slightly brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian labyrinth with Flammenstößen and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father used to be simply in the tub and then he was able to hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I woke up there, it became clear to me that he had done so for years to put food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry, as a child, grew up without his parents " the.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when my mother died at the end of her life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love you."</seg>
<seg id="24">With his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have you ever stopped with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Listen to me to hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I am 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">with Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still with French friends, with whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry " s own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I was very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said "You must be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I pulled this Fitnessding and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="41">No-one likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry professional may be seen in his elegant, kurzgeschnittenen.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It followed the comedy of the errors, and then fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitation and wrote to New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His career began in the middle of the seventies, "I was for a fairly long time the only black singers / comedian on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to learn not only in front of the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine, while I was a star on television, and that was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 at New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the Bühnenrecht at the Black and White minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people "black anmalten," Henry made his comedy there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family was very uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="54">I just wish that it would never happen, but I do not regret that I have done it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on the and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this "years light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">As a result of the introduction of figures depicting British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative Comedykreis in the Eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of the Lenny Henry Show took place in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the head chef Gareth Blacklock in the series boss.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles have influenced his next decade, but after his left LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you just have the time to sit around or play a bit on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then came a Documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never learned anything about him in school and kept him mostly for a domain of the middle class, white in pantyhose and a cabbage front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had great fear of it.</seg>
<seg id="65">All who we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't be bad if you don't know what you're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Take a few words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry introduced 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I was able to do that.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on the head.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Therefore it is, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learning your text, works a bit.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash, and this simply did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn " t believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed you."</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to talk to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice told me" you have to bridge 10 minutes while you fix the computer ."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the Bühnenleiter announced that the idea was order as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, so keep in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Learning the text for fences was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was also a good thing, so it is like a great sign of the gods that tell me "this is your destiny."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, with a DONNERNDEN voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I stand by it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a sample.</seg>
<seg id="93">However, Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts while he continues to imitate people.</seg>
<seg id="94">I decided not to make first because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of stranger is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you are looking for what you are looking for, you are driving a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes run live in the Apollo, if I want to do so, but as a whole I do not have as much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I would like to ask him whether he will ever again make a Stand-up-Comedytour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up again.</seg>
<seg id="99">So is this new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think.</seg>
<seg id="101">I would like an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It is fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">One always tells a story, and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="24">In order to avoid a demotion in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Soell moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>

<seg id="2">She meets with a proud Ruhmesschleppe from the banking world, the Institute and the inner circle of the Party.</seg>

<seg id="4">Her career began with the world " s masses Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world of's.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned as the primary post of the parent company's to a younger male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their compensation was supposedly nearly £1 million.</seg>

<seg id="8">She was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the Cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory member of the Council.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">Confidence works in two directions: inward to the first guard of its own Managementhierarchie in the BBC, but also to the outside as a voice of public concern and restlessness when things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This provides for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires full reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the newly incoming president would risk taking action, on everything, and an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may be doing his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if that were not enough, many people are still interested in seeing the BBC shrunk - power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While competition is approaching and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is fraught with particular dangers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145,50 a year, the British public is buying the largest media company in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC is telling a good story: it says that it reaches 96% of all households, costing each of them only 40 pence per day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And it seems that the BBC is rising again at the top: 53% support it today, compared to 31% 10 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a belittling remark about the democratic Bezirksstaatsanwältin, which is at the heart of a criminal offense against him because of abuse of authority.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another of the Perry user account, the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not accept the tweet and have deleted it," said it in the later news.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mr Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets of Perry have been the official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the previous Tweet, a two image of the Bezirksstaatsanwältin of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drink-driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry put a veto against financial support for their offices, as they refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry - which could be a presidential candidate for 2016 - before a Grand Jury held this month in Austin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The text of the tweets reads: "I am not always drunk with the triple permissible permitted... but if I do it, I accuse Mr Perry when he ausplaudert it."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the betrunkenste in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Lehmbergs's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was led by Michael McCrum, a prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry is not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.</seg>
<seg id="15">His illustrious team of lawyers applied in the case of the judge who was responsible for the prosecution and argued that the law dealing with the longest-serving governor in the history of the State of Texas is diffuse.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry stopped 7.5 million $public funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state, based in Travis County, and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas, as Lehmberg refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a public complaint.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.</seg>
<seg id="19">After graduating from the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry went to speculation that he will stop by making a tweet of a photograph of himself near a lake x11, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"</seg>

<seg id="2">One of London " s most prominent architects pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned to normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were hot demand and the subject of huge price increases, which led the Bank of England, owing to widespread fear of a credit bubble, to set limits on mortgage credit in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the start of the current Finanzjahrs the market has returned to normal Transaktionsniveaus since the peak of 2013" and added that this is a "stable Handlungsumgebung."</seg>
<seg id="5">The real-estate market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information from the Katasteramts, the prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5% last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling prices at Berkeleys private, cheap and student offers increased by about one-fifth in the past year and at the end of April around the 423.000 £.</seg>
<seg id="8">Over the past few months, however, a stronger pound has made less attractive in London for foreign buyers - some of them have been deterred by the introduction of new Immobiliensteuern and political rhetoric about a possible "Villensteuer" before the general elections next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that, in the second half of the year, the Hypothekenmarktbericht, in the second half of the year, would lead to a reduction in market growth, both at the property and at the prices.</seg>

<seg id="12">The transaction in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, is now a quarter of a quarter, so the broker WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the amounts due to due amount to more than $2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well planned product at the best sites remained stable and as a result the Terminverkäufe remained stable."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than at the peak of 2007 before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual earnings growth increased by 40% to 280 million per year, sales by 18% to 1.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a communication on Monday before the company's Annual General Meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year is likely to correspond to the current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysts estimate the annual budget increase to EUR 450 million.</seg>

<seg id="2">They were zerflossen, so it was best to describe them, they were slowly moving on like a carton that was left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Occasionally he said a woman that he was too serious, tiring, intensive, distanced himself, and perhaps a little bit from.</seg>
<seg id="4">And he shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He knew he was.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was the, as in hedgehog, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last casualty of this Stacheligkeit was a recent affair, which was more promising to ease the solitary boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even a certain satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn where was a Mount-Trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was accompanied by an older accompaniment to the south, who held Kevern for her aunt, and who inherited a land in a humid but paradisiacal valley with the proper name Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">No one had lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were leak, in the baths were still spiders, nudibranchs had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant Elin.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like the house of a children, both menacing and seductive, a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, the novel "J" on the posthumously for the It Award 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had been sitting in high grass and had an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag with Ailinn published in the broken in, who provided the land with soothing music and soothing messages, as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer that his father liked to listen to closed shutters in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to their innate aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was properly banned - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been successfully obsolesziert, as the word obsoleszieren.</seg>
<seg id="20">The general taste, which decrees and rules never managed, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren, cookery and romantic, they chose the ballads in music.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play a imaginary piano and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns great feet to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn did not understand this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a well-known song of a pianists called Roll Waller," he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had been playing with his own father, he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very funny game at the time, and it was not very funny now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that it was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what Jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvisation was no longer modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was only space for a single "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">The people wanted to be very safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is the same mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically fact mind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he was ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he didn " t have to explain that Roll Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">In her age, she probably could not remember a time when singers was not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A conforming society meant that any element of this society would be grateful to the principle of Gruppenbegabung - grateful to the fate of spared.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with afro-karibischer origins were suitable for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran them.</seg>

<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community was concerned about the sewer system; what was left of the Greeks, crushed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENING WAR, IF ES HAPPENING WAR WAR from fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, fearing that the flames would devour them as next - had Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, thought and became depressed.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each one of his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads, it was difficult to understand how the abusive words that Kevern had just had been able to be played.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except for people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge kohlartigen leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why should your father have such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence.</seg>
<seg id="59">She thought, anyway, that he was a little strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It appeared funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">They shook their heads and blocked Keverns.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing else to see on the whole world than her ungekämmtes bleak hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing he would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say," I mean it without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not explain why you vorsingst me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He saw it again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet are not so direct.</seg>
<seg id="70">Maybe your ankles, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?</seg>
<seg id="72">Do you hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is only the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said 'I love you', but it was too early for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think me," he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That sounded wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">It had to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because he, like his father, did not have the soothing charm needed to control the savagery inherent in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn where was red and rose out of her deck-chair, threw the console around and buried the wine she had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Holunderblütenwein, so drunk was not an excuse for him.</seg>
<seg id="86">In their excitation, they seemed to tremble, like palm-branches in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your Dickkopf is precisely why I feel perverted to you," she said...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not.</seg>
<seg id="89">She was sorry, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did they say that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge and icy ocean broke out here as there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with still thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE WAR, who had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from tavern to pub, always willing to raise the hand against a woman who refused or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Dickkopf?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown a thick fist if they were not farewells!</seg>
<seg id="96">You only canoodle - kissing was the most frequently used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous ballads from the console - they only canoodle and then beat.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the kissing itself was already an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn where gave him a sign through her body.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from a deck-chair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She also felt bleiern, but the fury of his grief surprised them.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They did not know.</seg>
<seg id="103">She saw him as he departed - just like a room on the upper floor, her companion to him - a man, complaining through something he had created himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from her, his back, embarrassed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before the day before?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was back alone, Ailinn looked looked on her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Several years before the recent incidents, town Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic VIENNA researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body for public sentiment, gave a short talk about continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence.</seg>
<seg id="109">"It has already been done much, and much still needs to be done," wrote it, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that led a thousand wars, and most of them won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt historically despite the soaring church between hedgerows.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties stand out as ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion that it continues to awaken.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries to hear sentimental ballads, intoxicated in stories about Reinvigorated difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still does not only maintain the former harshness the rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home, at work, on the streets and even on the squares.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest you read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">town Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: are you atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that I do not have to say," replied town walnut.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again, town appealed to her right to privacy and denial of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a labour-intensive workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a unprejudiced society.</seg>
<seg id="125">However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may distort results, as you have presented them.</seg>
<seg id="126">They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call 'deceitful' and 'raw' may be interpreted by others as well as an expression of power and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you continue on the herumreitet, WHAT HAPPENING IST, IF ES HAPPENING IST, as if it had happened yesterday, would mean to take the country its essential vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">town walnut looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head repeated a LED-Schriftzug in Flamingorosa the advice that the had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.</seg>
<seg id="130">smile to their neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, take advantage of your phone, speak your phone, talk to you, tell you, you listen to, you agree, excuse yourself.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand what you want," replied town walnut with a calmer voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing more than that we are not as effective as we are deceiving ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that were made at the very first of the WHAT, IF ES HAPPENING.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time, however, it is not the others in which we forget our anger and our mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz shaped with the hands a pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to indicate a warning message.</seg>
<seg id="137">"They go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as" errors "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.</seg>
<seg id="138">They also go too far, when you say that they have left their "rage" and their "distrust" to "others."</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about the past, such as the protection of the present, not of 'us' and 'other'.</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there was no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"If we are honest with ourselves," durst town release, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">There is no need to say anything more - we are in agreement on this.</seg>
<seg id="147">And, just as no blame must be allocated, it must not be repaid if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to wipe it out.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past serves us to forget them.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something about this, I should like to say something about this.</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz rocked his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed it.</seg>
<seg id="153">On the next day, when she went to work as usual, she was ridden by a motorcyclist who, like passers-by, was in a kind of "brutal fury" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="1">Production in the Eurozone on a 13-Monats-Tief</seg>
<seg id="2">The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months, so a closely observed study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final economics Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50,7 in August, after a stand of first in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">An indication of 50 gives an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders went back and factories were experiencing break-ins at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures take place before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets are expecting a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could do more in the course of this week to consider a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those carried out by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at economics.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, it fell in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI on 46,9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a problem child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Note that stimulus in the Schlüsselindustriemechanismus Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer resort, are also not reassuring, "said Mr. Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of the analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="15">A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI has risen to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, Chefwirtschaftsexperte at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said for the Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry in the euro area of August is that the sector continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously difficult to find life at the moment, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large contracts.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that it is' increasingly likely 'that the ECB should eventually embark on a kind of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="2">Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.</seg>

<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new year, captured and killed, this seemed like the skull of evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy united West and East in revulsion, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="9">We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell is going to haunt them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Your greatest hope?</seg>

<seg id="17">My legs were told.</seg>
<seg id="18">I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier brought them in safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of operations she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.</seg>

<seg id="22">Some shrapnel are still in my knees.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their aim is to become dentist in order to help the people, as they have been helped by doctors.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says tear.</seg>
<seg id="25">"That is what happened to me, and that cannot be changed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I always go into the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too great.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together as we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.</seg>
<seg id="32">I am thinking of a family later.</seg>
<seg id="33">She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of each year will be somewhat weak.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was his first day of school (Russians go to school for 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">As Native he said: "Mom told me, I should lie down when there was an explosion and keep their hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion he thought it would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She said to him: 'Run.'</seg>
<seg id="41">Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a little infant, took it at hand and fled through a bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father, Vladimir, who joined his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: 'I could not save them'.</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara was tripped up outside and with Beinverletzungen in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that their son died.</seg>
<seg id="45">After her reunion she said: "I wept for joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I could not believe.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), to receive from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion.</seg>
<seg id="49">"This horror takes you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">But I can say that it is pale in my memory.</seg>
<seg id="51">I still know that I am using all my once.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these children, with whom I have played in the court, and who have not done it out.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they have been killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they have remained in the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London, especially to the toy, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror takes you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I am sorry to all those who suffer from the barbarities," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I would like to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to go one day to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the Schulungsakademie.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and walk, and this stillness lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She remembers her trip to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">The people of London wept when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful Blair and her Foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and you just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and she wanted to once all local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember, as he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot on her and she ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was only one month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: 'I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">War is now continuing in Ukraine, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are exactly children like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I simply know what these people feel, all the horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can not stop feeling this.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or furious at all.</seg>
<seg id="82">For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know he does not like to remind him, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and ignite candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us turned away, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I still remember, as he did all his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge, Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I woke up after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with all the parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely certain that my little boy in this hell could have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I was Sudanese-born," Damir, Budapest, Budapest ," but I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it and he is away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so the life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.</seg>

<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most emblematic symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a health care professional, had sacked him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son, Vladimir to the University.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three horrible days alone," he remembers.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Sverdlovsk managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date is, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think it is long ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days keep me busy.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.</seg>

<seg id="107">I remember that Sverdlovsk wanted to go to school this day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I just knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this statue of the weeping Sverdlovsk in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Sverdlovsk does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand this, but I also mean that, thanks to this image, people throughout the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Sverdlovsk says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused him?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world will become a little bolder.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so what happens?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years have nothing to do with such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="121">It attacked my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went back to school later in 2004 and had a fear of every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought to my friends and classmates who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That is why I always go into the sports hall when 1 September is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old Kindheitsfreunden.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is difficult for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I am not ashamed.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will be surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was an education in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to become a soldier, but my health was not.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Sverdlovsk Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy who survived, even though he was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Sverdlovsk Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb, which was fastened on the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It really is a miracle that he has not been killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Sverdlovsk, who wanted to go to the FSB, but who could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is not what I left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can " t forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005 - in the year afterward - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never return again and do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">survivor: Sverdlovsk Fanijew today, with a photograph of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop.</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is incredible and I wear it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">I think it is a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now run well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health I was not able to study at the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents, also the medical submission and they have replied that it is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been here for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should not be aware of this and, of course, they should not suffer.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Sverdlovsk will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be much more violent for him, because he was there and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and here in Beslan all of them have been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Sverdlovsk is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to accept that if something is to.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot take part because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He has been operating on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries around the slain.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are these people fighting for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe that.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we can only use all of these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.</seg>

<seg id="192">The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists left them, but in their savagery they kept their 30-year mother, the 10 Sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the sports.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then, and with his new wife Svetlana a little girl named him after his lost daughter Kristina.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="197">"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 Tips for Better pictures and Videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof waterproof, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action-Cam like the A Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I recorded these photos at a family celebration with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Independently of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Control your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other compartments are closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Upload your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene and home, with which the exposure time for the otherwise Unterwasserbedingungen is optimized.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump into it, check the depth of your equipment.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Find in our guide and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Make NC - because many will not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, do not normally not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right Adjustment is a luck.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you make a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a Reihenmodus with which a series of shots will be made with slightly altered exposure, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Remain close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light becomes dramatically worse, the more you remove from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, you will remain close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Go close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is very important for you to work with a Action-Cam: these devices often have a fixed Panasonic, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if you want to complete the whole picture area.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advisory anesthetist, he dedicated his career to spare the sick both the agony of the disease and the agony of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, his wife, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the physicians are important to diagnose and disease, while the treated are mostly preoccupied with something else: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel," he wrote in May this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties with me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he remarked that he was impatient with his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want to do everything better now than later," he recorded.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusually and without reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out his breast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps for skiing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the radiograph was.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the Brustfell skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whereas, for example, some smokers are developing lung cancer, not all smokers have been smokers earlier.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger is a asbestos - contact with the Faserbaustoff, once known as "Wunderstoff."</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous the has been no longer used in Britain since the 1960 " s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to using it no longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial Gefahrstoff from a different age, it seems unlikely to be even more worrying today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-Epidemie.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease than in road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual figures from the since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are seeing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999), is the fact that a mesothelioma is developing only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of the is not confined to former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore, mesothelioma does not know adapted, financial limits, professions or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament buildings are asbestverseucht.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even in hospitals, where we are supposed to be healthy, they have already been identified as Ausgangsherde of this deadly Karzinogens.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he could be in contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found it out.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks like that in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years studying my training, a lot of asbestos was present," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All - students, nurses, doctors and porter - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who were sick in the last five years, he wrote in a letter in 2010," I am the last one who still lives. "</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will become ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">At Andrew Lawson, mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">This was an unusually long period of survival.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of all cancers are dying within 8 months of diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So we can only repeat the Lawson question: 'How many of us will become ill?'</seg>
<seg id="53">Britain " s leading expert in mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that, between 1870 and 2050, when the Asbestepidemie in Britain is expected to come to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease will be the victim.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">A Asbestmine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the people concerned frequently turn for compensation, shows the extent to which the Scourge is already rife.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, were able to expose Janice to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the Kleidungsabteilung at two locations - one of which was the flagship at Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her activity at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in the twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this thing," she said, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't really know anything about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that would affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name derives from the word "Asbestiform," a description of the structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is the most widely used asbestos in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roofing, interiors, Rohrisolationen, Boilerisolierungen, even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than others, but it is still regarded by the EU and the WHO as a 'major health risk' with possible death.</seg>
<seg id="70">However, sunscreen is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world " s largest importer of brown asbestos, and pundits suspect that "it was clear, but indirect evidence, that this was a major cause for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">A staff of Marks & Spencer was suspended at Oxford Street, London, Asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected, stating that "a significant proportion of the mesothelioma, without a known suspension through work or in the House, was probably caused by environmental problems in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as if no one can be sure of being safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the palace of Westminster, shows how people might have been exposed to the substance in the heart of the government.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard reported that the Serviceschächte and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibers could be caused by something as harmless as "strong meta-pattern."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of Parliament are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the directorate of the Parliamentary Committee insisted that the Westminsterpalast have received a 'clean health', it is now undisputed that EUR 1 billion is needed over several years to renovate Parliament, to modernise the electrical installations and to remove asbestos, and that, after the general elections, the Members will be more likely to meet in the near future than on the green benches in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard-Bericht also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions'.</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost.</seg>
<seg id="83">All you can do is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who was never able to determine the contact with asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott predicts that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital in which Asbestklagen was positively decided," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all the places where one has worked and the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got some kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and was carrying out an operation just late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It suddenly came.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt awful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought it was no longer possible to make the trip home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain of Brustfell, the skin around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He did not go to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Verwunderte doctors made X-rays of his breast and put Pleurakathether in order to detect liquid from the lungs and to test them in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health was slow, and he returned to his job.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and intense breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But, even now, Abbott did not do so with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a probe probe was introduced into the cave between the ribs and the Brustfell.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually go on, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">Frankly, I have not had so many concerns.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the skin biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "You told me that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott had meetings with Macmillan-Krankenschwestern, one of which recommended him to become a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where tubes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now developing.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so, mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with Asbestisolierungen in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who moved from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to get in touch with the poisonous substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It is apparent that, over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been chance for patients, but life-threatening for the treatment physicians.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still being removed today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students took their bunsenburner on Asbestmatten.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it concerns not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and spaces due to its fabulous insulating and retardant properties.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, many people have probably had the first Asbestkontakt in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, in thousands of Chemiestunden, students have switched their bunsenburner to Asbestmatten.</seg>
<seg id="128">On the web pages, the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile, so innocent items in our homes, such as interiors or Schuppendächer, have been included in asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It is a Industriegift that is contained in large parts of our real estate," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has been representing Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case was the only contact one affected by an affected woman, the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 " s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be sure how to remove your shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of diagnosis and the knowledge that the disease is incurable is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to go further, but I realized that I was unable to concentrate on what I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was in practice two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and I had to take care of myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not experience another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">The greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was with all the information he had to cope with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor" how long I have? "</seg>
<seg id="143">And there were about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "Well, I will not experience another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was the case. '</seg>
<seg id="146">mesothelioma is especially treacherous because it is our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breathing itself - is causing the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by Asbestkontakt.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of the smallest fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos is stirred and the fibres are inhaled, they can be set in the Brustfell, the skin around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the Brustfell and can trigger re-construction.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with the the asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a Herz-Thorax-Arzt who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital, which was suspected by Andrew Lawson, that it exposed him to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely to be exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the Asbestnadeln reach the tissue, Treasure says, they are pressed from the Atemvorgang to the edge where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is from the very beginning that it is invasive.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options for other cancers do not work well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation is, for example, hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You cannot cut the Brustfell," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You don't get around with the knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is not very good at chemotherapy, "the" effect shows "but not heals.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But at the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients actually live longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a Ein-Mann-Unterstützungs- and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Krebszentrale," he met with calls cheerfully.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis four years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally, Abbott " s six Chemotherapiezyklen were offered, which lasted for four months, and his life is likely to be extended only by one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to keep things in a slightly more positive light. "</seg>
<seg id="176">After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, Herz-Thorax-Spezialist on Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage by not having to be referred, I just shouted and got an appointment," there is Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to have a bank transfer and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial in order to be able to take advantage of the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments inevitably fail, many people are affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families that they leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what has changed in the 1960 " s is that it was recognized that even a very small burden was a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital put their case in the end, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation," because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to a Asbestkontakt on Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for Guy's, however, confirmed that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, it is a huge problem for those who are seeking compensation, a huge problem, the lethal Asbestkontakt of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">insurance can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response to this, there have been clear new legislation this year, which makes it easier for Mesotheliom-Betroffene to claim compensation even if their former employers are no longer able to find them.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has established a fund of EUR 350 million donated by the insurance industry, which has been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but can not sue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court in a normal Schadensersatzprozess could have been able to give them - about 120,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="197">Approximately 300 successful applications are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many Mesotheliom-Betroffene, that 350 million pounds have been a "very good work" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not been ignored and the companies could find them and sue them.</seg>
<seg id="200">Mike Penning, then and Pensionsminister, also admitted that the law was not perfect.</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan have said that, in the face of seven fatalities, rapid action is needed on a daily basis.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are suffering so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At that time, Graham Abbott has been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After her first deliberation, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expects to have a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied by a radiotherapy therapy and chemotherapy - a therapy, with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40% over five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt stronger.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">This can be seen again and again in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something you can go on.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you software, you'll get very quickly worse.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he had the last of the six Chemotherapiezyklen.</seg>
<seg id="213">Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several Krebs-Flecken around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">That is lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again, Abbott underwent six Chemotherapiezyklen.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now no trace of tumors is visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and psychologically very demanding.</seg>
<seg id="222">They need to think about practical things - about the money, if I am not more, for example, or my wife show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">They must look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father of modeling, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"For parents, this is difficult," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girl that I would have a disease with which I would not become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted quite differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">modeling was more restrained.</seg>
<seg id="233">She did not say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such discussions are something that all cancer patients need to go through.</seg>
<seg id="235">But, for Mesotheliomerkrankte, such talks are not driven by hope, not by a trail of hope for survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease (as in the end also for Stephen Jay Gould) is a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denies Hong Kong " s right to Regierungswahl, protesters swear retaliation.</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably spurred the long announced protests in Hong Kong " s business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People " s Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all not candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said or Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">People have lied to the residents of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of China " s decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People " s Congress, said that admission of public nominations in the elections to the Hong Kong government would be too messy.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed over China " s control over Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also makes it clear that China " s leaders remain firmly in the hands of a tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to a new clause, only candidates, with love for the country and love for Hong Kong, are to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most violent protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for a number of years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial sector if Beijing does not permit a genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anhängern were gathered in Hong Kong in a few hours after the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned them in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a Online-Mitteilung, the organizers shared that the movement "the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only had to be considered as last resort, an action that will only take place if all Dialogchancen are exhausted and no other choice exists.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen have been exhausted today and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and it was on Sunday before the government building tightened security measures, including police forces and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is accentuated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is also growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticised the demonstrations demonstrations, because they risked the business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests they speak could cause major economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue," said or Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China " s state-controlled media also recently reported about Hong Kong " s activists in Hong Kong as a Western subversive agent.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the rights, in which 780,000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest Demokratiedemonstrationen in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize race and Polizeiverhalten</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they waited before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After three-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the playing white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to raising income and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, while tensions in the Middle West have increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% around the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the suppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, this meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not think that in feminism there is a lot of people who speak about the white and the privileges in such a high-class way," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt compelled to say something about the events.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express this.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson " s problems have come to light that black women are exposed every day, but they are not considered as "women's issues" in the cultural space.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something about how blacks are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell, the race, sex, and sexuality in the history of the US, there is no dichotomy between racial and Geschlechterproblemen.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes neatly; they live in the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now associate the subjects of race and gender in feminist Mainstreamkreisen, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in history to justify the flair.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century and discovered that the fight for electoral law could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They met the decision to stand up for women's rights, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">When you are reminded of such things, one with power is aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We did not do our job well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to compete against the C in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help of black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell is the spate of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists were "catching" with the problems faced by black women for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to Empfängniskontrolle?" asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, 11636 of Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand one of the body's inherent danger - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public opinion - will lead to change," wrote Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for a rather intersektionalen feminism, to be addressed in the race, as well as Geschlechterthemen, some of her comments about the grounds in America are perplexed.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommer, Researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole cyberfeminsm?" said to The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, LSD, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were irritating reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US-Grenzpolizei almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o of the country this year, the theme of the reform is coming back to the surface - this time as a women.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, IESG of We the Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the reform, said that for a reconsidered of the subject as an essential women they only need to publish the stories of the women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of immigrant workers go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories find an echo in women's organisations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leonidas asked for the gladiatorial</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only the gladiators were knöcheltief in the mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag in the amusement park.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumn cold and were completely overwhelmed by the historical spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a colourful parade of performances, performances, games, exhibits and information about the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the warlike Kämpfertruppe of the once "Amor Mortis," which used every Regenpause to demonstrate their robust Kampfeskunst in the soft arena.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gladiatorenbesitzer "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and expert II and sent his men in the ring to the heroic duel in various Gladiatorengattungen.</seg>
<seg id="7">First were the "Provocatoren" in the series with Rechteckschild and the and career on the left leg and Armschiene on the right arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, the and Wurflanze as well as iron Gladiatorenhelm, leg and Armguard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius," which took place with Wurfnetz, tridents and dagger against the "Secutor."</seg>
<seg id="10">As temples metallic the swords, the shields hand-bells and the Wurflanzen flew surrend through the arena, that a fear and anxiety could become the health of the gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="11">But on the one hand the impressive "All," the muscular umpire, an always attentive eye.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and to experience the culture of Roman times," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal," the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation, the theme park for a day became a "Oppidum," a Roman city, such as Plevný Claus Wehage in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.</seg>
<seg id="15">Remains of it were also visible at the Römertag, about "Aquädukt-Marmor" from the eleven meter high and 1400 meters long Römerkanal-Brücke, which stood at Lüftelberg.</seg>

<seg id="5">The harvest rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added the region.</seg>
<seg id="6">Some international companies are already distancing themselves.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Ebola is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic," judge by the head of the African Development Bank, Donald fragile-state.</seg>
<seg id="8">Liberia is the hardest hit</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia " s capital city.</seg>
<seg id="10">On the market only, who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, on its own, the fever fell victim to more than 600 people.</seg>
<seg id="12">Recently, health officials said that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.</seg>

<seg id="26">At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage the environment - with far-reaching consequences.</seg>
<seg id="27">The biggest danger is that international companies shun the area for a long time, says Philippe Bibliografia of the French Think Tank Iris.</seg>
<seg id="28">What is important is how far and how long the virus will spread.</seg>
<seg id="29">In the case of investors, the impression is that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest, "warns Bibliografia.</seg>

<seg id="1">Taxation of businessmen in the space of Washington is rising with economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local authority for business in the country grew slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia have paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue from 2012 to $26.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of business increased by 4.3 percent to 671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the service Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the country " s tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of revenues come from companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28%, generates the lowest tax revenue from companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the increase in tax revenues is justified in a recovery of corporate profits, say the researchers, which led to an increase of 3.7 by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of these profits from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also appears to be the case for Washington.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia have paid more than $10 billion in government and local Immobiliensteuern last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery at the property in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue, as the US economy is in excess of more than one-fifth of corporate profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Businesses in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland, the following: a large part of real estate, especially in the frontier area around DC, is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that other countries offer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in tax revenues by businesses cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported about income taxes of $2.3 billion, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the trend moves in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not grow evenly across all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The road in the district corresponded with 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a subpar tax revenue of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia, with 6% in all three Amtsbereichen, has the least Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern (in all three there are fixed rates).</seg>
<seg id="25">The Unternehmenssteuersatz in Maryland stands at Dura-Flange percent and in the district at relatively high Sullivan percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local business taxes are required, and a better environment than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study the district was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate-tax rate this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to reach its Einkommensziele in the coming year, this law could reduce the state " s state monopoly by up to 3% by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the area of Washington, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, so the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes, which are paid as a personal income tax by small businessmen - a institutions, after which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in overall government spending for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless, the space of Washington could lag behind if the federal government " s fiscal retrenchment has an impact on the labor market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">town: German beer for Guangzhou</seg>
<seg id="2">Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.</seg>
<seg id="3">German beer has an excellent reputation in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankfurt " s twin sister in China now wants a brewery, and is also hoping for a Flug-Direktverbindung between the two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vize-Parteisekretär of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a the in his city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Time and again, the official official of China " s ruling Communist Party came back in the course of the call to address this concern.</seg>
<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is also called the canton in Germany, is one of China " s richest cities,, Li.</seg>
<seg id="9">That is why people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessen Platzeck Thorsten Paparazzi, who led the German Politikerdelegation, said to the host that he will become a partner in Germany after a possible partner for the project.</seg>
<seg id="11">"For beer it does not need much: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">This joie de vivre is already in the hands of Mr. Li, he flatter the host.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, the official official from Guangzhou with Paparazzi, but with a red wine that was served to eat.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tsingtao-Bier is brewed according to German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More commercial transactions</seg>
<seg id="17">A second wish of the Chinese host would be a Flug-Direktverbindung between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">'It would be worthwhile', the local councillors were convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The business dealings between our two cities continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="21">At the moment, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, sued Li.</seg>
<seg id="22">The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for flights.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is a very good idea," replied Paparazzi - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded approvingly.</seg>
<seg id="25">Neat partnership</seg>
<seg id="26">The portico-ed Vize-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this role.</seg>
<seg id="28">He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted as a result of corruption charges.</seg>
<seg id="29">The local leader, Wan Wan, also had to go.</seg>
<seg id="30">The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being rigorously enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.</seg>
<seg id="31">The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked in front of his the for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before joining Guangzhou, he worked as a propaganda in Fujian, where the VW Beetle built a large factory.</seg>
<seg id="33">Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town-twinning activities.</seg>
<seg id="34">The connection to the Guangzhou remote is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the Sino-German connection was celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="36">The China metropolis on the Dynasty is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic clout.</seg>
<seg id="37">Next year they want to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys minutes for $1.04 billion.</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON confirmed what was reported on Monday morning: The online - and the, and a lot of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst minutes for $1.04 billion ($970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of minutes, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as though the sale of minutes to the Google blog of Google for a cool billion was decided, and cooperation also seemed natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">minutes, which was founded only three years ago as broadcasting, was launched as a general Streamingdienst - a version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their favorite games in games, a "Youtube for live games," so an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch-Schnittstelle.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a Videogenre, in which knowing-better (mostly older) games give a painting of Geheimwissenschaftstheater, are already very popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe minutes, so the news that YouTube minutes wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook of an established Technikunternehmens that buys a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not materialise, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we know at the moment is this statement by Fusion-Band belonging, president of minutes: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of minutes.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me who say that they prefer to ride sports than watching it, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching other games instead of taking the Kontrollkonsole into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a Spinner as he shot 20 times in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">You could see all these games right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-Spiele, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the Blickperspektive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the sweeps, in which the Roger Bannisters of our Elektronikzeitalters play all the games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as it is not a game or video game, its Twitch-Kanal is probably not so interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what are sceptics like me already?</seg>
<seg id="20">minutes is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that minutes will be integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, such as YouTube minutes could easily swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But minutes has something that every company would have liked: thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of minutes, belonging, said, Amazon and minutes "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not yet - schluck - as sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On Saturday evening there was a lot of things going on in the Burggartenfest.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organisers agreed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the strong downpours on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-Fest in the road.</seg>
<seg id="4">Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel l light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler road is supposed to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening through various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and the fun comes anyway alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was already apparent at the early Saturday when the first visitors to the Open Air whereas.</seg>
<seg id="11">A feast for all generations had promised the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that is what they have been able to do.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the Versorgungsstände on the Burggartenwiese there were Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearby and further surrounding.</seg>
<seg id="14">They followed the first live performances, wippten with the foot in the clock, enjoyed cool drinks - short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were required.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this across generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While there is a ceiling on the extra white sand at the beach bar lümmelten, others in a quarter of wine in the Vinothek labten, the offspring of the bouncy, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even with the painting, the volunteers in the truest sense of the word had to do their hands full, to get the crowds and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The larger ones used the Wider or participated in a Skateboard-Workshop, which the the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 5.30 pm he down to the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop this.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why a repeat of the big party next year is not forthcoming.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although it still needs to be worked on the content and size of the event, it was clear in a first record on Sunday to the Volksstimme.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a nuisance, he said that the admission had to be stopped in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="26">Apparently the security had been booked with too little force.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result, some people who had already paid no longer came to the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first tentative estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors spoke in the road thronged.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound equipment.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler blocks blocks' n 'Rox, therefore, broke out enervated.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a puncture.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In the next year they will be there," so the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of the Amula-Open-Airs was more than successful in the number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers have made a number of mistakes that will still be forgiven for the first time, but have to be eliminated in the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also in the social network of Facebook, the organizer must be criticized.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve Euro you just want to be expected more," Melanie Meier will say on the events page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have taken a bit of it," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not look very closely at the initial problems.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is very good that some people are not just stupid, but actually trying to put something on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">Beware, "writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.</seg>
<seg id="44">It is now a year for the organisers to put a stop to these criticisms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Will the Burgvereine again be pulling in the same direction?</seg>
<seg id="2">Last but not least, there was a dispute between the two warring factions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, took the project in the French Guédelon.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the same time, the points of view of the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction have to be dealt with in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two camps are moving: there should be discussions on a common approach in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is confirmed by the Vereinsvorstände Torsten Stockaryd (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit together," says Stockaryd.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, all the members of the two clubs could pull together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, progress has been made more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the Burgfreunde, the late Richard Dimbath, until the last time a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain massif, has been in the forefront for the Burgverein, the "development und Erlebbarmachung" of the terrain is at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, has been very pleased about the call.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has been in charge of the Burgfreunden since Dimbaths death.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the moment, the club has a population of about 40 members.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have left the Portland out of respect at first," This "was necessary to think about how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current the within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is still no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone will find himself," he does not want to stand, because he has his domicile in Bad Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Toelzer wanted to participate in the project "but very much to work."</seg>
<seg id="24">The various points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">He praises Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">Through a high participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the course of time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project.</seg>
<seg id="30">There is nothing else there.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, the project could be financed by EU, pass and potential sponsors.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction does not, therefore, want me to simply throw it overboard," he hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps be slightly moved on this point.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal, first to document history, is "is important and good."</seg>
<seg id="34">After that, it could be there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save at Uni-Lehrbüchern</seg>
<seg id="2">As the cost of Uni-Lehrbücher for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder pondered a clever Sparidee.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a Leihsystem for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the went.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My Mathematikbuch normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Collegeleitung informed the students on average more than 1,200 $per year for textbooks and study, but for the students there were different Kostendämpfungsoptionen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online-Läden and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester long, often at a much cheaper price than buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 Universitätsbuchläden, announced that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Polls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books were rented in the College-Buchläden in the past semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks are purchased by the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in Campus-Buchläden.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the multiplication for the best deals.</seg>

<seg id="1">synomymous after the second win of the season three of the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">With the 2: 0 on Grödig, for Rapid a bitter week on Sunday a positive.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a Zwischentief in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The sense of achievement was extremely important," confirmed Captain and 1972 Steffen Hofmann, who with team on the spot three 1806.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel-Traumtor Rapid on victory Rapid, with the second winner of the season, showed the right response to the disappointment at Helsinki and goes to the Länderspiel-Pause with a sense of achievement.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said VfL Thomas worked, who has set the course for victory with his splendid Führungs-Volley from the Sechzehnereck in the 14th minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought, I up the whole frustration of Thursday pure and schnalzte him under the bar," said the 26-year smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">As worked on 13th Novmember 2010 for the last time in a Bundesligapartie, this was still for Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, the first Meisterschaftstreffer in the Rapid-Dress will remain in a special memory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"For me this is something special, I am from the Rapid-Nachwuchs," said worked.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short term Becken-Blessur of Mario Pavelic, worked moved from the left to the right Defensivseite and made his case very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has enough experience that he can also use this position as a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="13">The goal has earned him, he has already done some assists in this year ', praised Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character worked also supplied the flank to the 2: 0 by Hofmann after an hour, which finally brought the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because of this, we would have been able to send an email to the guests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we have had some luck today," also noticed worked, who was doing the between of performance and result in the past weeks,: "The results have not voted, but the Playful was always good compared to last year."</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic even found that "in many games had been better than today" - against "the strongest team played this season in this stadium."</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since 26 July proved, therefore, that the Mannschaftsgefüge has remained intact in spite of it: "Today, my team has shown that it has character."</seg>
<seg id="19">It is no less pleasing to him: 'That we have finally played back to zero'.</seg>
<seg id="20">Much work during DFB also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Pavelic, Deni and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their Startelfdebüts, make the victory even more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"You must not forget this," warned Barisic, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."</seg>
<seg id="22">The DFB must therefore be used to lick the wounds and to raise a bit in the physical area, "said Barisic, who has five U21-Auswahlakteure in his ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">One who is particularly fond of the break, is Captain Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="24">He is for the team, goes beyond pain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Especially during this difficult period he showed that he is a very important player for us, "said noted.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-Jährigen, who completed his 350., it was the first match from the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 over the Schaartor).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "we certainly have a bit of luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="30">He warned, however, to concentrated work: "You must not always see this in black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="32">We must not, however, believe that everything is right now.</seg>
<seg id="33">He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a very young team that I can very much help at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In certain phases, it is up to me, "said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig-Coach Michael Baur had little to reproach himself and his team.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the fast Vastic "out of the category," as well as the regular gate of commercial in the 40th minute, which had been unjustly denied by arbitrators Kollegger.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only reproach I can make is that we were not concrete enough for Tor in some phases.</seg>
<seg id="39">We have not had enough qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="40">Hertha Maximilian Maximilian saw it similar: "It has just started badly, but then we have found it and even made a Tor.</seg>
<seg id="41">In general, it would have been more in it.</seg>

<seg id="8">A small Buddha on a stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.</seg>
<seg id="9">But, despite intensive research, there were only references to the raspberries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheim archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to know what explanation it has with the Geißruheiche.</seg>
<seg id="11">The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the Ziegenhirten have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stones meadows.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the foot of the tree, the weary, exhausted by the rise, will have rested.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows it is actually grazing again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The area has also been explained to the Grafenegg of the Reserve, Schneider has continued to find out.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin calls for Kiev to include "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media coverage on Sunday that the Ukrainian government suspended the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dimitri Peskow, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that, under the control of the separatists, the region of eastern Ukraine will become a part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin " s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is in line with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots over five months ago: help for the separatists of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia, rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state-run television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian campaign to recapture the territories of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the "Novorossija" or "Khadjibey," a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt. and during the civilian communities in the territories held by separatists, are hoping for immediate peace talks "in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We need to engage in extensive talks immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus of the Südostukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin " s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the "misinterpretation " of Putin " s remarks underscored Russia " s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct Annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russian territory with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important seaport and historical coastal area.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Petro proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take into consideration the constitution, with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement to Moscow is being reproached.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin " s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatistenführern on an equal footing followed after another incursion of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the Azov region along the Azov Sea to eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists, supported by Russia, took over in the coup, which, according to fears Ukrainian security, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are nearing a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership required the proposal for further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an escalating escalation of nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian columns and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donezkregion to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Footballers 1898-1976, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Alpine-wide on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian-style territory, divided 1898-1976 on Sunday.</seg>
