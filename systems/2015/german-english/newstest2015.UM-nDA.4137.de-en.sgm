<seg id="1">Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal, the organization of trade unions to establish as a citizen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"as trade unions are dying, the Mittelklassejobs also die", said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and the deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I'm proud to work together with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the grounds of the organization of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of the national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes, a way for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a Gewerkschaftsvertretung to create before a civil court to get justice to complain - and in order to get compensation or Strafgelder - is a useful and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understanding what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the connection back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks, the trade unions, which have been subjected to in the last few years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries all over the world, encouraged to recognise and comply with labour rights, expand.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, of the millions of Americans still remember, when this country democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the Vereinigungsrecht in one breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States after the Second World War, Japan besetzte, encouraged General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff in the country to do so, to adopt a constitution, which should ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions in the creation of a new Japan, took a role, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of the workers to unite and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed".</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States after World War II, Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff the Germans, to write a constitution, which would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise themselves, and their voice in the new nation should speak up, added a clause to the Germans, the aussagte explicitly: "the right to form associations, and to the working and economic conditions will improve, and to secure to each and every individual and every profession or industry.</seg>
<seg id="15">The agreements, which restrict this right or aimed at it to belittle are null and void; this is abzielende measures are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was designed in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, has been taken over by Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that "everyone has the right to protect its interests, trade unions to form or join them".</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accept the Grundprämisse that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country, in other countries, such as one civilian and democratic societies, said Americans could form, that the law on the establishment of a trade union - and that this trade union collective bargaining, then as an equal partner with companies and government agencies must take part in - must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights in America under attack, it is indeed very wise, the American ideal and, consequently, to the working population must have the right to unite and engage in a free and open society in which to speak.</seg>
<seg id="20">As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:</seg>
<seg id="21">The history is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now we all know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation, but they grew.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people in work has miraculously created a market for the industry and the whole of the nation to unimaginable levels increased.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but the history they keep.</seg>
<seg id="25">The story reminds us, and that is something we should do.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of the labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past, and the promise of democracy einlösten.</seg>

<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on the stage, as he people imitierte and wrote to New Faces on him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His Fernsehkarriere began in the 1970s. "I was for a long time the only black impersonator / comedian on television".</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to not only before the eyes of the public, but will also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine through the television, while I was a star, and that was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny on New Faces in 1975.</seg>

<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, and TV and film is dominated by the next decade, but after his BBC-Serie LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "what are you doing next, Len, it is because they are all so feeling, when you have the time, or only around trittst a little on the spot".</seg>
<seg id="60">Then came a documentary for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode was about Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was virtually allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I was in the school never really learned something about him and kept him mostly for a preserve of the middle class, White in tights and a Kohlkopf WordReference front.</seg>

<seg id="67">Pick a few of the words in your mouth, and you will understand why we are all so love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was so excited about it.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's almost as if somebody gave me the head finally set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="71">"that is what it is, it is a serious matter, take them seriously, get your text, a bit chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece before we made it for months.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and that is simply not happening.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed". "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical mistake and Henry felt instinctively that he needs to talk to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"a little voice said to me" you will have to bridge is now 10 minutes, while the computer reparieren. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, he announced that the idea of the Bühnenleiter April, as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"you're playing in a play, so stay in your role".</seg>

<seg id="93">Henry, but still the head of a comedian - our conversation is of humorous outbreaks, while it is always people imitated.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided to not to make Stand-up-Comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="15">Kevern and Ailinn händchenhaltend had broken on the sun loungers sat in the high grass and an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag. both had enjoyed the Dienstkonsole eingeklinkt geistesabwesend in the country, with soothing music and soothing news, than the sight of their brown legs crossed to him, an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, was reminded of his father during the closed shutters in the home had.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the basis of their neat songs of this kind of aggression were not played more on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was so right - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been successful, as the word obsolesziert obsoleszieren.</seg>
<seg id="20">The general flavour of what rules, edicts and never have done, and how the people in the books, and the erstwhile Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren Liebesromane, so they choose the music the Balllades.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns big feet to sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn is not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this was a well known song of a Jazzpianisten Waller called anyplace", he told her, and put two fingers to his lips automatically.</seg>
<seg id="24">That his father had always done to the letter J to stop, before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a game between him and his father started, when he was still small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, as he was told.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you have a word with a J, start without two fingers on your lips, it costs you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game, and it was also not very funny.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn Antunovits had never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was, even if he was not directly prohibited, not played.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Improvisieren was not more modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only room for one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">The people at the start of a melody to be quite sure, where it would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">As well as the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was afrikanischer ausgedrückter mind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even though he was 10 years old, without of Sammy Davis Junior heard of Kevern, knew something about jazz of the half the secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he had to explain that not anyplace Ailinn, Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At their age, they probably could not remember a time, in the Popsänger were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A guessed society meant that every element of this society based on the principle of the grateful Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful as the fate spared.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with afro-karibischer origin were by temperament and physique for entertainment and sport, so she sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, as well as by the nature of electronic means were blessed with talent and with the task, to ensure that no family without functioning Diensttelefon remained.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewers; what was left of the Greeks, zerschlug on-teller.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly as Mahler GESCHEHEN WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN geschah- Mahler, for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, out of fear that the flames, and even they would be next as конкурсов Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants - had opened, and were given with the inaction depressed.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because they had heard only Balllades Ailinn, it was difficult to understand how the offensive words, you just had the Kevern vorgesungen, could be set.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"they are not really insulting", said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose feet are too great.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">The acoustic insulation could not overcome the huge kohlartigen leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn is still not understood.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would something like this should be your father love?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a Jux, hesitated, however, in their present two finger to the lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">You already thought that he was a bit odd.</seg>
<seg id="60">"it seemed to him", he said, laughing.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief and versperrte Keverns point of view.</seg>
<seg id="62">There have been all over the world, nothing else to see, as their ungekämmtes rabenschwarzes hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing, what he would want to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"if you can say", my it without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why you want it to be me vorsingst.</seg>
<seg id="66">You seemed to be worried, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="67">My feet are too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He saw once again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so directly.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say, you hate me, because my ankles are too fat?</seg>
<seg id="72">You hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is, after all, only the stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He would have been able to say "I love you", but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you give me gefällst", he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not correct.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was supposed to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">If he was trying to be funny, he was often in trouble, because he, like his father did not have the soothing charm, needed to overcome the inherent cruelty you have to ride.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps he wanted to be, Kevern,.</seg>
<seg id="83">In spite of its kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn acquisition was red and arose from their deck chair, threw to the console and buried the wine that they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Holunderblütenwein was drunkenness, so no excuse for him.</seg>
<seg id="86">In their excitement, it seemed to tremble, as Palmwedel in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"and your Dickkopf is exactly the reason why I am attracted to you feel perverted", she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not.</seg>
<seg id="89">You did him sorry, both because of the unnecessary for his words as well as the fear, which, in their eyes, as they showed against him auflehnte.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had had him from life on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it is, in essence, that was as here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge and eiskalte Ocean broke here, as there, on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even the skin and body height verdrießlicher after THE WHAT GESCHEHEN Mahler than their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, had been moved from pub to pub, always ready to shake the hand of a woman to speak out against them or verlachte refused.</seg>
<seg id="94">Dickkopf?</seg>
<seg id="95">They should have shown a big fist, if they are not nice!</seg>
<seg id="96">You only knutschen - Knutschen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, to the vacuous Gegengift Liebesballaden from the console - they only knutschen and then beat.</seg>
<seg id="97">After Keverns view was the result of an unnecessary, since the aging Knutschen itself was an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn acquisition gave him through her body, a sign to go.</seg>
<seg id="99">He arose from the sun like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">They also felt the brunt of his, but bleiern Caravan-raiding surprised them.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She saw him, as he is distant - as in the upper floor of a room in their companion - a man was watching him, complaining through something that he himself had been summoned.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam from the Garden, they thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">You felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some of them had their hands raised.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from her, bowed to his back, defeated, ashamed, without fighting spirit - and why was that a sight, they seemed to know well, if they are not at a single time, in which they could remember something like this before the day had already seen?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, looked Ailinn acquisition on her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Several years ago, had just told the trekmovie.com Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-jährige researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative Überwachungsorgan for the public mood, on a short lecture about the continued violence on low and intermediate level in the same areas, in which the reduction, if not abolish, are most likely to have been expected, given the money and energy that the elimination of this violence had been invested.</seg>
<seg id="109">"a great deal has already been done, and a lot still needs to be done", she wrote, "to the innate aggressiveness of a people to appease the thousands of wars, and most of them won, especially in the remote corners of the country, and in which the sweet breath of human kindness from a historical point of view, despite the Hogmanay Kirchtürme rarely feels between the hedges.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties are as unausrottbar.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the tower, it seems, the lower the passion that he still wakes up.</seg>
<seg id="112">The people crying, when listening to sentimental Balllades shock stories about brings difficulties and claims, on the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only the former harshness, the rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home, at work, on the roads and even on the green spaces.</seg>
<seg id="113">"you have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration", said her mentor, as he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less pusztítás.</seg>
<seg id="115">ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe that I must not say", said Esme Nussbaum.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you her?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme, again, on your right to privacy and the denial of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feministin?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not support this", said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I am against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism would be.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a vorurteilsfreien society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of Hypersensibilität, which in itself is absolutely acceptable and lawful, can occasionally results, as you have presented, they distort.</seg>
<seg id="126">You obviously have a prejudice against the church, and these things that you as a "deceitful" and "raw" described by others, could just as well of course as an expression of strength and vitality will be interpreted.</seg>
<seg id="127">If we continue on the herumreitet, WHAT IT TAKES GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS, IS, as if it would have happened, if it happened yesterday, means that the country would be essential to take his life.</seg>
<seg id="128">ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head in a LED-Schriftzug wiederholte Flamingorosa Ofnow, the advice of the the country in the last quarter century or more had given.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile your neighbor, you value their partner, do you hear Balllades, visit musicals, use your phone, you are talking about, do you, listen to you, and I apologise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, philosopher-clergyman word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I completely understand what you want to, and beyond", said Esme walnut with a calm voice, as she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing other than that, we are still not as effective as we are healed, even ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that we may find themselves without warning us here, as we repeat the mistakes in the first place, to DEM WHAT IT TAKES IS GESCHEHEN GESCHEHEN IS mannschaftbewerb.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time, there are but not the other, in which we take our anger and our suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz, a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">To suggest a Engelsgeduld.</seg>
<seg id="137">"you go too far", he said, "if it acts as a" mistake ", our grandparents may or may not have committed.</seg>
<seg id="138">You also go too far, if you speak about the fact that their "anger" and "suspicion" to "other" had been omitted.</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary, someone in your position to remind you that we in the understanding of the past, such as the protection of the present, not of "us" and "other".</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "other".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of the disorder, that is all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"if we are honest with ourselves", Esme einzuwerfen dared, "not a part of the society can claim to have to behave well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I klage anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">If it was bad or good has been done, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">It was at that time.</seg>
<seg id="146">To do this, nothing more to be said - and here we are unanimous on this.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as no blame must be assigned, so there must also be no debt will be repaid, if such a Board would be appropriate and if there is a way, they would have to pay off.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past, if we do not learn from this -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is one that we have forgotten them.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I have anything to say about that -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz had his piramīdas publication.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will remember, their report", he said, and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist, who described how passers-by, in a kind of "murderous rage" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="2">The increase in the production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the past 13 months, according to a study that observed with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit Einkaufsmanagerindex of manufacturing (,) fell in August at 50,7 in, after a stand of 51,8 in in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A claim over 50 there is an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders went back and factories have seen information in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come ahead of the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect the Bank to a clear plan for dealing with an ever-doubting of the recovery of the euro area, as well as for the threat of deflation, with an inflation rate of just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, additional information in the course of this week, if he could make a quantitative easing for the eurozone to take into account, in line with those of the United Kingdom and the United States have been made during the financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="66">The people in London, wept when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I understood at that time, as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was Cherie Blair and her foundation, grateful for the price, and the possibility, in the autumn of 2004, travel to London.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call her even Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I am still at the meeting me her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I still remember how Damir tortuosum borshch wanting to eat and they all local Russian restaurants anriefen.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember, as he played in a beautiful restaurant. Damir shot with his pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was just a month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world in these 10 years have not got better.</seg>
<seg id="75">The war in the Ukraine is now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many of the children were killed and are being killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are the kind of children as well as our own.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many of the war a part of the news is that they listen to, if they get bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know just what these people feel, all the horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop, to feel that.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is looking for, for example, not for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the last abominations.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally, in the sports hall and ignite candleligh there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was small, he was among them - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us away for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not asleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I remember, as he has all of his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge Kalpavriksha Bergquartett. Damir is now 17, more than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that, in a few hours, so I was sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">As I am after the explosion, and on the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with herumliegenden body parts everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible could have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted at him", Damir, lauf, lauf away ", but I was also so I am not sure that he had heard.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And this is the life, unlike that of many others, for us.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgy Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose terrible picture after the siege of the symbol of the horrors of Beslan was</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: the Beslan-Überlebende Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right, a picture of Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">His blutüberströmtes face was of fear, when he ran for his life, while his classmates niederschossen Chechen terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had sacked him for his first day of school, before they rushed to their older son Vladimir to get to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the court for about two minutes, before the terrorists stormed it, and so did my little boy for three terrible days alone", she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they have all been killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day that goes by when we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is a long time ago, I believe that it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days I am addicted to follow.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget that, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">To: the image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that Georgy on this day, so you want to go to school, and he said he wanted to hug his teachers.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy sees the image will not be happy, and it is with us at home, hidden in the guide.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that the people all over the world thanks to this picture, feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy said today: "it's important that something like this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">The people who investigate such tragedies, again and again and never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they investigate the crash of Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what has caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is becoming something of.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to make it a little bit to forget.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I feel it still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went later in the year 2004, and back to school every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.</seg>
<seg id="125">Therefore I go always in the gym, when the September 1 is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my my old Kindheitsfreunden.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is difficult for me to go, in the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I feel I am not as victims, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I am not sorry.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have this year and visit the school completed a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will be Herzchirurg.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was an education in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health is not allowed.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgy Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, although he was a murderous terrorists caught wellfitted</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall, sitting next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="140">It really is a wonder that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"we feel, as if it were yesterday, it would have been", says Georgy, who, as the FSB Geheimdienstoffizier wanted to go to, but this is because of his health damage due to the siege could not do.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is not something that I have behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and people say that children can cope easily with terrible experience - and I have to say, that is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt a bit better after that, actually, but I can not forget.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I was back in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never return, and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I wear it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically, it is good for me.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knees, but I can now well under way.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I could not participate in the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents, as well as the medical and they have said that it is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been there two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He is learning the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that my children would never tell from my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should know anything about it, of course, and they should not suffer.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "the pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">He is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I shall go to the commemoration ceremonies.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgy not to go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be for him to be much more violent, because he was there and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">God I am so grateful that it was returned to me in Beslan. here are all of them.</seg>
<seg id="168">It is in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept that, if a Unfaires something so bad.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he loves sport, but he could not attend because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several times, he can run, but not a sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome a horror to 50%, but it can be overcome and never forget.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege, and the only reinforced my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I have lost many people, who I knew well and I were too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families where children were born, but also of widows, who have never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if one does not want this.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how, in me, my heart jumped when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now, I do not see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country, and I can almost do not believe.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure that, in Ukraine, many children have been killed and many more will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we just throw all these rebels and could - so far away as only possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better Unterwasserfotos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you like photos or videos to make under water, there are a range of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot position, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 Action-Cam or a GoPro Hero3 + Silver as the edition, both for about 300 $.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have these photos at a family gathering with several cameras, all at a cost of under $350, are available.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the Batteriefach and other subjects have been closed down.</seg>
<seg id="8">You can also put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and HD camcorders feature Szenen- and Aufnahmemodi, with which the exposure time for the dämmrigen Unterwasserbedingungen www.o-atlas.de..</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, check, in which up to a depth of your equipment is operational.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are you looking for in our accredited to digital cameras and the ratings for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do you make Machines - because many do not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have a LCD, with which you can compose Action-Cams images, usually do not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD display, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right screen size is a matter of chance.</seg>
<seg id="16">You make so many shots.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a Reihenmodus, with a series of shots with slightly modified exposure settings, please use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will you stay close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light will be dramatically worse, the further you are removed from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible stay so close to the surface, if you are taking pictures in a swimming pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, you can also get more colour in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Are you close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">The country is also a good advice, but it is under water all the more important because of the bad conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's particularly important if you work with a Action-Cam: these devices often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse, which means that you have to be thick to your objects to this, if the whole of the Bildrahmen to fill.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, whose character has changed things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As a consulting Anästhesiearzt he devoted himself to the task of his career, the sick and the agony of the disease, as well as the anguish of the treatment to spare.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, remembers his wife, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, with the devastating effects of torture had to live.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important, while the largely invalid are dealing with a completely different: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, he was, however, the one whose ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt", he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulty aufzuraffen, me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he fought with the soil symptoms, he noticed that he and his wife Juliet chronicles the allegations made.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen, sooner rather than later", he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Juliet went away on business on a business trip, Lawson felt quite remarkably shifted and without any reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague, a X-ray Sarpek.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier, he was skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the X-ray lay before.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the lungs, so the Brustfell überziehende skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers, is the most difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, are not all Lungenkrebserkrankten smokers have been in the past.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost every case, is the catalyst for a Asbestbelastung - contact with the Faserbaustoff, who once was considered as "Wunderstoff" but has now been recognized as fatal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is a disease mesothelioma, which can easily ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type has been in Britain since the 1960's, not used any more, as the industry voluntarily committed to do, this is no longer to use.</seg>
<seg id="23">There, too, where he was used only in certain industries, people who worked directly with the substance - plumbers, carpenters and construction workers, for example, the shipyard workers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial Gefahrstoff from a different time today, he seems to be a cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, saw the at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic today.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease and as die in accidents in motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual figures from the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and the presumed future deaths in Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are now witnessing the fatal consequences for years, although asbestos is illegal (in 1999, they have all been banned Asbesttypen), is the one that developed mesothelioma after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction sector.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is often still in the houses, in which we live, the offices, in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the shops, where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore no Klassenschranken piano-chamber mesothelioma, financial limitations, occupations or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a bunker.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament buildings are asbestverseucht.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even in the hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, but are already as this deadly Karzinogens Ausgangsherde have been identified.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was, in fact, hard to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos could be.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he put his finger on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it seems as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos". he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everybody, students, nurses, doctors, and Pförtner - use the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will be suffering from the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">This question, unfortunately, he was unable to answer, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"of the four doctors at Guy's Hospital were trained, and in the last five years, suffering from mesothelioma", he wrote in a letter, "I am the last one is still alive".</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will get this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">In Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long survival time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only reiterate Lawsons question: "how many of us are still being get disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, is that between 1870 and 2050, if the Asbestepidemie in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, it will be a total of 90,000, have fallen victim to the disease will be.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them have no idea at the moment, so that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">A Asbestmine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the courts, the people affected often because of damage, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, to Sulu Allen fahrlässigerweise exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible on the Kleidungsabteilung at two locations - one of them the Flagshipstore in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they work in M & S began.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now, she has two children in the Twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"before this thing", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have thought that that would affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact of the matter is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the PVC, the fabric is durable and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Asbestos, also known as white asbestos, this is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was for Dachplatten Fußbodenplatten Rohrisolationen Boilerisolierungen,,,, even for brake pads used in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other Asbestformen, however, is from the EU and the World Health Organization as a "big risk" with possible death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it is clear, however, indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the high Mesotheliomraten was unique".</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was taken in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, exposed to asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Sulu Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto, which suggests that their story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected will be presented, in that "a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in the home by Asbestkontakt probably in the environment has caused".</seg>
<seg id="75">A large part of these contacts is based on his words, the "normal use and ageing of our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as though no one could assume, to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, the Palace of Westminster, also shows how people in the heart of the government, unwittingly exposed to the substance may have been.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, reported that the Serviceschächte and pipes behind the Ausschussräumen of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres by something as harmless as "strong air movements" could be an outcry.</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests, but here, it looks as if the opposite is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the direction of the Parliamentary Arbeitsdienstes insisting that the Westminsterpalast Gesundheitszeugnis received a "clean", it is now undisputed that £1 billion over the course of several years of work that needs to be paid to the Parliament to be renovated, the electronic installations to modernise and to remove the asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015 are the Members will meet in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum rather than on the green benches in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard-Bericht also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with the respective provisions has been handled".</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person, the contact with asbestos could never determine exactly is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott that he was during his work in hospitals, the asbestos was exposed to.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked in a hospital, Asbestklagen were decided in the positive", he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so difficult to get to all the places where you have to remember that, and has worked on the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What exactly is he still recalls the day in early December 2009, he had a kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and was just an operation by late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly, I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It was all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt awful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I believed that the home not to create more.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, knew Abbott that the pain from the Brustfell, the skin around his lungs around herrührten.</seg>
<seg id="95">But, as Captain Sulu Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He went a month not to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Doctors were surprised his chest X-ray and Pleurakathether, in order to remove fluid from the lungs, and in the laboratory to test.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health stabilized slowly, and he returned to his job back.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time, however, the symptoms return, often after high-solubility and fierce breahing.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, Abbott was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now, this is not the Abbott with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was a few decades older, and had worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened and his family brought his CT-Scans and X-ray to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between Rippen- and introduced the Brustfell.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just kept on going, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest, I had so many worries me not at all.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year's: "you told me that it was mesothelioma".</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott appointments with Macmillan-Krankenschwestern, one of which, it is recommended to take a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now, he understood the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"it turned out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings, where pipes with asbestos were often isolated", he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, ill now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so is mesothelioma now younger people, not in the typical professions have been working on.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous tubes with Asbestisolierungen führten in hospitals under the earth, so patients are more likely not to have been exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, from one building to another Fußgängertunneln changed (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott (as it often did), with most likely came into contact with the toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It turns out that for several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">He is still away.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was due to its efficiency and flammhemmenden properties are often in offices, shops, libraries and Stadthallen used.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools, too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many people have probably had the first Asbestkontakt in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, thousands of Chemiestunden, have students on their Bunsenbrenner Asbestmatten.</seg>
<seg id="128">On Web sites will be the issue of asbestos in schools now often mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile have so innocent items in our houses like Fußbodenplatten Schuppendächer contain asbestos or by default.</seg>
<seg id="130">"it's a Industriegift that, in large parts of our real estate", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, Andrew Lawson in his trial, Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, was the only contact, of an affected woman, suddenly the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970's.</seg>
<seg id="132">So you go on, as you shed your mattress.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"it takes a while to digest", says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work, and tried to carry on, but I realized that I could not focus on that, what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks ago in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then, I knew that I go to and I had to take care of myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the perspective of the position of a medical doctor to that of a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he recalls, as he was overwhelmed by all the information was, with whom he had to come.</seg>
<seg id="141">"it was very hard, all of this", he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor how long I have?"</seg>
<seg id="143">And you gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "Oh, yes, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it then. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is a particularly treacherous, because it is our Lebenserhaltungsmechanismus - the breahing itself - is that the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most of the cases of mesothelioma are caused by Asbestkontakt.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos fibres and the outcry will be inhaling, they can in the Brustfell, the skin around the lungs, to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres can irritate and cause the Brustfell Zellmutationen.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the problem is with the inhalierten nadelförmigen asbestos fibres", says Professor Tom Treasure, a Herz-Thorax-Arzt, the 2001 at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">This is exactly what the hospital, of which Andrew Lawson suggested that it has suspended the asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and a few others, the probably also during their training in hospital after they were exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the Asbestnadeln the Lungengewebe, says Treasure, "they will be of the Atemvorgang to the edge, where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is by its nature invasive right from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options in other cancers in mesothelioma does not work so well.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly disputed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"it is possible the Brustfell not under pressure", he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">They come with the knife did not beat about the bush.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy is not very good", the "effect", but not heals.</seg>
<seg id="163">"sometimes there are Langzeitüberlebende", says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But at the end of the day, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some of the patients, in fact, live a long time, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author, Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fighting.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he contacted Abbott had mesothelioma, came in contact with Andrew Lawson, of the four years after his diagnosis a Ein-Mann-Unterstützungs- and consultancy for Mitbetroffene had become.</seg>
<seg id="169">"hello, Krebszentrale", he cheerfully on calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"he was very positive", says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Abbott six Chemotherapiezyklen were originally offered the four months, and his life is only expected to last a month, would be extended.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate", he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, was "the things in a more positive light".</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors decided to Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Herz-Thorax-Spezialist Lang-Lazdunski, at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we had an advantage because of the fact that I have not had to be weiterverwiesen, I called right away and got a date", Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is a key factor for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte the best available therapies, in order to be able to perceive.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments fail, after all, inevitably, there are many people of a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"it is known that asbestos since 1898, is extremely dangerous for the health", says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">In the 1960s, but what has changed is that we realized that even a very low burden was a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And this is where the negligence of the companies have a role to play.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, after all with their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "full compensation", as Lawson not with absolute certainty, that could prove to be a mesothelioma Asbestkontakt at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman for the Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres in the affected Kellerbereich in the 1990's have been removed".</seg>
<seg id="188">This was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">Such as asbestos may be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">It is, in fact, for Mesotheliom-Erkrankte, to seek compensation, a huge problem, the deadly Asbestkontakt a company or a job on the frequency - normally decades after the events.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have been sold or closed down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Versicherungsunterlagen can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend itself against the claims, know that the time for it, but it is certainly not with recognised the authors.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, there has been strong this year, the new legislation makes it easier for Mesotheliom-Betroffene beforeany, compensation, even if their former employers are no longer here.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has one of the insurance industry, supported by funds of £350 million for all established, diagnosed after July 2012, a contact can prove, but no one can sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court would have them in a normal Schadensersatzprozess zusprechen can - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-Betroffene that £350 million in a "very good work" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"It's a deal of insurance for insurers", he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time is not known, and it would be the company and they find Mesotheliom-Erkrankte normal could sue.</seg>
<seg id="200">Also, Mike Penning, who was working and Pensionsminister, has acknowledged that the law was "not perfect".</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning as Morgan gave to that, in the face of seven deaths every day a quick action was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">"the people are suffering so much and need help", said Penning today during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-Gesetzes in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this point in time was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first debate Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he, unlike Tom Treasure is expected to have a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - accompanied by a Dreifachtherapie Lang-Lazdunski, with a survival rate of more than five years of up to 40 percent can present.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"this is, of course, with the most important thing", says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">You can see that again in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something that you can just carry on.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you aufgibst, it is you very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he had the last of the six Chemotherapiezyklen behind.</seg>
<seg id="213">Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There have been several Krebs-Flecken to my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It's not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Abbott again underwent six Chemotherapiezyklen.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now, there is no trace of the tumors more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - on the money, if not more, for example, am I, or my wife, show how the Boilerzeiteinstellung works.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Elly, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"for parents, It's difficult", he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know what we should say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I have a disease, with which I would not grow old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They were quite different.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable.</seg>
<seg id="231">They told their friends and we soon got very many calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Elly was Lapajne.</seg>
<seg id="233">She said not much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such discussions are something that all cancer patients have to go through.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope, and not a trace of hope of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease will eventually also (like Stephen Jay Gould) for a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denied the right to Hong Kong, demonstrators Regierungswahl swear revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong's electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably fueled the protests in Hong Kong, announced during the planning and mobilization to activists in the space of a few hours after the announcement was made in and out of the way.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders, do not, in principle, all pekingtreuen candidates rejected.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not unexpected, but it makes us angry", said bastions of Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has taken advantage of the inhabitants of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that, with an authoritarian regime, we have to do.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defence of China's decision, said Li Fei Vizegeneralsekretär of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the authorisation of public nominations in elections for Hong Kong's government to "chaotic" would be.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to the people in 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision from the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it is the citizens of Hong Kong, there is a direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership by the end of a closely controlled by Beijing Nominierungskomitee firmly in hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a new clause should also only candidates "with love for the country and love Hong Kong" are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest protests in Hong Kong and publikumswirksamsten took place for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened the acupuncture, off, if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, in the space of a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anhängern in the rain before the Regierungshauptquartier gathered in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration, said the organizers, that their civil disobedience movement to a new level and they have reached the Protestwellen planned in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They were, however, not to the data, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a Online-Mitteilung diadochs the organizers with the fact that the movement "the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only as a last resort has taken into consideration, an action which is to be held only when all Dialogchancen have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry to have to say that today, all Dialogchancen options have been exhausted and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks definitely will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have since the days of the announcement, and we were prepared for Beijing on Sunday in front of the government buildings increased security measures, including police forces and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The riots will be provided by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that she slowly lose control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, there is a growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure from Beijing to begin to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-Bewegung, as they have the operation - the lifeline of Hong Kong - risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the protests, of which they speak, could be a lot of economic harm, depending on how many are involved and how long they last", said Regine bastions of Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong spiralling out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on the Demokratieaktivisten in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. was killed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot", while they were waiting for the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of Michael Brown, the unarmed Teenagers www.dowwolffcellulosics.com blogger Miriam Zoila Perez, a change in the Onlinediskussionen white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race, when it comes to Reproduktionsrecht and income.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions in the Midwest and across the country, however, increased attention was given to Perez that the responses of white women to 100% of the german.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots came from the 9th of August the personal essays with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez was an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not believe that many people in the feminism, which is about the white and privileges and kind of talk about it", she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt forced to express something about the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's a characteristic feature of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson so ethnisiert is that they need to express.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought the problems to light, those black Amerikanerinnen are exposed to every day, but not as a "women's issues" in the cultural space.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can be a bit funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 likes from everywhere", said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I was a little bit about poste, as people in their own country are under siege, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"how can it be safe for women, to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public space?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, such as Mitchell, the race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between Rassen- and Geschlechterproblemen.</seg>
<seg id="17">For they have not had the luxury of black women, the issues of clean to separate; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are now the issues of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen Banquetting, says Angela Hattery, professor of women and at the George Mason University, that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"between 1865 and Waldfeuer at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman", said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women in history have had to be involved, in order to justify the Lynchmord.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery came the split between white and black women to the point where white female fighters for the suffrage as Susan B. Anthony, the country in the late years of the 19th century analysed and stated that the fight for the right to vote only for a group could be successful: women or black people.</seg>
<seg id="22">"they made the decision to use for suffrage, and the right to vote for black people should come later", said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you look at such things, one with power, will be aware of why 5-color women white women do not trust.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have our job not well done.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women, their husbands and sons to protect.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was founded almost 40 years after the original plea for help from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell is the flood of white feminist responses to the questions that have been raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists "catch" with the problems with black women, which has been set apart for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"wouldn't it be great if the activists, the more than such traditional feminist platforms have the right to education of a child so seriously nähmen as it with the right to Empfängniskontrolle do?" asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation, their career on the fight for reproductive rights and their access to contraceptive methods, are now seeking to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointierten article by Rebecca Carroll, Kolumnistin of the Guardian in which they more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who had a different, but parallel reason have an inherent risk of the body to understand - and opinions on race, in the public opinion polls are clearly very different - the changes to be", Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though Steinem for a rather intersektionalen feminism is, as well as in the Rassen- Car-jackings Geschlechterthemen, are some of their comments on race in America but is truly amazing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina summer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" said to She The People, that young men in the United States, in particular, young men, "5-color far are more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinems to Ferguson's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's' auflegte verletzlichen, to young black and Hispanic men, to help it was infuriating reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is in the forefront of the Mainstreamfeminismus constraineth.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the almost 76,000 US-Grenzpolizei CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o unaccompanied minors in the country this year, has taken on the issue of immigration is also returned to the surface - this time as an issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Islacom Co-Vorsitzende of We Belong Together, an organisation which women mobilised for the immigration, said that for a reassessment of the issue as a major issue, it merely needs to publish the stories of Einwandererfrauen.</seg>
<seg id="40">"these speak for themselves", said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of Arbeitsvisa to male immigrants, are the women that accompany it, in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"these stories will find a finish in the women's organisations", she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax burden of business people in the area of Washington is increasing along with the economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local Steuerbescheide for companies in the country in the last year, rose slightly, while the economic recovery is accelerating, according to a new study published in the past week, and the companies in the area of Washington, were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the area of the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $27,6 billion to state and local authorities in the fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared to the revenues of 2012 in the amount of $26.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of the companies in the last year, rose 4.3 per cent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year before, and it was the third consecutive growth after several years of decline expected in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes have increased more than the local taxes, 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by Ernst & Young, the Maintenance with the Center for State taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue of the District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 per cent of the revenues come from businesses Marylands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia scored with 28% the lowest tax revenues from companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery in the company's investment, say the researchers, leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern to 3.7 percent this year, according to the three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits from big states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be also true for the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local Immobiliensteuern last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year to 4.2 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the Immobilienwerten in Maryland is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenue, because here the Immobiliensteuern to barely more than a fifth of the Steuerbescheide of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Maryland, the following is happening: a large part of the real estate, especially in the Steuergebiet to D.C., is either owned by the government, or by non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern", said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on the State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to, for example, is much more on the personal income taxes to leave, in order to be able to offer the same services, the other states offer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot alone be the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Businesses in the region have reported income of about $2.3 billion in Staatsorganisationen compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took a $1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend in the same direction, increases the local tax burden for companies not evenly to all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The pace of the District was 4.3 per cent, with the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches 武三思 of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has 6 percent in all three of the least Amtsbereichen autonoumus Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern (in all three there are fixed income-tax).</seg>
<seg id="25">The Unternehmenssteuersatz is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, and state and local taxes are required and there is generally a better Steuerklima than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study, the District was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has to reduce its income-tax laws this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will be launched next year to 5 percent decline.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to be his Einkommensziele in the coming year, this law could be achieved the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz until 2017 the state up to 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems that it is the small businesses in the Washington area, better to go, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the most recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes, personal income taxes as paid by small business people - a Übergangsstruktur, after most of the small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia in the last year, rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the rise in corporate taxes in the whole country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in the general Mehrwehrsteuereinnahmen for the state and local governments to 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Washington, however, could be the space behind, if the spending of the federal government on the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Burgvereine will soon be back on the same?</seg>
<seg id="2">The last time there was always between the two Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgvereinen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boards now think about a possible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">As an example, for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub Burgfreunde, lengthen the project in French.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago there was no good and the atmosphere between the Burgverein Burgfreunden Tölz-Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">So far, the points seemed to be very different, as with the history of the Wolfratshauser Aktienclub castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, the two camps to move towards each other: it should soon be talks on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">This confirmed the Vereinsvorstände Speedflying Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde), on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have Mr Piffl mobile-tailored and suggested that we could be together again", reports Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, could all members of both clubs to pull together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">So are more visible successes.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the Burgfreunde suddenly to the late Richard Dimbath last to a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest, stands for the eye to the "Sjöberg Burgverein Überhäufung and Erlebbarmachung" of the terrain in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert, chairman of the second Piffl Burgfreunde, according to their own figures about the phone call was very happy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since he is the Burgfreunden Dimbaths death.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is expected to be in the middle of September in a general meeting will be found.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, the association is one of about 40 members, according to the access.</seg>
<seg id="17">"after the death of my friend Richard Dimbath activities out of respect we have the first Neptulon". this "Denkphase" was necessary, "to consider how it could go on like this".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the new chairman then Piffl is said to be in the conversation with the Burgverein.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, could the Burgfreunde also a current mood within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">A candidate for the presidency, there is currently not yet, says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but I am confident that someone will find". he himself does not want to stand for election, because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser Aktienclub.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer "on the project, but would very much like to work on".</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view in terms of reconstruction, in the eyes of Piffls will probably remain in place in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">It gives Dimbath as a "missionary", always on the restoration of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a chimera.</seg>
<seg id="27">Through a high level of participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="31">In addition, the project would be by EU-Zuschüsse, type and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the idea of reconstruction and, personally, I do not simply want to jettison". he hoped that the Burgverein in this point may be something moves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal, the first to document history, "is important and it is good".</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on Uni-Lehrbüchern</seg>
<seg id="2">As the cost of Uni-Lehrbücher for many students more than $1,000 per year, contemplated the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder, a clever Sparidee.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a Leihsystem for books by students of higher semester, and offered a nominal compensation to the Rückverkauf to delay.</seg>
<seg id="4">"my Mathematikbuch normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks", said Schroeder, 19, of the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The for the last semester LPRng books would have cost him $430, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Collegeleitung shared with the students, on average, more than $1,200 per year for textbooks and spend Studienmaterial, that it is for the students, however, were different Kostendämpfungsoptionen.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online-Läden and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hiring of textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 Universitätsbuchläden, said that the hiring of Textbüchern have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Polls in the industry, show that about a quarter of the books in the last Frühjahrssemester College-Buchläden was hired, said Vreenak Neebos Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks are Handelsvereinigung, according to the National Association of College Stores in Campus-Buchläden bought.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the multiplication table for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buy online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books online only cost a third of the price, for which they are in the Campus-Buchladen.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, may, however, in the case of the specialized Lehrbucheinzelhändler Chegg.com 239,99 Lieren for $$$.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy used,</seg>
<seg id="18">If one of the notes or other normal.. nothing, second-hand books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Oxford" is needed on Chegg.com for 93,49 $.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Abschlussstudent Casaday, 25, of Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on AMZF 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was recently sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, the director of the University of Massachusetts Amherst College Without Walls recommended to students, with their professors, whether past spending is permissible.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the Seminararbeiten.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the older spending can often for a fraction of the cost for the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Except Chegg and Amazon is also Half.com from eBay Inc, a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rent</seg>
<seg id="27">The hiring of textbooks is one worth considering, if you treat them fairly well, remember, they take the books back and after the conclusion of the course, not to keep.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can do more than 80 per cent of the cost of the new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">A student could, for example, "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Know the rules of the business where you can hire, even on the amendment proposal, which, if necessary, for the writing of notes, underscores or tears.</seg>
<seg id="31">Najemców beware: if you can return the book not the amendment proposal, the price of buying a new book, even.</seg>
<seg id="32">Portrayal</seg>
<seg id="33">Instead of conventional portrayal of textbooks are also an option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books are, de facto, rented by an electronic license for a certain period of Chegg, as well as retailers such as Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble Inc. is being provided.</seg>
<seg id="35">At Chegg, you can "Calculus" for 6 months rent for about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says that students in Literaturkursen often find the best deals, as many classic today, can be downloaded for free, while scientific and ingenieurwissenschaftliche textbooks can be very costly.</seg>
<seg id="37">On every case.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, of the demnachst the Pepperdine Law School, will visit the ISBN-Nummer recommends for the Preisbestimmung in books, because you can be sure that it is, to find the right textbook.</seg>
<seg id="39">And before you consider requests should be, whether the book, in fact, Gault, stock is.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned this lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">He bought a book, that four weeks and, after all, had paid the full price in the College-Buchladen.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskow made clear later that Putin does not have to mean that, under the control of the separatists in the area of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia, but that his status in relation to the Ukraine needs to be redefined, to the power of the Russian-speaking region to the representation of his rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on equal footing with the pro-russischen fits to the insurgents, but from him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently pursued strategy: to provide support for the separatists in the Einnehmen of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government, to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for a alliance with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted in the area as "Novorossija" or "Yeni Dünya", a concept that goes to the heart of the pre-revolutionary to restore the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all of those who, in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt. and while Regierungsgruppen civilian communities in the areas held by the separatists attack on an early peace talks hope "in their illusions" are caught, told Itar-Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we need to immediately begin detailed discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus the Südostukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there", he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy, the need to be seen for months by the Kiev leadership is discussed, in Russian-speaking areas in order to allay fears that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in the Ukraine".</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlsprechers to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of the Crimea, the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far greater difficulties, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants, no Russians are, and surveys from the time before the conflict, a large majority for staying in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy of the Russian diplomats on international forums has been raised, would the regional governments in the Ukraine, to give authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and as the Kremlin's de facto control of a territory, the Russian territory of Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">Five months ago, annexed the peninsula in the Black Sea is the home base for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, the important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech to the inauguration on June 7, before that the Ukrainian legislation, amendments to the constitution after the elections - should consider where the respective areas, with greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy, which seems to be in the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand, their weapons, and Moscow is accused of incitement.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call to Kiev, with the Separatistenführern to negotiate on equal footing, was followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Asowschen sea in the eastern Ukraine are entered.</seg>
<seg id="20">Supported by Russia, the separatists took over 1519-1563 Sicherheitsbeamter according to the fears of the first step in a campaign to take on the strategic coastal region to the Crimea is, the control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, the massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol, a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants, to fortify the between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU-Führung in Brussels and asked for urgent actions in order to further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic to prevent, the 23 years of independence.</seg>
<seg id="23">"we are on the eve of a point at which there is no turning back", warned Poroshenko.</seg>
