Konstantin Weckers brutally honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony as biography, as in "monk and warrior" Konstantin alarm clock, songwriters, pacifist politicians certainly activist, ex-prisoner, 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought shreds of thoughts shreds, Munich, born on 1 June 1947 written his memoirs, each chapter with a suitable song lyrics.
And he is brutally honest, he is not a human weakness from the Onanie as a schoolboy to shoplifting and drug use.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his profits.
Leeway also abstract, but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, Being in the now, spirituality - all of which he is trying to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also a very personal way.
And he also explained his pacifism, his critique of society, its political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has the living man Konstantin alarm is also closer to the ascetic monk, "created by subtraction," as he says, "by saying" everything Unn√∂tige saves.
Between all the high-minded views, but there are also short anecdotes on earth: about beatings in a restaurant frequented by or did a crazy ride, in which he envisaged head on a tree.
Here, too, he is brutally honest.
