Perry says that Texas was not authorised derogatory tweet
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday featured a disparaging remark about the democratic district prosecutor, which lies at the heart of a criminal indictment against him for misuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's account of the previous abstritt.
A tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorised by me.
"I do not agree with the tweet, and I have deleted it," it said in the message.
Employees of Perry responded immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official account, was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the earlier tweet was an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor in Travis County, Rosemary mud mountain, was sentenced for drunken driving in April 2013.
Perry put a veto on the financing of their offices when she refused to resign, which could be an indictment of Perry - perhaps 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The text of the tweets reads: "I do not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol... but if I do, I would accuse Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert."
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.
Clay's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation by the grand jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political ploy.
His top-class team of defence lawyers requested the judge tasked with the case, rejecting the charges and argued that the law, which is the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas, unverfassungsgemäß diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and in cases of state corruption in Texas - as mud mountain refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
After he had finished with the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as a fifth, Perry went to speculation that he will stop, when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
