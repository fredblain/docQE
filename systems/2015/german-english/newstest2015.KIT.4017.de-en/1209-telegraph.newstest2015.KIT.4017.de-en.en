Garden centres regret homeowners falling numbers
The decline, along with a greater decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to garden centres, tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, the "core age group for garden products."
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend on housing for their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure, bitumen gardens for park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry in the estimated Â£ 5 billion a year in sales.
In the urban area of London, in which over a period of six years, the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest spending on garden products per household reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society, indicate that housing for rent or small gardens can not mean that people are not plants.
Guy barter, chief garden adviser for the RHS, said: "container gardeners, for example, is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants in a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail due to rising homeowners figures and economic prosperity of the late 1980s until the mid-1990s.
He also predicted for this year, an improved market situation because of better weather for unfriendly weather in March and April last year.
