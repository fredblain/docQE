In a statement to the New press, he contradicted statements of CEO peer Medau and certifies this to pose "as a commander."
The style of the university, this is not stated in the communication.
The family was already " Medau orally in mid-June had been informed about the request of the university.
The statement that the plans were first announced in July, are definitely wrong, " says Pötzl's bodypaintings.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "Vorfestlegungen or decisions," but there are "preferences".
Also necessary for the entrance of the narrow road up to the castle is less dramatic than the Medaus feared.
A nine-meter wide road and there is no question.
It is to stand at 5.50 meters, it is a metre wider than before, " explains Pötzl's bodypaintings.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school own parklands will in future only be used by students of the university, Pötzl's bodypaintings will not accept.
Zugeparkt is not at all, because it can be solved, as in other public parking become intelligent.
Think of the residents
The nursery Bergwichtel, located on the site and the entrance to the parking deck along in their backyard, would not be affected, according to the university president. "
In fact, he said that " it is not just about the nursery, but also to the residents at the junction of Friedrich-Streib street and 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it is about much more than about vested interests of Mr Medau, " says Pötzl's bodypaintings.
Whether the criticism of the parents of the children's nursery with the expansion of the road would be a "of the few natural spots Coburgs are lost,"  "the reader can decide for themselves."
In early October to inform Pötzl's bodypaintings, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg the councillors on the development of the university by 2020 "and in this context, to raise the importance of the new development."
Peer Medau had last week informed the parents of the children's nursery on the plans of the university.
Therefore, the access road to the new parking deck is on the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-road, but on the Medau-mountain.
The narrow road should be approximately 1 km in length zweispurig.
According to projections from the Medaus would increase traffic in the park of Castle High rock.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
On the part of the city, there has been no comment on the project.
