The devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa, a severe blow to the economy.
The crops rotting in the fields, the mines are left orphaned and the markets - the virus has added to the region.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the chief judge of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we are losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, clothing sold in the second-largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Now on the market, only those who want to buy food or something to disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone, the fever of more than 600 people fell victim.
Recently, the health authorities declared that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
In Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
Overall, died more than 1500 people, thousands more stuck up.
Foreign firms attract employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries of their companies.
Foreign companies, such as the steel company ArcelorMittal withdraw their employees from several international airlines fly to the affected regions.
Also, the local traders and farmers react: only a few merchants leave their homes to buy supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the rot in quarantine, among other things, important for the export of cocoa and coffee beans in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, which is normally on the market and sold vegetables, prefer to remain at home.
The population directly, therefore the consequences of the epidemic and urgent: food is scarce.
In the markets is dwindling stocks of staples such as rice.
At the same time threatens the region heavily dependent on international companies a reputational damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies to avoid the area for a long time, basically, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What is decisive is how far and how long will still spread the virus.
For investors, could give the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease also interferes with the strained state budgets in the states
The disease also burdened the already strained state budgets of the Member States concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's is concerned that their budgets are under severe strain from high spending on the health care system and by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank have already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
While the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta region has not been affected.
But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations at hotels are dwindling.
