Teenager flown out from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bush walkers were transported with the winch to safety after they were caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke shortly after noon Sunday in Govetts Leap in Blackheath on her tour.
Worried relatives called the police at about 8.00 p.m., when the two had not returned home.
A search party broke from local police and rescue services, and the couple was found in the vicinity of Bridal Veil Falls at about 11pm.
The girl was injured in the knee and the man had fallen and had his head turned.
Rescuers stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken in stable condition with an ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
