An exclusive extract from Howard Jacob's hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J".
They zerflossen, it could be the best way to describe it, they have faded away slowly, like a cardboard, standing in the rain.
Occasionally, he told a woman that he is too serious, demanding, intense, aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig.
And then shook his hand.
Kratzbürstig knew he did.
He was stachelig, like hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was a nascent affair, which had been promising for alleviating the lonely tedium of his life, and he may even have brought a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn solo Mons was trembling a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flapping heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben.
She had come with an older accompaniment to the south, the Kevern for her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a damp but paradise Valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.
For several years, no one had ever lived in the house.
The pipes were taking in the bathrooms were still spiders, slugs have left their mark on all windows and believed them to belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage.
It was like the house of a children's story, both threatening as tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the long list for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both were absent in the spirit of the console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their very own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolesziert, just as the word obsoleszieren.
The general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how the people in books choose From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and love novels, they chose the music of the ballads.
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern an imaginary piano to play and sing in a gross-weird Serenade Ailinns big feet.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"It was a well-known song, a jazz pianist called fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he was told.
If you start off with a word with a J, without two finger over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very fun game, and it was not very funny.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was, even though he was not directly, not banned.
The improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
The people wanted to be sure where they would end up at the beginning of a melody.
Also the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, knew Kevern something about jazz in the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to explain Ailinn, fats Waller was black.
At her age she probably could not recall a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society grateful agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as spared by fate.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique for entertainment and sports, sang them and ran.
People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family left without a functioning telephone service.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewage system; what was left of the Greeks was.
Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose large parents were not quickly leave the country as SHE GESCHEHEN WAR, WHEN ES GESCHEHEN WAR-happened out of fear, to be indicted for fire, stirring up, out of fear, even, that the flames would consume them as the next - were Labneh and shisha pipe-opened restaurants, kept in mind and were depressed by the inaction.
From each according to his abilities.
Since they had only heard ballads, it fell to Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words Kevern she had just vorgesungen could be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"That is not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn understood still is not.
Why would something like love your dad?
He wanted to say that it was a jest, however, was reluctant to give two fingers to their lips in their presence.
They already thought he was a little odd.
"It was funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and locked Keverns view.
There have been around the world to see, nothing other than their ungekämmtes raven black hair.
There was nothing to what he would want to see otherwise.
"If you say," I do it without conviction.
But that still does not explain why you do it to me vorsingst.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
My feet are too big?
He looked again.
So your feet do not directly.
Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...
And you say, you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
You just hate it?
Of course, I do not hate you.
This is only the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you find me gefällst," he tried it instead.
I am being a bit perverse.
This is not right.
It was supposed to be funny.
If he was trying to be funny, he was often in trouble because he, like his father did not have the soothing charm that you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite its friendly eyes.
Ailinn solo Mons was red and arose from her deck chair, threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking.
Holunderblütenwein, drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble as palms in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I feel perversely drawn to you," she said....
Except that I am not that.
She was tired of him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was demonstrated in their eyes, when they revolted against him.
She thought that he would beat them?
She had not told him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same vast and icy Ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher to DEM WHAT WAR GESCHEHEN than were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman they refused or derided.
Dick head?
It would have shown a big bat if they took care not!
They knutschen - Knutschen was the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - it knutschen and then beat.
It was an unnecessary refinement to Keverns view, since the Knutschen itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn solo Mons gave him going through her body.
He rose from the deck chair, like an old man.
It was also bleiern, but she was surprised by the ferocity of his grief.
It was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew.
She saw him, as he is distant - as from a room on the upper floor of her companion looked on him - a man complained, something he himself had summoned.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had their hands against them.
A man turned on her, bowed to his back, embarrassed, defeated without fighting spirit - and why it was a sight seemed to know them well when they could not remember a single occasion on which she had ever seen before today, something like this?
When she was alone again, looked Ailinn solo Mons on her feet.
Several years ago worked just told incidents Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, in a short speech about the continued violence on low and middle-level in the parts of the country, in which the reduction, if not abolish, most likely to have been expected, given the money and energy, which were invested in the eradication of this violence.
" It is a great deal has been done, and much remains to be done, " she wrote, " in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness, historically, despite the towering spires rarely felt between the hedges.
But some properties stand out as an ineradicable.
The higher the tower, it seems, the less the passion he arouses.
The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads, intoxicated with stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but even so, not only the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you an atheist?
"I think that I do not have to say," said Esme walnut.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked their right to privacy and remain silent.
Feminist?
Again, silence.
" I do not ask this, " said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, " because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are perfectly acceptable and laudable, occasionally can distort results, as you have presented to them.
You yourself obviously prejudice against the church, and those things that you describe as "sneaky" and "raw," could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of, of course, vigour and vitality.
If you continue on rides, WHAT GESCHEHEN IST, WHEN ES GESCHEHEN IS, as if it were, if it had happened yesterday, means the country of its essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum felt, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head, had repeated a LED sticker in Flamingorosa the advice Ofnow the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile your neighbors, you appreciate your partner, you will hear ballads, visit musicals, you use your phone, you talk, you say, listen, you agree to apologise.
Talk is better than silence, sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
" I completely understand what you are driving, " said Esme walnut with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, " and I say nothing other than that we are not yet effectively cured, as we are deluding ourselves into thinking.
My concern is that without warning, we may find, as we repeat the mistakes that led only to WHAT GESCHEHEN IST, WHEN ES GESCHEHEN IST.
This time, however, it is not the other, we miss our anger and distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz moulded by the hands of a pyramid.
In order to indicate a patience.
" They go too far, " he said, " if you call acts as a " mistake " our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you say that they have their "anger" and "mistrust" of "other" omitted.
It should not really be necessary, someone in your position to remind us that we are in understanding of the past, such as the protection of the present, not in terms of ' us ' and ' other '.
There was no "us" and there was no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
" If we are honest with ourselves, " Esme dared to post " no part of the society can claim to have behaved well.
I would accuse anyone.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - we are all agreed on that.
And, just as it must be assigned no blame, no guilt has to be repaid, if such a repayment would be appropriate, and if there is a way to repay them.
But what is the past, if we do not learn from this -
The past is that we forget about them.
If I may say something about this -
Luther Rabinowitz did collapse of his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said, and dismissed them.
The next day, when it went to work, it was hit by a motorcyclist, who was described as passers-by, in a kind of "brutal rage" drove on the footpath.
There are coincidences.
