Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched study.
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
A figure over 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders have fallen and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures prior to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the Bank to a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, during this week could provide such information, whether it is a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, are the deterrent impact of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months, with 51.4.
In the meantime, fell in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI to 46.9.
France remains a concern, as well as the descent of Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are also not reassuring, " said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Good news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August, is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: " producers in the eurozone's life are obviously very difficult, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine, uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably means that some orders are being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.
He said that it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
