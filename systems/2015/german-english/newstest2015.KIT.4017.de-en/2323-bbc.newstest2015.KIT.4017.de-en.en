"Pig" in Ipswich is listed for sale
The picture of a house for sale by estate agents, as it became clear that there was a large pig that had made it in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is on a private street in Ipswich and retails for £ 120000.
Among the details included a picture of the living room of the house - which also included a pig that his head nestled on a sofa.
Estate agents Connells said the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was mistakenly released and has since been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
The exposé of the house described Connells, the former house of assembly as a "unique detached house with one bedroom."
Although the broker's image has been removed from the site, it still appears on promotional material.
The house was for sale of interest in social media, when some wondered whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
