Judge temporarily halts law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force closure
A US federal judge temporarily stopped on Sunday, the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June, on the law and will enter into force on 1 Sep, doctors who perform abortions, force to acquire a patient admission in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
The decision of the judge, however, means that doctors can temporarily still legal abortions, while they apply for such a right.
The law, "the plaintiffs can continue, while trying to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, scheduled a hearing for the judge to a more permanent decision on the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and said that doctors win more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women want to avoid a devious law in Louisiana, their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for reproductive rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment to the doctors from the two clinics, which are not connected to the lawsuit, and also had applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, but courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas, the majority of the remaining clinics in the state have been forced to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association that permit demand the rights of doctors to unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has Patienteineinweiserechte, shared with the center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state to be forced to perform any abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out of fear for his safety, the operation, the group said.
In their arguments against the verdict, said representatives of the state of Louisiana, that they would not punish doctors because of the performance of abortions, while their applications for Patienteneinweiserechte were still pending.
