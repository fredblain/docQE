Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement is a surprise, not because nobody had expected an acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as though the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion, and the cooperation was also, of course.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, "a YouTube for live games," says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let us play," a video genre, a painting of secret science theatre in salving the (usually older) games, are already very popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube would buy Twitch, a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery as to why the deal with YouTube was not derailed, because the company is reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we know about at the moment, this statement is Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "we chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
Am going to like me, who say that they prefer to play sports as a watch, it is hard to understand the attraction, which assumes that watching other games to even the control console.
It is one thing, a friend at 3.00 a.m. to look over the shoulder, while it creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to a spinner poke it 20 times in succession in Call of Duty is shot in the head.
You could just look at all these games.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so it can be to watch it without its own control over the prospect of a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick passes, the Roger Bannisters in our electronic age whole games in record time, entertaining.
But as long as not a game or humor virtuoso is his Twitch channel is probably not as interesting.
But what skeptics know as I have of it?
Twitch is called 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video is integrated, such as YouTube, Twitch would have simply swallow.
But Twitch has something any company would like: thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said that Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of a contraction, not yet - schluck - as a spectator sport.
