Among the top; unqualified
We showed a huge strain on our puzzle task of the summer series "my slice of the Rhöner happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees, there are still in the county, the specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy one footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It is past Foals are separated, Basaltsteinhaufen and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A little below the quarry from Bauer Berg, a mile north of the road to Weis Bach, as it is.
The Vital looks natural monument, it towers over the other trees in the area, and is reminiscent of an American sequoia with a volume of over eight metres.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive searches, there were only hints of the names of origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheim archive, and older people from Unterweißenbrunn consulted to find out what Bewandtnis with Geißruheiche.
His findings remained fairly mundane explanation for the name.
Accordingly until about 80 years ago, their animals, the goat herders from Unterweißenbrunn from the laboriously cleared and freed of meadows.
At the foot of the tree by the rise of weary animal guardians should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because the actual goats grazing herds.
The area has been declared in addition to the core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has been discovered.
Upon entering the stone collections but you should be careful, because the basalt heated by the sun, is also a popular haunt for Cross otters.
A trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but there is a hidden.
Other routes are marked, the direction Hochrhön climb and invite you to take a long walk.
Where is the water castle?
A moated castle, which is looking at our next task, but it is rare to find.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district, which could fit the building portrait.
Where is our "share of the Rhöner happiness"?
