Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis for many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another illness.
They really suffered from the Charcot-Marie-tooth disease (CMT) - a group ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that the misdiagnosis is a common problem in humans with CMT, because so little is known about the disease.
Some 23000 people in Britain probably suffering from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders, such as muscle weakness, an insecure and curved toes.
Ill also suffer from feelings of industrial or pain, the disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms become worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that they suffer from Fried rich-ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair, before they were 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: " as a child, I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell backwards and everything took longer for me.
I could never go with the other children roller skaters or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and to run geh√§nselt.
Rodgers said that she realised at the age of 13 years after several operations to discharge her Achilles and stretching their legs, their medical records, when her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty, because I was curious, so I have told anyone, but I went home, looked after the disease in the library and wrote to the FA," she said.
When I received reply, I was shocked and dreadfully in panic.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and 25 die, and would slowly lose all my skills.
I did it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she realized that their skills had not declined as much as they had imagined and inquired of her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not think that you have it, otherwise you were already in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what was CMT, I felt as if I have a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month to draw attention to the disease.
