Matthies says: high time for the big networking
Given the galloping technological progress, which threatens our cosy home in high-tech halls of our columnist Bernd Matthies can console themselves with a very familiar electronic accessories.
While I am writing this, my view of the Spiralkabel that connects the phone to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But behind it there is a thought: if the cable would not be flying in the shortest time of all listeners herrenlos in the house, and that would be significantly more retro.
Already applies in the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typos: electronic) sector, the rule is that the world premiere of today is the electronic waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And who still has a tube TV in the living room, for example, it simply says that he categorically refused television.
Why is this thinking?
Because the Andr√§ngen of Ifa on radio tower this week our absolute incompetence in electronics.
The layman, previously a washing machine and CD players dominated blind today do not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread with incredible eitlem experts speaking before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Healthcare and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yes, it is yet?
What should we talk to people who voluntarily apparently such Quark spread?
In fact, it is for some 20 years, above all, that we should let our house.
So even reordered the yoghurt so that tells us the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives that burns in the office.
And would it not be wonderful if we in the office of the air conditioning in our early arrival...?
Yes it does, however, an air-conditioning.
But a dream will certainly soon be true: we will save our watch, say loudly "suck!" - and at home, the Staubsaugroboter.
Misleading.
All amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "the boundaries between white and brown goods blur," raunt an industry insiders, you can connect the washing machine with headphones, the Dampfgarer sends the weather report and data glasses indicates how long does the pizza in the oven, but what is pointless, because we are in a traffic jam.
From the daily practice, we also know that if a neumodisches device really is urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the Spiralkabel will survive the next radio shows on the phone.
