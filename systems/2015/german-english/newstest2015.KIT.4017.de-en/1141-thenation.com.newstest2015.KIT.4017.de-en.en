Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The congressmen, Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions, die, die, the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
I am so proud, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee Erm√§chtigungsgesetz.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of trade unions - as with other forms of discrimination, and stops as anti-trade union-minded forces.
The supplement to the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for discriminating against NHS workers to organize a union representation to sue in a civil court for justice, and to obtain damages or criminal money - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understanding what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, which have been subjected to the unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have encouraged countries all over the world to recognise labour rights, and to expand.
There was a time in which millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
When the United States after World War II Germany occupy pushed General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff, the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans have a clause that explicitly testified: " the right to form associations in order to safeguard and improve the health and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and each profession or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void; seeks to measures are illegal.
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests, or to join them."
For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries how to forge civil and democratic societies, told Americans that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and protected - that this union will take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies should be allowed.
Once these rights in America came under fire, it is actually very wise, the American ideal of that working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., 50 years ago said:
The story is a great teacher.
All now know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people work miraculously created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history is preserved.
History remembers, and we should do the same.
The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the rights of citizens as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers ' representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America made in the past, and the promises of democracy.
