Hong Kong, China denied the right to choose government protesters swear vengeance
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections by 2017, the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach probably fired long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists planning and mobilization to within a few hours after the announcement began.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows basically Communist leaders reject all candidates loyal to Beijing.
"It is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, said Li Fei, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the approval of public nominations for the elections for the Hong Kong government to "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain created the control over Hong Kong, the Chinese, Beijing has promised that the inhabitants in 2017 to choose the presidency of government.
The Chinese leadership's decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it is the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also demonstrates that the Chinese leadership, the process by a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing firmly in the hands.
After a new clause should be allowed to be the only candidate "with a love of country and love Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most efficient public protests in Hong Kong took place for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district, if Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening had gathered within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central's supporters in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest planned in the coming weeks.
They did not give details, however, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers disclosed that the movement has " the occupation of the central district of only as a last resort taken into account, an action which would only take place if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to have to say today that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for days, and were on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures, including police and barricades.
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services.
Moreover, there is growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests, which they could talk to a lot of economic harm, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, which has long been critical of the movement.
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the voting rights, which was attended by 780000 people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands in one of the largest democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region.
