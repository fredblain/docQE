The Höllenjahrzehnt of survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the horrific siege of the school, as the tide of children still suffer.
Ten years ago, were taken hostage more than 1000 people from Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims, who were unaware of the death of bestiality in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists, children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new school year, captured and killed, it seemed like the Böseste of evil.
The tragedy united the West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims, who were unaware of the death of bestiality in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of these terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Their best hope?
The war, the Ukraine is now - and the children as they die - now comes to an end.
The girl who was shot in the attempt, in the zerschossene school sports hall zurückzuklettern
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she was only in her underwear tried in the zerschossene school sports hall zurückzuklettern after a mine exploded.
Totally confused Aida was looking after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were left for dead, but they survived.
"One woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," Aida said.
My legs were overrun.
I stood up and climbed back in again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations, she was completely healed, but yesterday said: " three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I must be performed again.
Some Granatsplitter are still in my knee.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people, as it has been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but I was not broken," says tear.
" That is what happened to me, and it is not going to change.
Once a year, I am always in the gym, to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
" I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and started my career.
To have a family, I am thinking later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of every year is a bit weak.
I am glad that many people around the world to remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of me, as I see in the school zurückklettere, I think that many people, it is the first time to understand our disaster and help ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled the bullets, believing that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to the school) for 7 years and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "mama told me that I should lie down, if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "run."
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and was on the way a toddler wines, it took in the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, his son outside in the arms, said, " Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, was Tamara stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in the belief that her son died.
After its reunification, she said: " I wept with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to get the title of Barnardo's, Children's Champion by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
"This horror you every day, but I wish I could stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is in my memory.
I remember that I am directly after all my toy guns wegwarf.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes, and that is no problem for me.
" I am not afraid to go back into the gym, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the yard, and they have not managed to get out.
We never say that they were killed or are dead.
We are saying that they remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he has suffered anxiety to place such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends.
You followed this horror every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer the atrocities," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
I am so happy to help.
One day I will go to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the training academy.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: " 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children, and run around, and the silence lasted for many months.
She can still vividly recall their trip to London with Damir.
The people of London, when I told our story.
At the time, I understood how people understand our feelings on the other side of the world, and to show their support.
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could ring Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting me, her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all of the local Russian restaurants.
I remember when he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot with his water gun on her and she ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British are so willing to share our pain and supported us.
She said: " I always think that the world has not improved in those 10 years.
In Ukraine, there is a war now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and still be killed.
These are precisely such as our children.
I think that for many of the war, some of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I know just what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles.
When he was small, he suffered - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, his face away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all of its weapons and other military toys, Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure that he is dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and was on its feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with around the body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could possibly have survived in this hell.
" I remember that I shouted at him, " Damir, Run, Run away, " but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he ran away.
And so is the life, unlike that of many others, for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege, the symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Consolation: the Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother, Fatima, after the siege in 2004, right, a picture of Georgy today
His blutüberströmtes face was scarred by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had sacked him for his first day of school before she ran in her older son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and then my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives, but they were all killed.
My Georgy only managed to survive.
As the date draws nearer, the harder it is to remember and talk about it.
There is no single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days myself.
No one will ever forget it, I promise you that.
Urgent: the image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized (right) as the statue.
I remember that Georgy on that day was so keen to go to school, he said that he wanted to hug his trainer.
I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of a weeping Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world to feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Georgy said today: " it is important that such a thing can never happen again.
" I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
Investigate the people keep such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they investigate the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is becoming a little horror.
" I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but by then it was better.
I went back later in the year 2004 to school and I had every day fear.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.
That is why I am always in the sports hall when the 1 September gets closer.
I want to pay tribute to my my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I am not going to forget it, but I am not bemitleide.
My life goes on.
I have completed this year, the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I am going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow this to happen.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it is not going to happen.
Georgy Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, although he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB, the intelligence officer, but could do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing that I have left behind me.
Now I am older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I must say that that is not true.
" In 2006 I worked with psychologists and then felt something better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - a year later, was the first and only time I went back into the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return, and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.
Physically I am fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the secret service, the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my documents, including the medical and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have already two years behind me.
He has been studying the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: " I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer, of course.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: " the pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations of the commemoration.
I know that Georgy will not go.
There is much more violent for him because he was there and I do not.
I waited at home for him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, all of them are painted in Beslan.
It is in us.
Georgy is now an adult, but the horror is still in it.
It is hard to accept that if something is so Unfaires happened to her.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but he cannot attend because of his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but not to participate in sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never be entirely overcome that and forget.
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
I have lost many of the people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God gave me, but my heart cries for the killing.
I know of families where children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want that.
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What these people are fighting for?
Why they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People are suffering and children, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine have been killed and many more.
If we could only throw all these rebels and - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby that was so bluntly by a Special Operations Command in security
Rescued: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian special-ops commando (left).
It is now ten (right) and remembers nothing of the atrocities
The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists did they go, but kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister, Kristina and her brother Makhar in their cruelty in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan has since married again and with his new wife Svetlana, a little girl that he had called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbours.
"Now they are a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
