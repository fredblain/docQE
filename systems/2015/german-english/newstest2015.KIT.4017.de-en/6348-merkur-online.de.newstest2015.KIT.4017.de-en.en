Finally, there has been disagreement between the two wolf Council Hauser castle.
Now the executives to think about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the wolf Council Hauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Council of Wolf Hauser castle friends, the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends.
Seemed very different positions so far, as with the history of the wolf council houses and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two sides together: it should soon be held talks on a common approach.
This confirms the club executive Torsten Sjöberg (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (friends) to demand of our newspaper.
"I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again," says Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together in the future.
So are quicker to visible results.
While the castle for the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest in the eye, stands for the Association for Sjöberg ' unlocking and Erlebbarmachung " of the site.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle of friends, was very pleased by its own account of the call.
He is the castle of friends since Dimbaths death.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
Currently, the association, according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have the first association activities out of respect." This "theory" was needed to "consider how we might proceed."
According to Piffl is the new chairman will be in the conversation with the club.
Meanwhile, the castle of friends could also make a current mood within their group.
A candidate for the presidency, there is not yet, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find" and he will not run because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses.
The Tölz wants to continue to participate in the project "but very happy."
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction in the eyes of Piffls seems to be in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France, would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
By a large number of the people, and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: " I was skeptical at the beginning.
Over time, but I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. " It could be a " USP " for the Flößerstadt.
Here, there is nothing else.
In addition, the project by EU grants, coupons and potential sponsors would be financeable, believes Piffl.
"The idea of reconstruction, I personally do not throw away." He hoped that the castle club might move on this point.
Their goal is to document the story first, "is important and good."
Then we could see further.
