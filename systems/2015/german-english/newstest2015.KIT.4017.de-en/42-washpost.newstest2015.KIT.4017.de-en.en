The tax burden of business people in the Washington area is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers and more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the accelerated economic recovery, a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the region District, Maryland and Virginia, jointly paid $27.6 billion in state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of the company rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining Opinions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose to more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the Center for National tax, a tax policy group of the Services agency Ernst &amp; Young.
More than half the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue of Maryland from companies.
Virginia, with 28 percent, the lowest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery of the real-estate values of the companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in the real-estate values is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue in Maryland, as the real estate taxes to barely more than a fifth of the amount of tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland is the following: a large proportion of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely, for example, more on income taxes, in order to offer the same services that other countries.
The recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate earnings also appear to recover, the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations from $2.3 billion, compared with 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took a $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, rising evenly to the local tax burden on companies is not at all three locations.
The Anstiegsrate in the District was at 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia, reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas of the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland stands at 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes and generally a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study of the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages of Virginia, is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues its revenue targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state of up to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems better to go to small businesses in the Washington area, and so they pay more state and local taxes, so the recent study.
Corporate taxes paid by small business and personal income taxes - a transitional structure, organized according to the most small businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a sharp faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes in the country are likely to persist this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period of the previous year.
However, the region could lag behind Washington, if the spending cut in the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region.
