Israeli children are returning after the war in Gaza in their schools
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip on Monday, returned to the schools, after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while rockets and mortar shells on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas went down, and the schools in Gaza remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school brought the launch of rocket no bullet holes drawn communities in the south of Israel, a sense of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod remote staff "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, before the arrival of the students Granatsplitter from the walls and sliding walls.
"We have a little bit scared, but excited," said Ronit beard, someone who lives on the Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we are not out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire to the war last week, remained cut off to thousands of residents of border communities such as Saad in their homes or left their homes to escape to safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still hesitating to return.
The Ministry of Education, said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were housed temporarily in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily scarred from the Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to learn a lot and said, "we will ensure that bought their knowledge and offer security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a unbefristeteten cease-fire.
The ceasefire provided for an immediate end to the fighting; important issues remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas after the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarming of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
In the war, more than 2100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies those claims and estimates that at least half of those killed are militants, but no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting against Israeli towns, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250000 people sought refuge, which has been converted into temporary refuges in more than 100 UN schools.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues, the education authorities last week delayed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will soon be reopened, so that we can learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy, who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
