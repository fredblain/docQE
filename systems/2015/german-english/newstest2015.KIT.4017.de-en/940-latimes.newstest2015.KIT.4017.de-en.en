Putin calls for the inclusion of Kiev "statehood talks" with the eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government to stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly to negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin had not meant that the territory under the control of the separatists in eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia, but that his status to Ukraine should be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region of the power of representation of its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, fits the strategy pursued by him since the start of the riots five months ago, apparently: aid for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West.
In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the territory known as the "Novo Rossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the Ukrainian politicians, campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt. and while government groups to attack civilian communities in the rebel-held areas are hoping for early peace talks "are caught in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organisation of society and the state status of the South-East of Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the wider autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin's spokesman on the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far more difficulty to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys before the conflict, a broad majority in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations, and the Kremlin has de facto control of a territory that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, and an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, the major components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections, amendments to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas will be given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, arming and Moscow is accused of incitement.
Putin's last call on Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders, followed after another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region invaded the eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, the first step in a campaign for the takeover of the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations under way to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and a narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are now at a point where there is a point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided to any concrete actions, the leaders demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian columns of tanks and 1000 soldiers invaded last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the beleaguered separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were delivered by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk included, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers on Ukrainian territory captured a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
