After election in Saxony, the CDU Vice Strobl, NPD-ban question procedures
In light of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, the CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl called for an end to the current NPD-ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to the CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl should the ongoing proceedings to ban the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also a CDU president in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD was scraped in the vote on Sunday in the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003, because of the constitutional protection was also in the NPD's top informants.
In December 2013, the Federal Council filed a new request after long preparation in Karlsruhe, Germany.
German government and parliament joined.
