4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action-cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for about $300.
I have these photos in a family with several cameras, which are all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are locked.
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording modes, which optimizes exposure for the twilight these quickly underwater conditions.
And before you jump into it, you look up in the depth of your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only permitted for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.

Take multiple shots - because many of them will not work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCD, with which you can compose images, action-Cams normally does not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the correct attitude is a matter of luck.
So you make many shots.
If your camera has a terraced mode, with a series of recordings with slightly different exposure settings, you use it.
Stay near the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, you remain so close to the surface, when you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.
You can also be more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you see color.
Go close to the objects.
It is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the bad lighting conditions.
It is especially important if you are working with an action-cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have dense to your objects, if they are to fill the entire picture.
