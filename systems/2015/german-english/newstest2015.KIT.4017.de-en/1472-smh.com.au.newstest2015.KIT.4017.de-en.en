The house prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital, rose in August by 1.1 percent, the RP Data on Monday.
This increase, the overall increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price rise was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the rise in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne drive a two-tier market.
The figures from RP Data show that house prices in Sydney last year rose by 16.1 percent, in contrast, Melbourne 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending and where the prices of the year rose by only 1.4 percent.
Mr Lawless said that now, with spring beginning in the next few months, a rise in the property for sale would be to see that the market " a real test.
"If you look at the continued high rate of auction prices, generally fast Verkaufsrate and persistently low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
