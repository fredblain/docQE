"The Expendables 3" played by Sylvester Stallone, less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the US, while "sin City: a Dame to Kill For" album only 12 million dollars of its budget of $70 million.
The tailored to Cameron Diaz film "sex Tape" played on the opening weekend, only $14.6 million, while children's films like "tame dragon made easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films and described "tame dragons made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
In films for a slightly older audience, however, it appears as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaS core and Metacritic rating for each summer film start between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013, and in the current year to at least 2000 screens.

Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios is that it is too much focused on film versions of comics, and predicted a "meltdown" in Hollywood.
Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could indeed contain a kernel of truth.
In view of the expected in the summer of 2015, a potential blockbuster, including Aven Gers: age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, however, are more optimistic, the other representatives of the film industry.
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in the cash results than simply "cyclical" and said to the Hollywood Reporter: "the next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema box office, and no one will worry more about the business."
