Lenny Henry: my father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and her relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born out of the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with a lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" treatments after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: " stop with the crash.
Leave your sister alone.
Beweg you!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - which were already grown up when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, or the beauty of cricket.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, it was this serious guy in the corner of the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into what life was like for him.
It is a little brighter now, but they are dark, quite smoky, deep stygische mazes with Flammenstößen and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father, earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him was growing.
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ' expressions of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when it came to my mother at the end of their lives badly, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he had as a child is missing.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
But listen to me!
Dad, I am 22!!!
With Dawn French.
Why should not we be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still with her French friends, with whom he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should not we be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said " you have to be radical.
So I went through this exercise thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one wants to eat carrots.
Henry's career change, perhaps reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello, he was captured by the theatre.
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then, after some of August Wilson.
That is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
He started with only 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he people imitation and wrote about it on New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s, "I was looking for a fairly long time, the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He learned at work.
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an efficient jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star of television, and it was really difficult.
Lenny on New Faces in 1975
As his manager, the right of the Black and White minstrel show, a light entertainment programme, in which the people, "black anmalten", Henry continued his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
Somehow, I just wish that it would never have happened, but I do not think I have done it.
It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But these "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
With the introduction of characters, the British black culture, both as celebrated, Henry worked in the 1980s in an alternative comedy circuit.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on show in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series boss!.
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "what are you doing next, Len, because it feels everything as you only time rum or stomp on a bit."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4, titled What is So Great About...?
The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never been properly at school learned something about him and kept him mostly for a domain of middle-class whites in tights and a cabbage front.
So I had a great fear of it.
All of us who interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, " you should try it.
Do it not bad, if you do not know what you are talking back.
Put a few of the words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone gave me the head finally set up properly.
" This is what it is, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, your text, recherchiere a bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece of months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just did not happen.
And soon, he appeared in the comedy of errors.
I was suddenly in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, " oh, you have changed. " "
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me," now you have to fill 10 minutes while they fix the computer. ""
Instead, the stage director, announced that the idea would resume as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "oh, thank God."
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a theatre piece, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
The text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.
It also sold well, so it is like a big plate of the gods, I say ' this is your destiny. ' "
He says that, of course, with a DONNERNDEN voice.
So I stand by it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is redolent of humorous outbursts, while he repeatedly imitated.
I have decided to make no stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate satisfaction that somehow from a room full of strangers is dangerous.
If you are looking for the perpetually, before a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo when I was ready, but overall, there is not as much as before.
I ask him whether he will ever again be a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun that I have in a room with a director who is helping to shape a beginning, a middle and the end of a journey - I do not think that I would ever give up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I am quite an actor.
It is fun.
You can always tell a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
