Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, whose character things changed, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
As an advisory Anästhesiearzt devoted his career to save the health of both the agony of the disease, as well as the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalled, was an MI6 staff, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important in the diagnosis and disease, while the cases are mostly occupied with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, but he was the one whose ordeal began.
"I have not felt," he wrote in May of this year.
I had to take our stuff.
While he fought with the flu like symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
"I want everything immediately, rather than later," he quoted.
As Juliet for a week was on a business trip, Lawson felt quite unusually, worried and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The result was the X-ray examination.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, the lungs überziehende skin.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is usually difficult to determine.
For example, some smokers with lung disease, have not been previously all lung cancer sufferers are smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber construction, which was once seen as a "miracle material" but has now been recognized as lethal.
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous use has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily to use it.
Even where it was used, only people working in certain sectors directly with the substance, plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, he seems to be little concern.
But such complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is enjoying the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain
The reason why we now see the deadly effects, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999, banned all types of asbestos), is that a mesothelioma emerged only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still exist in the houses, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we buy.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions and age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Also in the hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, have already been identified as the starting spots in this deadly Karzinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
It was indeed hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if, in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was six years of my education, a lot of asbestos." He wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and guard - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question, at least in part.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and the diseased in mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one is still alive."
How many of us will fall ill?
With Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma sufferers die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "how many of us are ill?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to be stalling, 90000 of the disease will be a victim.
Most of them at the moment have no idea that they are going to die.

A quick look at the files of the courts, which are often the victims for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms already is.
In June this year, Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, Janice Allen negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M &amp; S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
" Before this, " she says, " I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.
I never thought that I would get this.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It has been used for roof panels, floor plates, Rohrisolationen, boilers, insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential casualties.
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's biggest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high rates of mesothelioma."

Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical mesothelioma victims, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of the stakeholders in the argument that "a significant proportion of the Mesotheliome without known suspension was caused by work or in the home, presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts, his words, based on the "normal use and aging" of our building.
It appears that no one could expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government, have been unwittingly exposed to the substance might be.
Goddard, 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind the committee rooms of the Parliament, whose lethal fibres could be something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Parliament members are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the principals of the Parliamentary work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "clean health certificate," it is now clear that £ 1 billion of work has to be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations, and to remove the asbestos, and that the MPs after the general election in 2015 will take rather in nearby QE2 Conference Centre on the green benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
Everything you can do now is wait.
A person who could never determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson believed the 50-year-old Abbott, that he was during his work in hospitals exposed to asbestos.
" I have worked in a hospital, where asbestos claims have been decidedly positive, " he says, " but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they worked and the data.
What he remembers distinctly the day at the beginning of December 2009, in which he was a kind of fever.
He was 45, and was leading late in the evening by surgery.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought, no longer to create the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs.
But as Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He went a month not to work.
Verwunderte doctors made X-ray pictures of his chest and put Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health has slowly improved, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, the symptoms returned, however, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
In 2011, Abbott's was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott is not with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older, and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's deteriorated state and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray photographs of a group of experts.
In December 2011, two years after Abbott was ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the ribs and chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go, " he says.
To be honest, I had not much to worry about.
But Rachel, my wife was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosis
Suddenly, Abbott appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
Only now he realised the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in large public buildings, where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.
And so mesothelioma is younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who came in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another alternated (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate (as Graham Abbott often did), most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It shows that over several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He is still today.
Students displayed their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was used due to its fabulous insulating and flame retard often in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
It also applies to schools.
Indeed, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Across the country, thousands of hours of Chemistry, pupils have their bunsenburner parked on asbestos mats.
On websites frequently raised the issue of asbestos in schools now.
And meanwhile have so innocent objects in our homes as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our property," commented Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact was a woman, the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s.
So beware how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move on, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.
I was two weeks ago in practice.
Then I knew that I could go and I had to take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the fresh approach from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
As countless patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information, with whom he has had to cope.
"It was very difficult to absorb it all," he says.
" " I asked my doctor how long I have? "
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, ' Well, I will not see another Christmas.
It was then. ""
Mesothelioma is a particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that is causing the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
If the tremors of asbestos and the fibres are inhaled, they can fix the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin cells and can cause mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax-doctor moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.
It is the hospital of the Andrew Lawson believed that it was exposed to asbestos, it is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely during their training in hospital exposed to asbestos.
Once the asbestos needles the lung tissue, says Treasure, " they will be pushed to the edge of the breathing process, where the skin is.
Inherently it is invasive right from the start.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
Some say that it was worth a try.
The Treasure said no.
"You can't cut out the chest hairs," he says.
They are not concerned with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "is not very well to chemotherapy," the "effect", but not cures.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fighting.
After he had mesothelioma contacted Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis was a one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.
"Hello, cancer," he was merrily on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott originally been offered to six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life expected just a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, was "to make things in a more positive light."
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage that I had to be referred, I phoned up and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and must wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma-sufferers to be able to play the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually inevitably fail, there are many people from another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898, that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
But what has changed in the 1960s that it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, and in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation" as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
After the investigation, confirmed his death, a spokesman of the Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, it is for mesothelioma-sufferers, seeking compensation, it is a huge problem, the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job, usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who resist claims to know that it is time for them, but certainly not in line with the prosecutor.
In response, there were major new laws, it is easier for mesothelioma-affected, compensation for this, even if their former employers are no longer detectable in this year.
The law has a fund sponsored by the insurance industry £ 350 million for all those diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them could grant - about £ 120000.
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma-affected that £ 350 million is a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay when the time would not have been able to overcome it and mesothelioma-PLD companies and they could sue.
Also, Mike Penning, the former work and pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning as Morgan acknowledged that rapid action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day.
"The people are suffering so much and now need help," said Penning during the second hearing of mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At this point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After her first consultation recommended long-Lazdunski surgery, which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with a survival rate of long-Lazdunski over five years by up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is, of course, with the most important thing," says Abbott.
This is apparent in patients.
There is something that you can move on.
If you aufgibst, you very quickly deteriorate.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had in March 2014 a scan.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That is life, stumbling along.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no trace of the tumors is more visible.
But the process is both physically and mentally very demanding.
They need to think about practical things - on the money when I am not, for example, or how the Boiler time setting my wife works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward to.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
"For parents, it is difficult," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I have a disease, I would not be old.
They were very different.
Tamsin is very sociable and unpredictable.
They told their friends, and soon we got many calls.
Ellie was more circumspect.
She said not much.
Such talks are going through something that all cancer patients.
But for ill mesothelioma such talks are not of hope, not a shred of hope for survival.
The disease (as is ultimately for Stephen Jay Gould), a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, " mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
