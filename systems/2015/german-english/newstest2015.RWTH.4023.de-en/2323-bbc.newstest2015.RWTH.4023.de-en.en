"Pig house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by estate agents, when it became clear that it showed a large pig, which it had made in the living room.
The house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which was a pig that had his head on a sofa bed.
Estate agents said Connells, the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"However, the photo was published in error and has now been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
The exposé of the house, the former Assembly Connells described as a "unique detached house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the site, it still appears on promotional material.
The house was sold in the social media for interest, as some wondered whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
