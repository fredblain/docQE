Clever ways to save at university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1,000 a year, considered the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder a clever saving idea.
He invented a temporary system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation in order to delay the sale.
"My maths book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick - fil A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The college leadership said that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials for the students, however, that there were several cost-containment options.
Online shops and creative approaches such as Schroeder's are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The hiring of textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a considerably lower price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011.
Polls show the industry that was rented for about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Neebos Vice-President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are bought according to the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.
Here is the multiplication table for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books online cost only a third of the price they are in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of the "Annunciation" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used to buy
If the notes of others or make up a normal wear nothing, second-hand books are a good option.
"Annunciation" is used to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon .com 42 cents for a second-hand copy of "Strategic Business Media Fells: understanding The End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors, whether earlier editions.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.
In such cases, often older editions can be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, half .com, eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books at the end of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student could, for example, "rent" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the provisions of the shop where you can rent, including the penalties that may be incurred for writing notes, or usage.
Tenants beware: if you return the book, the penalties can exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
Instead of traditional textbooks, e-books are an option.
In fact, these books are sometimes hired by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon .com and Barnes & Noble Inc. Chegg is provided.
"Annunciation" at Chegg can rent for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals, which can be downloaded free of charge, while nowadays many classic scientific and engineering science textbooks can be very expensive.
In any case, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepper's Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price of books, because you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And an online order should be examined, and whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson the hard way.
He bought a book for four weeks and had finally paid the full price in the college bookstore.
