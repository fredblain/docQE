Berkeley explains housing again for "normal"
One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England, "returned to normal levels."
Homes in the capital were highly sought-after and subject to huge price increases, which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble in June led to put limits on mortgage loans.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the company, Berkeley said on Monday: "since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013," adding that this is a "stable environment" in action.
The housing market in London was set up during the downturn, as well as foreign buyers in the capital.
According to the official cadastre, prices have risen in the last year alone jumped by 18.5 percent, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling prices in Berkeleys private, cheap and student offers rose by around a fifth in the past year, and the end of April to £423,000.
A stronger pound has made in recent months, however, property in London less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them are also through the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "tax" has been deterred before the general election next May.
The London estate agents Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, presented in the tougher lending rules, also in the second half of the year would lead to lower market growth in both the property and prices.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showing a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the housing market cools.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already faltering Hauspreisbewußtseins.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London like Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, meanwhile, has fallen by a quarter year on year, so the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing, with the amounts due to date sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "the demand for the right, well planned product in the best locations remained stable, and as a result, the date sales have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent to £280 million per year, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that the revenues would be expected for Berkeley in the current year, the current market expectations.
The analysts estimate £450 million in annual pre-tax earnings.
Berkeley shares were fixed at £23.96 in the afternoon trading in London.
