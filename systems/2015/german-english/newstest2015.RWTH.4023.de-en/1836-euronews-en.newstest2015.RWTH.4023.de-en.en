Not all children return to school back in Ukraine
Schools opened almost everywhere in Ukraine on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Yatsenyuk Arsenij his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had opened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations.
The celebrations were held in September in every school.
The sky is not everywhere over Ukraine peacefully.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slawjansk who visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace is finally here, and that the children receive an education that they will be useful in life.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children embroidered shirts, balloons and flowers to pay their teachers.
