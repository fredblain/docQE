Merkel speaks to toll Word: "quite clearly"
Now the Chancellor once again clearly committed to it.
But it is not a licence for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU, the CSU wroth have against the car toll.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke after prolonged resistance from their CDU foot for the introduction of a car toll.
"Let me be very clear: it is in the coalition agreement, and they will come," said the party's top bodies on Monday after meetings of the CDU in Berlin.
But for now, Merkel has not presented a detailed model.
In the government program "certain parameters are black and red."
Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) have "made a proposal, and now will continue."
However, the NRW CDU insists on saying "no" to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) put constructively in the discussions on a bill.
On the subject, he spoke with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, as well as broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special." Schäuble on Sunday had left a "mirror" report Comments, his house, a separate concept to reward investors with highway tolls - after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer subsequently warned against the cabinet toll to develop concepts against the relevant minister.
CDU Federal Vice Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
"The coalition agreement was never assumed all round - and to charge," said North Rhine-Westphalia's CDU chair country.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer announced again now to talk about the issue.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU associations Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a local border traffic tolls to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had requested because of the toll criticism from the ranks of the CDU coalition loyalty.
The left sees the plans failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The toll is dead," said leader Bernd Riexinger Murks - the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a sticker on all German roads, to be launched in 2016.
Domestic car owners should not be burdened, according to the coalition agreement, but in addition.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll on the vehicle tax.
The model must not discriminate against foreign drivers but under EU law because of their nationality.
