The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions affected flights from Adelaide Airport
The SPRINGTIME has brought Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong wind that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 p.m., another 5 mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6 mm, which had already fallen on Saturday night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, turbulent showers, including a mold, which started just before 20 p.m., nearly 4 mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After the winter last week for an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to a maximum of 15.8 ° C.
The gusty weather probably led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19.30 p.m., but was hit by a wind shear - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at this stage in the Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off a second, and finally, at about 20.40 pm.
The flight delay led to delay some of the other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Hoschar flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, on Tuesday predicted a temperature of 16 ° C, with possible showers.
