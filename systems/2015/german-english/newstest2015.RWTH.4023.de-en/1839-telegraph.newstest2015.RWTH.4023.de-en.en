The BBC has found with Rona fair, perhaps the great director, it needs.
She meets with a proud glory, from the banking world, the media and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began in the global management consultancy Bain and Co., which they have moved to Morgan Stanley, the decoding of ICI and the media's.
She was seven years and resigned as chairman of the Financial Times, the top post of the parent company's to a younger male colleagues.
Their compensation was supposedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is solid.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when it was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
In May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The trust works in two directions: internally to the first guard on the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a full comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman, it would risk everything and increase an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he may bring himself to his job.
It is a difficult task.
As if this is not enough, many are interested to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status.
While the competition is threatening comfortable certainties of old and new technologies, the forthcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the largest media company in the world, certainly.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC rises back to the top of the scale of popularity: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The impaired vision and habits have changed for the BBC today: I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and significant institution.
It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found it.
