Genetic disorder often wrongly diagnosed
A British woman says that she thought that she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that they have to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with a disease.
She actually suffered Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of ererbter disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that the misdiagnosis is a frequent problem in people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an insecure and curved toes.
Also suffering ill feelings or pain. The disease is incurable, deaf and progressive, meaning that over time the symptoms are worse.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she was a rich - ataxia (FA) suffer - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought they were sitting in a wheelchair before 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "as a child, I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I constantly fell with me, and everything took longer.
I could never go with the other children, or skateboard and was often to go to school because of my kind and fun to run.
Rodgers said she realised at the age of 13 after several operations to relieve their Achilles and stretching their feet on their records, as her doctor had left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty, because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home, was looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA's society," she said.
When I received a reply, I was terribly shocked and got into panic.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair with 18 and 25 die, slowly and would lose all my skills.
I made it all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, she became clear that their skills had not fallen as much as they had imagined and inquired of their doctor.
He simply stood and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not believe that you, otherwise you're now in a wheelchair."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he told me what CMT, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
