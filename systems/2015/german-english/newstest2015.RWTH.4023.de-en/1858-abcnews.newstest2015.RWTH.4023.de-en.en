Perry says that Texas was not authorized derogatory tweet
A tweet from the official account of the Republican Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a disparaging remark about the democratic state district attorney who is at the heart of a criminal indictment against him for misuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another of Perry's account, the abstritt the previous.
Just a tweet was sent from my account, I was not authorized.
"I do not approve of the tweet and I have deleted it," it said in the message.
Employees of Perry responded immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry's official account, it was not clear who actually uses the feed.
In the previous tweet was an unfavourable image of the district attorney of Travis County, Rosemary, Berg, who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving.
Perry put a veto on a financial support of their offices, when they refused to resign, which could be an indictment of Perry - possibly 2016 presidential candidate - led to a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets: "I'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol level... But if I do, I accuse Governor Perry when he ausplaudert."
I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.
Clay's office was not entrusted with the leadership on the study of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistance requested by the judges, the prosecution of the case and argued that the law, which proceeded against the longest-serving governor in the history of the State of Texas, is the version according to diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the Public Integrity Unit of the state - which is based in Travis County and identified in cases of public corruption in Texas - refused to resign as a mud hill.
This veto was a public complaint by a leftist watchdog group.
Perry's official account is updated frequently and sometimes famous.
After completing the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012 as the fifth, Perry went on speculation that he will stop by posting a tweet a photo of a jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
