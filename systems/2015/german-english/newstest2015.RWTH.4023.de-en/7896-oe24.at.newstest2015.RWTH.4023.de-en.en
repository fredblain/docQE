Synomymous after second win of the season three th place in the table.
With the 2:0 on a grim week for Rapid, has taken a positive end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached with the training in the Europa League on Thursday between a deep.
"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," and the captain Steffen Hofmann, who confirmed the three th green and white.
Schrammel - Traumtor brings Rapid on season-opener Rapid has shown with the second season the right response to the disappointment of Helsinki and comes with a sense of achievement in the break.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, with its splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck asked in the 14th minute to set the course for victory.
"I thought I was up all the frustration of Thursday and schnalzte it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.
As Schrammel Novmember had taken on the 13th so far in 2010, the last time in a Bundesliga game, was for Ried.
The first championship match in Rapid Dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is something special, I am from the rapid generation," said Schrammel.
Due to the short-term basin - Blessur Schrammel Mario Pavelic, from the left to the right defensive side and also made it very well.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position as well.
He has earned the gate he has done several assists this year, "praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the flank of 2:0 by Hofmann after a hour, which finally made the decision.
Because before the guests could also write.
"Thank God we had some luck," said Schrammel, alluded to the divergence of performance and result in the last few weeks: "the results did not vote, but the Spielerische was always good in comparison to last year."
Barisic even found that "in many games before - was better than today," against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that despite the setbacks, the team structure intact: "my team has shown today that it has character."
Less pleasing for him: "we have finally played back to zero."
The fact that too much work while Sestak with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni, and Michael Schimpelsberger are multiple failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp be pushed to their Startelfdebuets, make the victory even more valuable.
"We must not forget that," warned Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who were very stable in recent times."
The play-offs should thus be used to "lick wounds and move up in the physical area a bit," said Barisic, who has five U21 - selection of players in its ranks.
One of the suits, perhaps, is captain of Hofmann's break.
It is for the team that goes beyond pain.
In this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "noted Barisic.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute, not only the structure, but also achieved the second goal.
For the 33 -year-olds, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 on Admira).
Hofmann: "must not believe that everything is good" "we have certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us, too.
Now it was high time, "said Hofmann.
But he warned: "we must see to it, not always black and white.
We have not played so badly in recent weeks, as has been stated.
We cannot believe that everything is fine.
The importance of its role in the team could not deny it.
It is a very young team, which I can help at the moment.
In certain periods, but to me, "said Hofmann.
The coach Michael Baur and his team had little.
He regretted the quick against Zaubertor hits "from the category," as well as the regular gate of utility in the 40th minute, which was denied by referee Koll Egger.
The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards Tor in some phases.
Since we have had too few qualifications.
Striker Maximilian Karner was similar: "it has just started badly, but then we have found and even made a gate.
By and large, would have been better.
