Production in the euro area on a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched study.
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and saw factories at a time of rising tension, between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery of the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further details later this week if he draws a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those who have been made by Britain and the U.S. during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, have become the restraining effects of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months, with 51.4.
In the meantime, the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a problem child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in key industrial machinery, as well as in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands are also not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.
The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
Good news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best thing that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro area in August, is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "producers in the eurozone find life difficult at the moment, obviously, since the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - continue to increase uncertainties in the difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably lead to some contracts being delayed or even cancelled, especially large contracts.
He said that it is "increasingly likely" that the ECB should launch a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."
