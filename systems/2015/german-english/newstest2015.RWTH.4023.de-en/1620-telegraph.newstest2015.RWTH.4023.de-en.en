Lenny Henry: my father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry, Rudy's Rare Records for a comedy, which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born out of the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended many "therapies" after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
We never saw his face, his voice only heard: "listening to the noise.
Let thy sister in peace.
LU2300!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket.
I have never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, read the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he gained an insight into how life was for him to be liked.
It is a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian maze with a lot of soot and smoke and flame surges.
My father used to be presented in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him has been greater.
However, Henry grew up as a child without the love of his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was ill at the end of their lives, we started, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he shared the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
But listening to hug me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is still friends with French, he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we not be friends?
It is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
When I was so very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.
So I moved this fitness thing through and had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be seen in his elegant, short cut.
Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theater.
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then, by August Wilson.
That is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he wrote to New Faces and imitation people about him.
His television career began in the mid seventies. "I was for a long time the only black imitator / comedian on TV."
He learned at work.
I had to be not just great in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I tell all the jokes could be an efficient machine, while I was a TV star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 New Faces
Since his manager had the right to stage the Black and White minstrel show, a light entertainment programme, in which the people "black," said Henry anmalten his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish somehow that it never would have happened, but I do not regret that I have done.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But these "years of award-winning light pillar of the British TV" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Through the introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and in the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought: "what are you doing next, Len, because it feels all the time, or only as you stomp on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned in school about him and held him mainly for a domain of the middle class, white tights and a cabbage in front of it.
So I had a great fear.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, said Judi Dench, "you should try it.
It is not bad, if you don't know what you are talking.
Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I was able to do this.
It was almost as if someone put me at the head.
"That is, it is a serious thing to take them seriously, and your text, a bit chaotic.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that simply did not happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "oh, you've changed yourself." "
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" you have to bridge now 10 minutes, while they fix the computer. ""
Instead, the stage director, announced that the idea would continue once the problem was solved.
I went to the stage and said something in me, "oh, thank God."
I am not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You are playing in a play, so stick to your role."
Henry, at the Duchess Theatre
The text was to learn for the ambitious.
Panic is very good, which strengthens the sinew.
It was also good, so it is like a big sign of the Gods, "this is your destiny." "
He says this, of course, with a DONNERNDEN voice.
So I maintain.
I love that.
I love being in a sample.
Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is criss-crossed by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of instant satisfaction from a room full of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you look at it constantly, from a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I wish to do so, but overall there is not so much as before.
I ask him whether he will ever make a stand-up comedy tour.
The fun that I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning, a middle and the end of a journey - I do not think I would ever give up.
So here is his new incarnation?
I think it is.
I am an actor.
It's fun.
It always tells a story, and that is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
