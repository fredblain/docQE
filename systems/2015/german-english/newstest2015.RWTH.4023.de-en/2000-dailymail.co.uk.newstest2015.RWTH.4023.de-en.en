The hellish year of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, such as the suffering of children today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan in Homestead.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific Beslan school siege, in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatical Islamist terrorists, children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new academic year, captured and killed, seemed to like the Boeseste of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later we have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome the resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue them forever.
Their best hope?
The war that has plagued Ukraine - and the children as they die - is now at an end.
The girl who was photographed in trying to meet the school sports hall zurueckzuklettern
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous, when she tried only in their underwear, zurueckzuklettern in the English school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Aida was completely confused after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both have been left for dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," said Aida.
My legs were bloodied.
I stood up and climbed again, to search for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of operations, she was healed completely, but said yesterday: "three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I must be operated on again.
Some shrapnel shards are still in my knees.
Their goal is to become a dentist to help the people, as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy has changed my life, but it has not been broken," she says pugnacious.
"This has happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
I always go to the gym once a year to remember those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together, when we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and my career will begin.
I think a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of every year something weak.
I am glad that many people in the world, to our horror, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
The online photo of me when I see how I zurueckklettere in school, I think that many people see it for the first time, our disaster and help to understand that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the bullets, in the opinion of his mother is dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go with 7 years in school) and survived the siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When, he said: "Mama has told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "run."
Terrified that it could be dead, he fled and saw on the way to a baby, it took at hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who completed his son out into the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara was stumbled outside and leg injuries in the hospital, in turn, on the assumption that her son had died.
After its reunification, she said: "I wept for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran and hugged me.
Damir was flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop the remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is in my memory.
I know that I then threw all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes, and that is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back into the gym, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the courtyard, and which have failed.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially in the toy shop, where I could choose everything I wanted, and the journey in an open top car.
But now he is afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.
"I am so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I am so happy to help.
I hope one day will go to the police and take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who were able to create and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people wept in London, when I told our story.
I then understood how people can understand on the other side of the world our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call and tell her own Cherie that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat borsch and they all cried local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water gun on them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so readily shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world is not better in these 10 years.
The war in Ukraine is now, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and killed.
These are precisely the kind of children like ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I know what these people simply feel that the whole horror.
And I can't stop it, to feel that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know that he does not like it, but he has six close friends from the class and sometimes they go into the gym and ignite candles there.
He suffered when he was small, including - I remember how he sometimes put on the sofa, turned the face of us for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I came to me after the explosion, and on its feet, I saw myself, and saw the hell around me, with all the body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
"I remember that I called him," Damir, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he ran away.
And so goes the life, unlike many others, for us.
Georgi Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege was a symbol of the horrors of Beslan
Consolation: the Beslan survivors Georgi Lyin with his mother, Fatima, 2004, right after the siege of Georgi today
His blutueberstroemtes face was marked by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first day of school before they rushed to get their older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
Not alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgi managed to survive.
As the date draws nearer, the harder it is to remember and to talk about it.
There is no single day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, I am constantly watching some scenes from these days.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
Urgent: the image of Georgi (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that wanted to go to school, so keen on this day. He said that he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.
And now there is even a statue of the weeping Georgi in San Marino.
Georgy does not look like the picture, and it is hidden at home with us on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Georgy today says: "it is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.
People constantly examine such tragedies and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
The horror of this world becomes something.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget about it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
Later in 2004, I went back to school and had scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the gym, when the 1th of September.
I want to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not sorry.
My life goes on.
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgi Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, even though he was caught at the feet of murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgi Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was captured in the hall and sat next to the bomb, which was mounted at the feet of murderous terrorists.
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it as if it were yesterday," says Georgi, who wanted to go as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am older now and people say that children can deal easily with terrible experiences - I have to say that is not true.
"I worked with 2006 psychologists and then actually felt a little better, but I cannot forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back into the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never go back there and please do not ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.
Philippa: Georgi Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about and they never asked me after school.
Physically, it is good to me.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my papers submitted to the medical and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals, from cats to cows. "
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experience.
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "this pain never leaves me.
In my soul, it is worse when the anniversary.
I will go to the celebration of the memory.
I know that will not go in.
It must be even more intense for him, because he was not there and I.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. All of them are here in Beslan.
It remains to us.
Georgy is now an adult, but he is still in this horror.
It is hard to accept that if something happened to be business-friendly.
He is a boy, he likes sport because of his knee, but he is unable.
He has been operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always follow.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only reinforces my pain.
I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the slain.
I know of families in which children were born, but also of widows who have never married.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if this is not.
I will never forget how I jumped in my heart when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
These people are fighting for what?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe this.
We were a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People are suffering and children, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed.
If we could only throw up all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which was worn so poignantly by a Special Operations Command in Security
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought by a Russian Special Operations command in security (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember anything about the atrocities
In 2004, the world held their breath as the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists thought they would go, but in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Since then, her father Ruslan has married again and with his new wife, Svetlana, a little girl that he called after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories, with the tenth anniversary of the dawn.
You will understand why.
