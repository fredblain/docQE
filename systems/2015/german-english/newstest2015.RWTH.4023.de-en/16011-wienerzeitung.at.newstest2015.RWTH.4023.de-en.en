Konstantin the ruthlessly honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, Konstantin alarm, singer-songwriter, pacifist, political activist, former prisoner, certainly, "monk and warrior" at 287 pages of paper.
Not chronologically, but more thought scraps of ideas, has written on 1 June 1947 in Munich, born in his memoirs, each chapter taken by an appropriate song.
And he is brutally honest: from Onanie during his high school to the shoplifting and drug use, it leaves no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Wide space, but also more abstract concepts: love, soul, ego, Being in the now, spirituality - all of which he is trying to go to the bottom in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explained his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how it has shaped not only the music (the opera lover became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has brought the ascetic monk, the high-living Konstantin alarm "by subtraction," as he says, "by omitting everything superfluous."
Between all the high spiritual views, there are brief anecdotes on the earth: for example, beatings in a busy restaurant, or a crazy car, which he envisaged as a tree.
Here, too, he is brutally honest.
