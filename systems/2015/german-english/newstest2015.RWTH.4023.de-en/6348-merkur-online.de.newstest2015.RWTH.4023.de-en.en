Pull back the clubs together?
Finally, there was always a dispute between the two Wolf Hauser Castle.
The bureaux now think about a possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf, Hauser was the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle friends, in the French Gu√©delon project.
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends.
So far, seemed very different points of view, how to deal with the history of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction.
The two camps now move closer together, it should be held soon to discuss a common approach.
This is confirmed by club CEOs Torsten Stockaryd (Castle Association) and Herbert Piffl (Castle Friends) to demand our newspaper.
"I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down with us," says.
In his view, all members of both clubs could learn to work together again in the future.
So there were faster visible successes.
While the castle had friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain, stands for the Association of the Castle, "opening and Erlebbarmachung" at the forefront of the terrain.
Herbert Piffl, second president of the castle friends, was on the call, according to their own.
Since Dimbaths death, he is the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September at a general meeting.
The association currently counts around 40 members under the age of 74.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have the first activities out of respect." This "thinking period" was needed "to consider how it could happen."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should go into the conversation with the castle.
Until then, the castle could make friends with a current mood within their group.
There is not yet a candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will be found." He himself will not be standing because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.
The new chairman should be a wolf Council.
The Toelzer wanted to "participate in the project but very happy."
The different positions in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects are already far advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
A high participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, be they a.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, more and more I have come to believe that it makes sense to promote the project. "It could create a" unique "for the raftsmen city.
Here, there is nothing else.
Moreover, the project would be financed by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction is why I personally do not want to throw overboard." He simply hope that the club moves on this point, perhaps.
The aim of documenting the story first, "is important and good."
After that, we could see.
