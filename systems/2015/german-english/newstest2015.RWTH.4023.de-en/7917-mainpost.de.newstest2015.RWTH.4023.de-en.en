Under this, there is a stillness
We showed a powerful tribe in our series "my piece of the puzzle for the summer Rhoener happiness" last Friday.
There are several of these giant trees in the county, the copy is the "Geißruheiche" above the white Brunn.
A bumpy walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It is past the piles of stone and basalt, basaltic rock seas.
A little below the quarry from the mountain, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, because it is.
Vitality provides the natural monument, it stands on the environment, and other trees with a volume of over eight metres to an American sequoia.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only references to the name of origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheim archives and interviewed older people from among white, to discover the explanation it has with the Geißruheiche.
His findings remained a rather sober explanation for the name.
Until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherd should have driven their animals from the white, from the laboriously cleared rocks and liberated meadows.
At the foot of the tree should have rested on the ascent exhausted animal guardians.
Meanwhile, the area has won back its importance, because actually, goats graze in the meadows.
The area has been declared in addition to the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has discovered.
Entering the stone collections must be careful though, because the rehashed basalt from the sun is also a popular place for cross otters.
A path leads from the white, to the tree, but something is hidden.
Other ways are signposted, the direction of Rhoen and invite to an extended hike.
Where does the Wasserburg?
An outing that is sought in our next task is to find the rare height.
The reflection in the trench is a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county, which could fit in the building.
Where is our "Rhoener piece of happiness"?
My piece Rhoener happiness
As with previous series of the Main Post in recent years to win it again this year prices, if they have the right solution.
Photographing himself, can also participate.
Under the e-mail address red.neustadt@mainpost.de, you can be the solution and also your personal "piece of luck" send Rhoener under this heading.
The best photos will be published.
