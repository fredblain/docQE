Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning: the online retailer and video producer, and a host of other things - Twitch buys the video streaming service for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of the Twitch video service from Google for a cool billion, and the cooperation also appeared.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their stunts, published in games, "YouTube for live games," says an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre, in which the know-alls (mostly older) give games a veneer of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is called often, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that wanted to buy YouTube Twitch, recorded a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal was not reached with YouTube, since the company was reportedly prepared to pay as much as Amazon.
Everything we currently know about this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "we have opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another mystery, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say that they prefer sport than watching, it is difficult to understand the attraction, which assumes the games rather than watching others to take even the control console.
It is one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 o "clock in the morning, while she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase, as he is shot 20 times in Call of Duty in the head.
Now you could see all these games.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the watch may be without its own control over the prospect of a really good view recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age in record time, all games are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or humor, virtuoso Twitch channel is not likely to be very interesting.
But what skeptics like me know it?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly into Amazon Instant Video, YouTube Twitch could easily swallow.
But Twitch has something that each company would have liked: thousands of young men who are courted by advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the media shows no signs of contraction, or even - schluck - as a spectator sport.
