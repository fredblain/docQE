Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, whose character changed things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.
He spent his career as a consulting anesthetist the task of the sick to avoid both the agony of the disease as well as the agony of the treatment.
Among his patients, remembers his wife, was a MI6 employee, who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the doctors are important diagnoses and diseases, while the cases mostly with something quite different: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who started his ordeal.
"I have not felt," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to pick me up.
While he fought with the flu similar symptoms, he noticed that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.
"I want everything immediately rather than later," he said.
When Juliet for a week on a business trip, felt disturbed by Lawson, unusually, and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to carry out a radiograph of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the radiograph was before.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, attacking the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers is usually difficult to determine the exact cause.
While some smokers with lung cancer, for example, have been previously diagnosed with lung cancer, not all smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger of asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material, which was once called the "miracle material" but was recognized as lethal.
For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that is easy to ignore.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type was not used in Britain since the 1960 s, when the industry voluntarily committed itself to not using this.
Even where it was used, only people worked directly with the material in certain sectors - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial risk material from another time, he hardly seems to be worrying.
But complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of Mesotheliomtodesfaelle since 1980 and likely future deaths in Britain
The reason why we see the deadly effects of asbestos for years now, even though it is illegal (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that after decades of a mesothelioma.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was and still is often found in the houses in which we live, the offices we work in, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And that is why mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limitations, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not protected.
The buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, have been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was difficult to imagine where he could possibly have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks as if the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos." He wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and porter - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same illness?
Unfortunately he was unable to answer this question, at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and in the last five years, mesothelioma patients," he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one is still alive."
How many of us will fall ill?
When Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long time.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
We can therefore only reiterate Lawson's question: "how many of us will fall ill?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, will be a total of 90,000 fallen victim to the disease.
At the moment, most of them have no idea that they will die.

A quick glance at the files of the courts, which often turn for claims, shows how widespread the scourge of Mesothelioms already.
In June this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, Janice Allen negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I don't really knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought that I would deal with it.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the concept of asbestos is a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform," a description of the fiber structure, which makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos is now by far the most frequently found asbestos in buildings.
It was on the floor of plates, pipe insulation, boiler insulations, used even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but by the EU and the WHO as a "great risk" with possible casualties.
More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "it's clear, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten."

Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual.
He presented a study of those affected, showing that "a significant proportion of mesotheliomia without well-known suspension was caused by work or home, presumably by asbestos exposure in the environment."
A large part of these contacts is based his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It seems that no one could expect to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government have been unknowingly exposed to the substance may be.
2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts were contaminated and pipes behind the committee rooms of the Parliament, whose deadly asbestos fibres could be caused by something as harmless as "strong" air movements.
MEPs are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it looks as if the opposite.
While the management of the Parliamentary Labor Service that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean" health certificate, it is now indisputable that must be raised to Â£1 billion over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election will meet members of the QE2 conference centre in nearby rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
A person who was able to determine the exposure to asbestos is never exactly Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott believed that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places where we worked, and to the data.
He still remembers the day in early December 2009, in which he got a kind of fever.
He was just 45, and led an operation by late evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought not to create the ride home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs came around.
But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He was not a month to work.
Doctors were surprised to see Pleurakathether x-rays of his chest and put fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
His health is slowly, and he returned to his job.
However, the symptoms returned from time to time, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
Abbott's 2011 came with similar symptoms a patient in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott is not his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection was clear in the case.
Abbott's condition deteriorated again in September 2011 and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after the first time Abbott had felt ill, introduced a camera equipped with a probe into the cave between the ribs and chest fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go, "he says.
Frankly, I had made so many concerns.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year's Day: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosis of mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom he recommended taking a lawyer.
Only now he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was spread very far, especially in large public buildings, which were often isolated pipes with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now become ill.
And so mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were more likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees, who alternated in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson), or in underground canteens (as did Graham Abbott often), most likely came into contact with toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war were hospitals for patients may be lifesaving, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.
It will still be removed.
Students showed their bunsenburner asbestos mats.
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Even schools.
Indeed, many people probably have had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, thousands of hours of chemistry students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.
The website is now often mentioned the issue of asbestos in schools.
And, meanwhile, have included innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or scales by default asbestos roofs.
"It is an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties," said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, was the only contact the women affected by the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970 s.
So you have to be careful how you tear off your garden shed.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to digest," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I did.
I was two weeks in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I will not see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change from the position of a doctor to the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he recalls how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come.
"It was very difficult to include everything," he says.
"I asked my doctor," how long do I have? "
And you gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "well, I will not see another Christmas.
That's it. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life conservation mechanism - breathing itself - is that caused the deadly cancer.
The majority of cases of mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.
If the asbestos is kicked up and the fibres are inhaled, they can in the breast skin, the skin around the lungs, set.
Asbestos fibres irritate the skin and can cause breast cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the needle of inhaled asbestos fibres," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart / thorax doctor, who moved in 2001 to the Guy's Hospital.
Just the hospital, which Andrew Lawson, that he has exposed to asbestos, is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and several others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in hospital.
Once the asbestos needles are pressed from the tissue, says Treasure, "breathing process to the edge, where the skin.
From the outset, it is inherently invasive.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
For example, the effectiveness of an operation is controversial.
Some say that it was worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
"You can't cut out the breast coat," he says.
They do not come with the knife around it.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well to chemotherapy," the "effect," but not cure.
"Sometimes there is a long time to live," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after Graham Abbott is still fighting its own diagnosis.
After he contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had four years after his diagnosis, an one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.
"Hello, cancer central," he said, happily on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott had originally offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which is expected to take four months and would prolong his life only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, was "the things in a more positive light."
Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski, heart specialist at the thorax Guy "s.
"We had an advantage because I had to be referred to, I just cried and got an appointment," Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma - sufferers, in order to be able to perform the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail, eventually, inevitably, many of those affected by another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960 s that recognized that was also a very low burden of a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma at Guy's was due to an asbestos exposure.
After the investigation into his death was confirmed by a spokesman of Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the basement area in the 1990 s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How can be removed asbestos
In fact, it is seeking compensation for sufferers of mesothelioma, an enormous problem, the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were significant new legislation this year, which makes it easier for mesothelioma - to enforce compensation, even if their previous employers are more.
The law has set up a fund of Â£350 million funded by the insurance industry for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could grant them - about Â£120,000.
About 300 successful applications in the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks that, like so many mesothelioma - Â£350 million a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if it ignored the time and mesothelioma patients - and they could sue the company.
Even Mike Penning, former labor and pension minister, admitted that the law "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action is needed in the face of seven deaths every day.
"The people are suffering so much and now need help," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
At that point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang - Lazdunski.
After their first meeting, Lang - Lazdunski an operation, which he expects in contrast to Tom Treasure, a positive effect.
This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with Lang - Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt stronger.
"This is, of course, the most important thing," says Abbott.
Time and again, we see in patients.
There is something that you can move on.
If you are going, you very quickly get worse.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.
After concern scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
That is not life-threatening.
This is lebensbeendend.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
No trace of the tumors is now more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about money when I am not, for example, or my wife, as the boiler works time.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look to the future.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.
"This is difficult for parents," he says.
It is difficult to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I would have a disease with which I would not grow old.
They reacted quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more circumspect.
She said not much.
Such discussions are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope, not a shred of hope for survival.
Finally, Stephen Jay Gould also brings the disease (as) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
