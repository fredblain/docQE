Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of all the state's five abortion clinics.
This measure of Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, was raised in June 1. The law, and should, in effect, would force doctors to perform abortions, including the right to acquire a patient at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's decision means, however, that the doctors can perform legal abortions continue for the time being, while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue, while trying to obtain these rights," wrote Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judges to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion supporters welcomed the decision, said the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, and that doctors have more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana, a law that they want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Centre for reproductive rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also covered the doctors from two hospitals, which have not joined the lawsuit and had also asked for the rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have introduced similar laws, but such measures have recently declared courts in Alabama and Mississippi for the constitution.
Cruxes of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and, as well as the American Medical Association say that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
Anti-abortion activists counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some of the effects of the closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has Patienteineinweiserechte, shared with the Centre for reproductive rights.
If all the other doctors in the state are being forced to carry out any more abortions, this doctor would not carry out the operation, fearing for his safety, said the group.
In their arguments against the judgment of the state of Louisiana, officials said that they would not punish doctors because of the performance of abortions, while their applications for patient rights, no way.
