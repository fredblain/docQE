The RHS chief horticultural adviser Guy barter, said: "container gardening, for example, is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants moving."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail figures due to rising home ownership and economic prosperity of the late 1980 s until the mid-90 s.
