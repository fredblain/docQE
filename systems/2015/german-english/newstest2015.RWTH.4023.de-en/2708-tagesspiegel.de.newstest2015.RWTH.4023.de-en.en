Ebola: West Africa's economy burdened the epidemic
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic puts a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rots in the fields, the mines are abandoned and orphaned the markets - the virus has afflicted the region difficult.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic one," the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we are losing a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sold on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Anyone who wants to buy food only comes on the market, or something to disinfect against Ebola.
Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, alone, fell victim to the fever of more than 600 people.
Health officials recently declared that the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
A total of more than 1500 people have died, thousands more are stuck in.
Draw employees from foreign firms
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put companies out of business.
Foreign companies such as ArcelorMittal, the steel industry and their employees, several international airlines fly to the affected regions.
Also, the local traders and farmers respond: only a few merchants still leave their homes in order to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the rot for the export of major cocoa and coffee beans in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People are travelling less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, usually goes on the market and sold his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population gets so directly the consequences of the epidemic and urgent: food is scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice.
At the same time, the threat of damage - a region heavily dependent on international firms with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies avoid the area for a long time, basically, says Philippe Hugon from the French think tank Iris.
The key is how far and how long it will spread the virus.
If investors could give the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and invest," warns Hugon.
It also affects the strained state budgets of the Member States
The disease also burdened the already strained state budgets of the countries concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's feared that their budgets are being stretched by high spending on the health system and in addition to the worsening economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros) to help.
The effects are already being felt in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
It is not affected by the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta.
But elsewhere, many people remain at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels go back significantly.
