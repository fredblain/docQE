Matthies says: high time for major networking
Given the galloping technological progress that is threatening to turn our cosy home in high-tech switching centers, comforting our columnist Bernd Matthies with an exceedingly familiar electronic accessories.
As I write this, my view of the spiral cable that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah how retro is this?
But it is a thought: if the cables were all listeners in the shortest possible time to fly around in the house, and that would be significantly more retro.
Already applies to the disgust of the disgust of Tron's?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that is the world of today, tomorrow, bought the waste - obsolete.
And yet today, for example, who has a CRT television in the living room, which simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because it leads to a close at the Ifa again this week, our absolute incompetence in electronics.
The layman, who previously ruled the washing machine and CD player, not even understand the purpose of the devices with incredible eitlem experts, are spread before him: "the Home Health Care and Urban Technologies, wearables," promises the Press Office.
Yes, I'm still?
What should we talk to people who voluntarily appear to spread such Quark?
In fact, it is about 20 years ago that we are supposed to connect our house.
It reordered the yoghurt itself, so that tells us the fire on holiday in the Maldives that it burns in the office.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we are from the office of the air conditioning in our early arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will soon be true: we certainly raise our watch, they say, according to "suck!" - And at home, the vacuum cleaning robot.
Astray.
It all amounts to nothing less than a revolution: "blurring the boundaries between white and brown goods," a story of the washing machine, you can connect with headphones, the steam car sends the weather forecast and data glasses indicates how long it takes the pizza in the oven, but what use is nothing because we are in a traffic jam.
From the daily practice, we also know that if there is a need for a front device times really urgent, the battery is guaranteed.
Which is another reason that will survive the spiral cable on the phone the next radio exhibitions.
