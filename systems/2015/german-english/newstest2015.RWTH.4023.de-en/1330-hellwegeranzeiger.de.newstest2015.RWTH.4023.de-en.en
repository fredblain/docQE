The district said the union of German drivers (GDL), Sven Schmitte in DÃ¼sseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There is no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike was the transport of goods.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything possible to keep the impact as low as possible.
The GDL did not say, however, where it wants to strike, so it is difficult to foresee the consequences.
