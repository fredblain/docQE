The government believed that salaries continue to be paid on accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reported for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear in the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure that their data will be included on the biometric registration, was announced in a government message.
