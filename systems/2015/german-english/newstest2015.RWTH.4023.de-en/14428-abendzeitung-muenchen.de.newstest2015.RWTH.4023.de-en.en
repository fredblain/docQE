After the election in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl, NPD's prohibition is called into question
Given the voting losses of the NPD in Saxony, the CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has argued for an end to the ongoing proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the NPD.
Berlin - The German CDU deputy Thomas Strobl should find an end to the ongoing proceedings to ban against the NPD in the constitutional court.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also head of the CDU country in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
That is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and in front of the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed narrowly in the vote on Sunday at the five% threshold.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party had failed in 2003, because of the protections in the NPD's top informants at the time.
