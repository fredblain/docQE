The statement that the plans were first announced in July, are definitely wrong, "says Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are "Vorfestlegungen decisions" or "preferences, however, it is."
The access to the necessary expansion of the narrow street castle was less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine metre wide street was and is not mentioned.
It is the current state at 5.50 meters, which is a metre wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
