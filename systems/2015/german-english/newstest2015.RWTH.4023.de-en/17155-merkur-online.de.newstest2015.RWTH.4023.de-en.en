One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.

After a few months in a camp in Bavaria, it was 1946 - in the freight car.
So judges staggered into the Upper Franconian lower village.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg, Germany.
Manfred Richter had to run ten miles six times a week to the next station, take the train to Bamberg, three kilometres across the entire city and go back to school.
After two months, got Manfred Richter in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a sleeping: along with up to 15 students in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and 1954 candidates after three years of teaching the second exam.

"Mayor Goetz was very friendly," recalled school judges.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative, who had responded to a school on law and justice: "we must never forget the love." Manfred Richter set up what he had heard as a young teacher.
"We need to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84 -year-old.
And he had to learn: "do not always succeed." Whether he means to his students or just his own six children, is not entirely clear.
In any case, the judge was sometimes unconventional.
If they are students, he got a criminal work and were not ordered to sit.
At the expense of the community, judges had to buy two pairs of boxing gloves and left the two sides against each other, even if there should be a violet.
