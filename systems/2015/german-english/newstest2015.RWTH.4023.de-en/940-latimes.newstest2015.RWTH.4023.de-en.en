Putin called on Kiev to the inclusion of "welfare talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, according to Russian media reports that the Ukrainian government is fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow was later realized that did not mean that Putin will be under the control of the separatist area of eastern Ukraine part of Russia, but that its status must be defined in relation to the Russian-speaking region of Ukraine, the power of representation of its rights and interests.
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits the strategy apparently since the beginning of the riots five months ago: aid to the separatists in the areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossiya de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the territories held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the area as "Novo Rossiya" or "Novorossiya," a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaign for the elections on Oct. 26, while government groups and civilian communities in the attacking areas held by separatists hope for imminent peace talks are "trapped" in their illusions, told Itar-Tass.
"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organisation of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threaten their cultural and linguistic rights.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because there is no conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have been far more difficult to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict in Ukraine to remain a broad majority.
The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine, its own authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin a de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his investiture speech on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, which provide the respective areas of greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy appears in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, is accused of arming and incitement to Moscow.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by a further encroachment of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks have entered on the previously peaceful region in eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.
The coup that took over the Russian-backed separatists, according to the fears of Ukrainian security agents, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are under way to Mariupol, a steel industry port of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions that lead to the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers have had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after the two columns of Russian tanks and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the beleaguered separatists, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Repo, on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, announced on Sunday with Cadets.
