Harburg: new tents for refugees
Now refugees are housed in tents on Neulaender Square.
The initial reception of refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the agency has set up three tents of the Red Cross.
Politicians were informed shortly before the district - they are not pleased.
"These quick-fix actions continue to foment public reservations and give the politicians a chance to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says about Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is demanding that the District Harburg currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the reception, the influx of people needing help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough seats in a row.
Therefore, many refugees remain longer than the regular three months.
