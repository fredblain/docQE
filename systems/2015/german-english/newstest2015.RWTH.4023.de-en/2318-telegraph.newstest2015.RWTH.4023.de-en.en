The tradition of school balls in the U.S. will now be transferred to the universities, where Freshmen performances are offered with the private.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service for students of today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also admitted that the service was a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to dump their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new -start options, we look forward to ensure that this year the students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said that there were no new bookings, just because the service had been introduced, but added that "the students book service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that it expects a market for this offer, despite the tuition fees of Â£9,000 per year.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands of the students before 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and never can be.
The National Student Union criticised, but the service.
Megan Dunn, vice-president of the NUS for higher education, said: "this offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who begin this month with the study, are facing a crisis in the cost of living, because the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships with soaring bills for the simplest livelihoods step before they can even think of thousands of pounds for something as simple as the arrival in the hostel.
