Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights.
The congressmen, Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions, die die too middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and deputy chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
That is why I am proud with the civil rights icon John Lewis before the employee empowerment law.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions, like other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti union of the forces.
In addition to the national labour law in order to create a way for the discrimination of workers to organize an union to sue in civil court for justice - and to receive compensation or the - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, suggest Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks faced by the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - once countries around the world have encouraged Americans to recognise labour rights to extend and respect.
There was a time to remember the millions of Americans in this country, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath.
As the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that would replace the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos through democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that "guarantees the rights of workers to union and common negotiation and action."
As the United States after World War II Germany, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organise themselves, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified: "the right to form associations in order to secure employment and to improve economic conditions and guarantees of every individual and every profession or industry.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void; seeks measures are unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other author is a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect its interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans accept the premise that labour rights are human rights.
When this country other countries how to shape the civil and democratic societies, Americans said that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and that the union should take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights were under attack in America, it is indeed very wise to remember that the American ideal of working people must have the right to unite and in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr., fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now we all know that the labour movement is not limited to the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people miraculously work has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels.
Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history.
History remembers, and we should do this.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and delivering on the promise of democracy.
