Tax rises of businessmen in the Washington area with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while accelerating the economic recovery, a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 financial year, $26.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenue.
State and local tax burden of companies last year rose by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes more than the local taxes rose to 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by Ernst & Young service agency with the National Center for taxation, a tax policy group was conducted.
More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent comes from corporate taxes, compared to 36 percent of the revenue from Mary's company.
Virginia made with 28 percent of the lowest tax revenue from companies.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the real estate companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years, with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California, New York and Texas, seems to be the end for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia were paying about $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 percent in the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of the tax rulings of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland is happening: a large part of the property, particularly in the tax area, D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland, for example, is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, in order to be able to offer the same services that offer the other states.
The recent recovery of tax revenues by companies may not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate revenues also seem to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported on income taxes $2.3 billion in state organizations, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend in the same direction, does not increase the local tax burden on companies evenly in all three locations.
The increase rate in the District, with 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase was significantly higher in Maryland, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed tax).
The corporate tax rate is 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year in Virginia that requires lower state and local taxes and a better overall tax climate than in Maryland.
The District was not investigated in the study.
Despite the advantages of Virginia under pressure from its southern neighbours.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime, the small businesses in the area of Washington seems to be better, and they therefore pay more state and local taxes, the most recent study.
Corporate taxes paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure on the basis of most small businesses - are organised in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significant faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the region will lag behind Washington, if the spending of the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region.
