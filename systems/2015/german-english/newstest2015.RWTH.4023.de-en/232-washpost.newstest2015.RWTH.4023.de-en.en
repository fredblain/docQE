Feminists criticise race and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was at the beginning of this month, killed by a police officer in Ferguson.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot," while they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race, when it comes to reproductive rights and to address income inequality.
While tensions rose in the Midwest, and received attention throughout the country, saw Perez that turned the responses of white women, 100% of the race.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But Perez meant an important change.
"I do not think that many people in feminism, and talk about the white privileges on the high-class kind," she said.
The people felt pushed to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized so that they have to say.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems faced by black women every day, but not be seen as "women's issues" in the cultural area.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in public spaces?" She asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For black women, they have not had the luxury of separating the issues of clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
While the issues of race and gender combine white women in the feminist mainstream circles, says Angela Hattery, professor of women and at the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite.
"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890, and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery came the division between white and black women at the point where white fighters for women such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century, and that could be the fight for the right to vote only for one group: women or blacks.
"They took the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
If such things are remembered, one with power, why don't trust women of color white women.
We have not done our job well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after 1920 women were given the right to vote, it took a decade to get organized, white women against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was founded almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the times in which white feminists played "catch" with the problems of black women for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child's education as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" Asked Mitchell.
The second generation of feminists, who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, try to understand what that means.
The familiar white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian, which calls for more protests on the issue of racism by white Americans.
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are significantly different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, which raises the race as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the racial issue in America.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "who Stole Feminism?" Said to She The People, that young men in the United States, in particular young men of color, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson, in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, clapped in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were infuriating reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes the women for immigration reform, said that the issue as a key issue for women it must publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of working visas, male immigrants, are the women who accompany them in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an echo in the women's organisations," she said.
