On the bouncy castle at the castle garden festival was on Saturday.
The concept of the organizer.
Despite the strong downpours on Saturday evening an estimated 1200 fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
The admission had to be stopped temporarily.
"It was annoying," said Ron Shem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Two Spanish words have formed the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden will radiate brightness on the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was demonstrated early Saturday, when the first visitors to the open air.
The organizers had promised a feast for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply at the castle garden, it had also made Salzwedeler, guests from the near future.
They pursued the first live performances, wippten with the foot of the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short, were called for relaxation and enjoyment.
And across the generations.
While the luemmelten on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar, labten others at a quarter of wine in the wine, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in the face of the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word to the crowd, and to conjure up imaginative creations into the little faces.
Adults used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, the crew of the good foot from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m. rubberpussy he settled on visitors, especially families sought the vastness and nests.
But this did not diminish the attractiveness of the festival.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Shem, a "success on the line."
That is why I am a repeat of the big party in the coming year, nothing.
Although it has to be worked on the content and size of the events, Sem made on Sunday in a first assessment to the popular vote.
He described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result: some who had already paid, were no longer on the site.
The response was very good.
In a first tentative estimate, said the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors, the contrast in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks "n" Rox broke their appearance so unnerved.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably sensible sound.
The planned shisha lounges could be built, because the tents could not be brought because of a puncture after Salzwedel.
"But they will be next year," says the organiser.
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was succeeded by the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some errors that will be the first time, but must be eliminated at the second edition.
On the social network Facebook, the organizers critique.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros, we expected more," says Melanie Meier on the events page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same point.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I think it is very good that some people are not only stupid, but also really try to do something on their feet.
Hats off!, "writes Stephanie Jen√ü for Amula.
Now the organizers a year to these criticisms.
