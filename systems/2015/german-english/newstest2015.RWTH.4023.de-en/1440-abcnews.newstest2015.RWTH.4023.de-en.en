Israeli children are returning to the war in Gaza in their schools back
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip on Monday returned to the schools, after they had spent the summer in air protection areas, while rockets and mortar shells on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza fell and the schools remained closed, while the area recovered from the fighting.
The school brought the rocket launch no shot holes in communities in the south of Israel, a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battles are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" - Kindergarten, which has been hit by a missile, before the arrival of the student shrapnel shards from the walls and sliding walls.
"We are a bit scared, but excited," said Bart Ronit, someone who lives in Kibbutz Saad and local English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a bit weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we have not gone out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
The war until a cease-fire last week, thousands of residents of border communities remained cut off as Saad in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and the rocket and mortar fire to escape.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the border with Gaza, in which a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is heavily scarred by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that you get their knowledge and provide security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to a permanent ceasefire.
The ceasefire provided an immediate end to the fighting, but major problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three quarters of them civilians, and the Palestinians and the U.N. estimates that at least 494 children.
Israel denies those claims and estimates that at least half of those killed by militants, but presented no concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools, which have been converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues, the educational authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school is open again soon, so that we can continue to learn, just as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
