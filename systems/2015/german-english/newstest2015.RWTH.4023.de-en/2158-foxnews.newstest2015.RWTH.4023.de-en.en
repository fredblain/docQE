4 tips for better pictures and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof Point and Shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or Action Cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.
I took these photos with a family celebration with several cameras, which are all available at a price of less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are closed.
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to get in.
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording, which optimizes the exposure time for the underwater twilight conditions.
And before you jump into it, check until the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are allowed only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Browse our buyers and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because not many fold.
Point and shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose images, not normally action cams.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the right picture setting is a matter of chance.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a row mode, which made a series of recordings with slightly altered exposure settings, you can use it.
Stay near the surface.
The light is dramatically worse, ever further away from the surface.
If so, you can stay close to the surface, if you are shooting in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water.
It is particularly important if you are working with an Action Cam: these devices often have a wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill the whole picture.
