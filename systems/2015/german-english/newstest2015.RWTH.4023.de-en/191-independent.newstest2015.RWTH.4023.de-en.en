Exclusive extract from Howard Jacob's hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J."
You zerflossen, so the best way to describe it, it could be resolved slowly, like a cardboard box, which has been in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, scratching, and perhaps a little brush.
And then he shook their hands.
The brush, he knew.
He was stachelig, such as hedgehogs, yes.
The last victim was just starting this Stacheligkeit affair, which has been promising to alleviate the boredom of his life than he would have otherwise, and perhaps even a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn solo Mons was a delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart trembling from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
It came with an older accompaniment to the south, considered the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were in the water baths were still spiders, slugs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage.
It was like the house from a children's story, both menacing and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Ailinn Kevern had sat with hands on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had joined in the spirit of service console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of the brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, happy his father had closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
On the basis of their own aggressive songs of this kind were not played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was forbidden - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolesziert obsoleszieren as the word.
In the general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how the people in the books From the dishwasher - for a millionaire - memoirs, novels, cookbooks and love for the music they chose the ballads.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse comic serenade Ailinns big feet.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he said, and automatically presented two fingers to his lips.
His father had done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It began as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told.
If you have a word with a J start without two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
Even then, it was not a very fun game, and even now it was not very funny.
He knew that this was all that was expected of him.
It had to explain what jazz was.
What Ailinn had never heard.
Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.
The improvisation was no longer fashionable.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
The people wanted to be quite sure where it would end up at the beginning of a melody.
Likewise, the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressible mind.
Although he was 10 years old, without being heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he had to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
They probably could not remember her age at a time when the pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that each element of this company agreed to the principle of groups like the talent - and grateful to fate.
African-American people of Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were charged with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning telephone service.
What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewage system; what was left shattered by the Greeks.
Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents had left the country soon as WHAT HAPPENED IF THERE IS WAR, WAR happened - for fear of being accused of Feuerschuerens, fearing that the flames would consume the next - had opened Labneh and shisha pipes - restaurants, were given and were depressed by inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had heard Ailinn only ballads, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words which had her Kevern, could be just as ever.
Music was an expression of love.
"We are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still not understood.
Why your father should have something to love?
He wanted to say that there was a thump, but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in their presence.
They already thought that he was a little strange.
"It appeared to him instead," he said.
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns view.
There was nothing else in the world to see their ungekaemmtes raven black hair.
There was nothing that he otherwise would want to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But this doesn't explain why you vorsingst me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
My feet are too big?
He saw again.
Your feet are not directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
You hate?
Of course, I do not hate you.
This is just the silly song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That was not correct.
It was meant to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm, needed to restrain the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be the Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn solo Mons was red and arose out of her chair, threw the console and buried the wine that they had drunk.
Elderberry flower wine, so it was no excuse for drunkenness.
They seemed to tremble in their excitement, such as palm fronds in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am perverse to you," she said.
Except that I am not at all.
It did him tired, both because of the unnecessary cost of his words as well as the fear that was demonstrated in their eyes when they rebelled against him.
She thought that he would beat them?
She had not told him of the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.
The same men who have been confused with a thicker skin and verdrie√ülicher, WHAT HAPPENED TO WAR than were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, went from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman who refused or derided.
Thick head?
It would have shown her a thick fist when they don't care!
They only canoodle - Deathstar was the word most often used for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - and then they laughed.
The Keverns view was an unnecessary refinement, as was the Deathstar itself an act of violence.
Ailinn solo Mons gave him to go through her body a sign.
He arose from the deckchair as an old man.
She also felt bleiern, but she was surprised by the ferocity of his grief.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew, however.
She saw him on how he removed as from a room on the upper floor of their companion - a man who complained to him by what he had created himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man, she turned back, ashamed to be defeated without fighting spirit - why was this a sight seemed to know them well, if they could not remember a single time, but they had seen something before the day before?
When she was alone again, looked Ailinn solo Mons on her feet.
A number of years before the events worked just told Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher commissioned by Ofnow, the non-legislative body for the public mood, in a brief presentation on the continued violence on low and middle level in the areas of the country where the reduction, if not abolished, will most likely have been expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of violence.
"A lot done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that had a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness historically seen despite the towering spires between the hedges was rarely felt.
But some properties are ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the less the passion that he continues to inspire.
The people weep when listening to sentimental ballads, enthralled claims to overcome difficulties and stories about the virtues of marriage and family life, but does not believe only the former rudeness of rural communities, as well as our urban fabric firmly in the hands, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious argument is looking at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor, when he had read the entire report.
I suggest that you read less novels.
ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you atheist?
"I think I have to say," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme was once again on their right to privacy and refusal to testify.
Feminist?
Again silence.
"I am not asking this," said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.
This is a prejudice free workplace.
We serve a prejudice free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are absolutely unacceptable and commendable in itself, can occasionally results, as you have presented to distort them.
You obviously have prejudices against the church, and these things that you describe as "cowardly" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well, of course, as an expression of strength and vitality.
If you ride around on WHAT IS IF THERE IS, as if it would have happened if it had happened yesterday, means the country's essential vitality.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head repeated a LED sticker in Flamingo pink Ofnow the advice that gave the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile, you appreciate their neighbors, their partners, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, you talk, you listen, you agree to apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the song is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand completely what you want," said Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end, "and I say that we are not yet healed as effective as we delude ourselves.
My concern is that we find ourselves without warning, perhaps, as we repeat the mistakes in the first place, IF THERE IS THIS WHAT IS.
This time, however, it is not others where we miss our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz, a pyramid with hands.
In order to indicate a patient.
"They go too far," he said, "if you act as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far when you say that their "anger" and their "mistrust" of "others" had left out.
It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, not by "us" and "other."
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves," dared to Esme, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I accuse anybody.
Whether it was done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
Nothing more needs to be said - we are all agreed.
And just as no blame must be assigned, it must be repaid, not to blame, if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to eradicate it.
But what if we do not learn from the past -
The past is that we forget them.
If I may say something about that -
Luther Rabinowitz did coincide his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said, and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, was run over by a motorcyclist, who, as passers-by described, in a kind of "brutal rage" was driven onto the footpath.
There are coincidences.
