"Guardians of the Galaxy" why was not a blockbuster
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the United States, while "sin City: a Dame to Kill For" only $12 million in its budget of $70 million.
The film "sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played the busiest only $14.6 million, while children's films such as "easy to tame dragons made 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the children's films could be the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year for children's films" and "2" made it easy to tame dragons as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
In films for a slightly older audience, however, it appears as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly average Cinema Score and Meta Critic - evaluation for each summer movie, between the American Memorial Day and the 20th of July 2013 and at least 2000 canvases in the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year's film hits equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing habits and the growing popularity of Web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming animated film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept that and not try to chase after the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix streaming content with the recent sales of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticised the film studios that they concentrated too much on the comic and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could contain a true core.
Because of the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including the Gers: Age of Jurassic World Ultron, Minions and other representatives of the film industry, however, are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as "cyclical" and compared to the Hollywood Reporter said: "the next summer will be the biggest summer box-office at all, and no one will be more concerned about the business."
