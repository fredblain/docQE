This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the land for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in each school.

We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian People's Front has to fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk who visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that here at last at peace, and that the children receive an education that will be useful to them in later life.
