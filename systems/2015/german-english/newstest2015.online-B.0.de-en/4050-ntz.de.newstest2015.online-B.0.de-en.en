Sergeant ret. Berni Diether since the closure of the former military training area works as a pyrotechnician
For almost ten years, is no longer shooting at the former military training area in Münsingen.
Still appeared every month on lethal ammunition in the heart of the biosphere reserve Swabian Alb.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they must be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang reverberates with blasting through the heart of the biosphere reserve.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was fired on the military training area Münsingen, which was closed in late 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area is the heart of the biosphere reserve Swabian Alb, which is open at 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
