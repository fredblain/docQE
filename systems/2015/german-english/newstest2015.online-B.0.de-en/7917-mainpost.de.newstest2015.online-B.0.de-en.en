A powerful tribe we showed at our mystery object of the summer series "My Piece of the Rhöner luck" last Friday.
Several of these giant trees there are in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It goes past paddocks, basalt rock piles and basalt stone seas.
