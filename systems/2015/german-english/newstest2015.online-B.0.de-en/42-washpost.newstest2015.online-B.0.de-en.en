Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with the economic recovery
An economic recovery means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for businesses in the country rose last year slightly, while accelerating the economic recovery, a new study published in the past week, and the company in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid $ 27.6 billion to state and local agencies in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the revenues of 2012 totaling $ 26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 percent to 671 billion $ to, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining assessments in 2009 and 2010 ,
State taxes rose more sharply than the local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue from Maryland's undertakings.
Virginia scored 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from businesses.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in property values ​​of companies, researchers, which resulted in an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent say.
While a large part of these gains came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be true also for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid about $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to 9.6 billion dollars 2012 - an increase during the year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in housing values ​​is in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues because the property taxes amount here on just over one fifth of the tax assessments of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"The following occurs in Maryland: a large part of real estate, particularly in the tax area to DC, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely for example much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services may be offered by other States.
The recent rebound in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Corporate income seem to recover well, the data.
Companies in the region reported on income tax in the state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies not rise evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was markedly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas which significantly lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia less state and local business taxes are required and a better overall control climate prevails as in Maryland.
In the study, the District has not been studied.
Despite the advantages Virginia is pressurized by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this bill could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent.
In the meantime, it seems the small businesses in the Washington area better to go, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, as the most recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure, according to which the majority of small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars, a significant faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes in total.
The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably continue in the corporate tax rates across the country this year, with an increase in general More Wehr tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to same period last year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag if the spending cuts the federal government affects the labor market in the region.
