Tighten the castle clubs soon join forces?
Recently there have been quarrels between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the board members think about possible cooperation after.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser castle led by the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser castle Friends at the project in French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle club friends Wolfratshausen.
Pronounced seemed different so far the positions should be how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction.
Now the two camps to move toward each other: It will be soon held discussions on a common approach.
This is confirmed by the club directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) on demand of our newspaper.
"I called and suggested that we could sit down together once Mr. Piffl" says Sjöberg.
In his view, all the members of both teams could continue pulling back together.
So were recorded faster visible results.
While the castle Friends at the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until recently had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye, is the castle club Sjöberg the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the site at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, Vice Chairman of the castle and friends has been very pleased by its own account on the call.
Since Dimbaths death he stands in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in mid-September in a general meeting.
Currently the association has, according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we leave the association's activities rest out of respect first." This "thinking phase" was necessary in order "to consider how it could go on."
According Piffl the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Castle Club.
Until then, the castle and friends might also make an impression of the mood within their grouping.
A candidate for the presidency, there is not currently says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find". He himself does not want to run, because they are domiciled in Bad Toelz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted in the project "but very happy to cooperate."
The different points of view when it comes to reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes Piffls in the near future.
It commends Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
A high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from around the world they are a tourist attraction.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at first.
But over time I am more and more come to the conclusion that it makes sense to move the project forward. "It could a" unique selling point "for Flößerstadt be created.
There nothing else.
In addition, the project by EU grants, admission tickets and potential sponsors would be financed, believes Piffl.
"The idea of ​​reconstruction so I will personally do not simply throw overboard". He hoped that the castle club in this point may move slightly.
Their goal, the history documented first, "is important and good."
Then you could see.
