Merkel speaks Power Word: toll will be "very clear"
Now the Chancellor is committed once more to clear.
A charter for all the complicated details but it is not.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have the CSU visibly angry.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a word of power for the introduction of a car toll to ongoing resistance from her CDU.
"To put it bluntly: It is in the coalition agreement, and they will come", the party leader said on Monday after meeting the leading CDU bodies in Berlin.
In a detailed model Merkel put but for now not fixed.
In black-red government program were "certain parameters" called.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) had "made a proposal, and to the will now continue to work".
However, the NRW-CDU stands by its no to a toll equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) bring constructively in the discussions for a bill.
About the topic, he had spoken with Dobrindt also other ways to enable more private capital for investments in infrastructure, such as also in broadband expansion.
"There is nothing special to it." Schäuble had left without comment on Sunday a "mirror" report, his house review its own approach to reward investors with highway toll revenues - after the election 2017th
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned then about to develop toll concepts against the lead minister in the Cabinet.
CDU Vice Armin Laschet reiterated its objections.
"The coalition agreement was never expecting to bemauten all county and federal highways," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU regional chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer have now announced that they will speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU regional associations of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
Background are fears that a toll impaired local border traffic with neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU.
The left sees the plans in view of the dispute in the Union as a failure.
"The botch-toll is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll fails the Minister". Dobrindt plans to introduce a toll sticker on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
Domestic car owners are allowed, according to the coalition agreement, but not an additional burden.
Therefore, they should get on the road tax full compensation for the tolls.
The model allowed foreign drivers but under EU regulations do not discriminate on grounds of nationality.
