Putin demanded from Kiev, the recording of "statehood talks" with the Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Russian media reports said on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government to end the fighting against separatists in the east of the country and receives directly with negotiations to "rule" the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskov was later clear that Putin had not meant that under the control of the separatist region of eastern Ukraine, a part of Russia will, but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined to the Russian-speaking region the power to to provide representation of its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian rebel fits however since the start of the riots five months ago apparently pursued by him strategy: helping the separatists in taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed Region Novorossija to allow de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state television channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture held by separatist territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea had annexed on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have called the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "New Russia" lately, a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope in the course of campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct 26, and during the reign of groups to attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists for early peace talks "caught in its illusions" are reported Itar -Tass.
"We need to immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the state status of East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the law in the context of greater autonomy must be seen to be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government may grant the eastern parts of the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine.
The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and so the Kremlin effectively give control of an area that the Russian territory with the Crimea connects.
The annexed five months ago peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture key components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, with which the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of the languages ​​is given.
But his idea of ​​autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, their armament and incitement Moscow accused.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders at eye level, followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tanks invaded over the previously peaceful areas along the Sea of ​​Azov in the eastern Ukraine.
The Russian-backed separatists took by surprise, which is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, according to Ukrainian security official fears that control of Novoazovsk.
Because of this massive civil and military preparations are under way to fasten a steel industry Mariupol port with 500,000 inhabitants, lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years.
"We are nearing a point at which there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided any concrete actions that leadership demanded the design of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat in Ilowajsk from their positions after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donezkregion to support the beleaguered separatist, Colonel Andrei Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports said on Saturday in Kiev ,
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.
