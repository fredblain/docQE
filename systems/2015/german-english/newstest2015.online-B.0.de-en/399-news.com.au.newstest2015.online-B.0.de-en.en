Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought as a result of misdiagnosis for many years that they would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that they have only to live a few years after they had been diagnosed with any other disease.
You actually suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnosis is a common problem in people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer probably at CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsteady gait and curved toes.
Diseased also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, meaning that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed it to Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) suffer -. A disease with very poor survival
Rodgers thought she was in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I could not do the same as the others.
I fell down to earth and everything took longer with me.
I could never go with the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was teased often go to school because of my way to walk.
Rodgers said that after several operations to relieve their Achilles tendons and stretch their feet their medical report einsah aged 13 years, as her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-society," she said.
When I got to say, I was shocked and fell terribly panicked.
I thought that I would be 18 in a wheelchair and die with 25, and would slowly lose in between all my skills.
I did that all on my own with me and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her skills had not been greatly reduced as they had imagined and questioned their doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "my dear, I do not think you have that, otherwise you're already in a wheelchair."
I think you've got something far less life-threatening.
After a few genetic tests CMT was found with her.
"When he told me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness of this disease.
