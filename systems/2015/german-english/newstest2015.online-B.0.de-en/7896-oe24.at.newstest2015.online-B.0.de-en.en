Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to winning ways Rapid has shown with the second win of the season the right response to the disappointment to Helsinki and goes with a sense of achievement in the international break.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who has paved the way to victory with his splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck after 14 minutes.

Had met as Schrammel 13 Novmember 2010. so far the last time in a Bundesliga game that was still for Ried.
The first Championship goal in Rapid's suits will therefore remain in his special remembrance.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid-junior" Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic Blessur Mario Pavelic moved Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also made a very good job there.
He has enough experience that he can exercise this position reversed.
He deserved the goal he has this year already made some assists "praised Barisic.
Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the cross for 2: 0 by Hofmann after the hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that might well have write the guests.
"Thank God we have had some luck today," remarked also Schrammel, who thus alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but playfulness has always been good compared to last year" ,
Barisic was even that one "in many games before better than today" was - against "the strongest team that has played this season in this stadium."
The first three Punkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks, "Today my team has shown that it has character."
For him, no less gratifying: "The fact that we finally played back to zero".
A lot of work during international break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger multiple failures are to be deplored, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their Startelfdebüts, the victory makes even more valuable.
"One must not forget," Barisic, with Behrendt and Pavelic players lost in the past three days, "which were very stable lately" admonished.
The international break should thus be used to "to lick wounds and a bit zuzulegen in the physical realm," said Barisic who has five Under-21 players in its ranks.
One, the break probably comes particularly located, Captain Hofmann.
He tears up for the team, going through pain over it.
In this difficult period, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "stated Barisic.

Hofmann: "Can not believe that now everything is good" "We've certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us as well.
Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.
He warned course to concentrated Next work: "One must not always see the black and white.
We have in recent weeks played not as bad as has been shown.
But we must not also believe that now everything is good.
The importance of his role for the team, he could not deny.
It's a very young team, I can help at the moment very much.
The talk in certain phases but at me to ", Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to reproach.
He regretted the quick goal "from the category magic door", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute which was disallowed by referee Kollegger wrongly.
The only criticism that I can make the team is that we in some stages were not concrete enough towards the goal.
Since we have had too little accounts.
Centre Back Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It has the same bad start, then we have found but pure, and even scored a goal.
On the whole would have been possible more.
