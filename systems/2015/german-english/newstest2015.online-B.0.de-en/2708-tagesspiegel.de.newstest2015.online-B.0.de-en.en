Ebola: The epidemic burdened West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow to the economy.
Markets have been orphaned - and international companies go the distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic offset the economy of West Africa a severe blow.
The harvest rotted in the fields, the mines are left orphaned and the markets - the virus has severely the region added.
Some international companies are already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not just a medical crisis, but also an economic," says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia clothing.
Hits the market, only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus alone here fell fever more than 600 victims.
Recently declared the health authorities, the disease had advanced in every corner of the country.
Even in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, the virus has spread.
In total, more than 1,500 people died, thousands more infected per se.
Foreign companies deduct employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries put companies out of their operation.
Foreign companies like the steel group Arcelor Mittal deduct their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers respond: Few merchants will leave their homes to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia who are under quarantine, rotting among other things that are important for the export cocoa and coffee beans in the fields.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
"People are getting less traveling," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris Expert for the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, which normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
Therefore, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic to be felt directly and urgently, food is scarce.
In the markets of dwindling supply of staple foods such as rice.

The greatest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus will not spread.
For investors the impression could arise, "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest," warns Hugon.
The disease burden and the strained budgets of States
The disease also burdened the already strained budgets of the countries concerned.
The rating agency Moody's is concerned that their budgets are strongly stressed by the high costs for the health system and also from the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank pledged already, help out the health systems of the affected countries at 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
Noticeably, the effects are already in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases were diagnosed.
While the oil-rich region in southern Niger Delta is not affected so far.
But elsewhere already many people stay at home for fear of contagion.
Even reservations in hotels back significantly.
