In a statement to the New Press it contradicts statements the CEO Peer Medau and attests this to pose "like a general."
The style of the university was not this, it reads the statement.
So the family Medau had already been "in mid-June verbally informed about the suggestion of the university.
The statement said that the plans were announced in July, are definitely wrong, "said Pötzl.
At the same time he points out that it is not in the plans to "establish preconditions or even decisions", it however "preferences" would.
Also, the necessary for the access expansion of the narrow road up to the castle was less dramatic than feared by Medaus.
Was of a nine-meter-wide road and there is no mention.
It goes to the current state of 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before, "explains Pötzl.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and the school's parking areas are then used in the future only by students of the University, refuses to accept Pötzl.
Zugeparkt is not at all, because this can be solved intelligently now as with other public parking.
Think of the residents
The crèche Mountain Imp, which is located on the premises and the entrance to the parking deck along would result prior to their doorstep should, according to the university presidents "are not impaired".
Rather, he points out, "that this is not just about the nursery, but also to the residents at the confluence of the Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 pupils of the neighboring secondary school.
It is about much more than the particular interests gentlemen Medau "said Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parents' council of the nursery, with the expansion of the road would be a "rare nature spots Coburg lost" was entitled "The reader can decide for himself."
In early October 2020 will Pötzl inform together with the State Building Authority Bamberg city councils on the structural development of the university "and to address the importance of the new development in this regard".
Peer Medau had last week the parents of the nursery on the plans of the university informed.
Accordingly, the access road for the new parking deck will not cause as far across the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-road, but via the Medau Mountain.
This would have to be expanded two-lane narrow road at about one kilometer long.
According to extrapolations of Medaus the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would increase tenfold with it.
From about 2000 vehicles a day is mentioned.
On the part of the city so far declined to comment on the project is located.
