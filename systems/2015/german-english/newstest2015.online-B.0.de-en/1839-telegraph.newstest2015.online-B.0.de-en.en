With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director, she needs.
She arrives with a proud fame train of the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And it has its own combat experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombardier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was seven years Chief Executive of the Financial Times and stepped back as the top item of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male counterparts.
Your severance was allegedly almost £ 1 million.
Her political ranking is solid.
It was recommended by David Cameron, Lord Browne, the former head of BP, as this was looking for more private-sector expertise in Whitehall: it became a consultant of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory councilor.
As early as May, I described the task of the Chairman of a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The Trust works in two directions: inwards towards the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and unrest, when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost untenable duopoly, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming chairman would risk to begin to embark on anything and dismantle an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while this itself might bring about his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if not enough, are also still many interested in the BBC reduced to see - obsolete power, money and status.
While the competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special risks.
For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British public will buy into the certainly largest media companies in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them only 40 pence per day costs.
And apparently increases the BBC on the popularity scale up again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: nowadays I get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope they found him.
