Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion
AMAZON confirmed just what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion (970 million USD).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had a takeover of Twitch expected but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion thing, and cooperation also appeared naturally.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, a "YouTube for live games," said an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "Let's Play", a video genre, the (mostly older) give in the alls play an air of secret science theater, are on YouTube already very popular.
The fact is that YouTube is often referred to when describing Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, received a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not successfully, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know right now about this statement of Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values ​​and long-term visions and they want to help us quickly get there. "
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who declare that they prefer to play sports than watch her, it's hard to understand the attraction, which assumes watch others play themselves instead of taking the control console in the hand.
It's one thing to a friend by 3 clock in the morning to look over his shoulder as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner in how he is shot 20 times in succession in Call of Duty in the head.
All these games you could now watching.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so the Watching without their own control over the viewing perspective may be a really good recipe for a headache.
I admit that the quick runs in the complete the Roger Bannister of our electronic age all the games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or a virtuoso humor is going to be Twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what the skeptics as I know it already?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly will Amazon make it money?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, like YouTube Twitch just could swallow.
But Twitch has something that every business would like to have: thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the media shows no signs of shrinking, not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.
