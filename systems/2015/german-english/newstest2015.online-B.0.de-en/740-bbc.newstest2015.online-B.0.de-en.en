NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend there were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday about 150 people came together in Cardiff in front of the local town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has followed us for the developments over the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who have traveled from Bridgend to Belgium.
