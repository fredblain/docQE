Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. earlier this month.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, do not shoot," while she waited outside the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
After her experience set white feminist commentators sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
While tensions in the Midwest but rose and across the country were given attention, saw Perez that the responses of white women turned to 100% to the breed.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "thought to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez meant an important change.
"I do not think there are many people in the feminism that will be on the White and speaking privileges on such high-class kind," she said.
People felt urged to express something to the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized that you need to express that.
For English Professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University Ferguson brought problems to light, which black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered to be "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how Colored stand in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not on safety in public places?" she asked.
Have studied in US history for black women as Mitchell, the race, gender and sexuality, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of the issues cleanly separate; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now join the race and gender issues in the mainstream feminist circles, says Angela Hattery, Professor of Women's and Gender Studies at George Mason University that her predecessors were doing the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery the split between white and black women came to the point where the white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote a on each group could be successful: women or black.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later," said Hattery.
If one remembers such things, one realizes with power, why black women white women do not dare.
We have our job not done well.
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman Hanes Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help on the part of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time, where white feminists "catch" toyed with the problems faced by black women sat down for generations apart.
"Would not it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms the right to education of a child would take as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation who have built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting death of Michael Brown on Facebook and published an incisive article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which it calls for more protests of white Americans against racism.
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason to understand a body inherent danger - and views on race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism, are addressed in the race as well as gender issues, some are still baffled by their comments on the race issue in America.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" She told The People that young men in the United States, especially young black men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem comments on Ferguson standing in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently released a small program, My Brother's Keeper, hung up to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the US border police have seized nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women's issue, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants who are the women who accompany them, in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories will find an echo in the women's organizations," she said.
