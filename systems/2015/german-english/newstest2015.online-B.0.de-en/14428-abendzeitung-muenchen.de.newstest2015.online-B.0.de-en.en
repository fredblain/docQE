After election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl provides NPD ban procedures may include
Given the loss of votes by the NPD in Saxony, CDU Deputy Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the current NPD ban proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Deputy Thomas Strobl should find the current prohibition proceedings against the NPD in the Federal Constitutional Court to an end.
"The NPD is worse off than the last time", Strobl, who is also a CDU state leader in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung" said.
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to come to the conclusion that the NPD political fights and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed during the vote on Sunday narrowly missing the five-percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party in 2003 failed because of the Protection of the Constitution at that time also in the NPD-top had informants.
In December 2013, the Federal Council reached after long preparation a further application in Karlsruhe.
Federal Government and the Bundestag not followed.
