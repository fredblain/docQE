"Pig-house" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed from real estate agents, as has been clear that there was a big pig that had made themselves comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a master bedroom, located on a private road in Ipswich and is offered for £ 120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig that his head had laid on a sofa.
Estate Agents Connell said the pig in the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo was not published by mistake and has since been removed," said a spokeswoman for the company.
In the exposé of the house Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has the image of the website removed, it still appears on promotional materials.
The home sales made in social media for interest, as some questioned whether the bank is included in the purchase price.
