180 kilometers in three days
HR4-BIKE RIDE 700 cyclists insert in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scots stopovers
If cyclists make their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots snap, that's nothing special about it.
On Friday, however, made only the quantity of catch impression: The 700 participants of the bike ride hr4 including accompanying entourage enjoyed a break in the lower spa gardens in Bad Salzhausen and later a party under the open sky in Schottener Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Biking and celebrate newfound paths between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and there witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, 60 kilometers above Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Scots in attack.
In Bad Salzhausen athletes from Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started as well in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the director of the Own Plant Operation Bad Salzhausen, Petra swing Döring were welcomed.
For refreshment of body and mind had been prepared all sorts of good things: The countrywomen from Ranstadt and low-Mockstadt had 85 plates Apple, Zwetschen-, sprinkles and cheesecake baked that mundeten the capable cyclists wonderful.
"Such cakes can only rural women bake" praised one participant from Aulendiebach while he ordered another piece.
At the concession stand of Turnvereins Geiss-Nidda cold refreshments could be purchased.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with familiar melodies from operettas and musicals and earned enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful surroundings of the park looked relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "he deserves, after all, he has already secured chipped bicycle chains again today."
Meanwhile had the mayor and the Betriebsleiterin still working: they were interviewed by the fountain in front of the Kurhaus of drinking reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Also Promotion Chef Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike ride in 2004 as tour leader here, could catch only briefly, he had plenty to do with the equipment on site.
His pickup truck in which he communicated via three telephones and a radio with its employees and the 15-member motorcycle squad of police Hesse, wrote Facebook messages and reports made, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants comes from the Rhein-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or Fulda, Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia cyclists arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In Category I, the participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective centers.
From the resort of the cyclists had a good impression when they left again after one and a half hours: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" waved her goodbye.
Upon arrival in the Scottish group could take a short breather.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Old Castle Park.
Under the direction of Schottener Society for Tourism and City Marketing (GTS), the park had received a great party atmosphere and of course they had treats about Tarte with well chilled Federweißer prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as board member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operating in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity for sweeping move in the open air was used frequently despite the sporting activities on the bike.
Among the guests mingled increasingly citizens who were impressed by the good mood as well as the large group of cyclists.
On the second day were for cyclists stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern - on the agenda.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers pedaling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
