4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which can be had for about $ 300.
I took these photos on a family celebration with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $ 350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed.
Make. Your camera also on the photos or videos, which you want to record
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and shooting modes with which the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions is optimized.
And before you jump into it, check the depth to which your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search through our Buying and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD, allowing you to compose images, Action Cams normally.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to consider this under water, and the correct image adjustment is a matter of luck.
So you make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode, with a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings to be made, then use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light is dramatically worse the farther you move away from the surface.
If possible, so stay close to the surface, if you shoot in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to bring more color to your photos; The deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Walk up close to the objects.
This is also good advice to country, but he is under water all the more important because of poor lighting conditions.
It is especially important when you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.
