Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, die, the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore I proudly together with the civil rights icon John Lewis staff the Enabling Act before.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in cases of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and so will stop anti-union set forces.
Supplementing the national labor law law to create an opportunity for discrimination exposed workers to organize a union representative to a civil court to sue for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way is to understand what suggest Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill that would link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, which the unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries around the world encouraged to recognize workers' rights to expand and to be observed.
There was a time, to the millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and the right to organize in the same breath.
When the United States occupied after World War II Japan, encouraged General Douglas MacArthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action."
When the United States occupied after World War II Germany, urged General Dwight Eisenhower David and his staff the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified: "The right to form associations to the working and economic conditions secure and will improve each individual and each profession or trade guaranteed.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim it is to reduce null and void; it targeted measures are unlawful.
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights held, by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 added Roosevelt and the other author of a guarantee a that " everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them. "
For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country other countries to discuss how they could form civil and democratic societies, declared Americans, that the right to form a union - and that this union then could take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - to be protected must.
Having these rights in America came under fire, it is actually very wise, to the American ideal to perform again in mind, according to which working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr., fifty years ago said:
History is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement, the strength of the nation is not restricted, but enlarged.
By raising living standards of millions of people working has created miraculously a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves.
The history remembers, and we should do well.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the enhancement of the protection of citizens' rights to protect against discrimination in the establishment of employee representation - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis to renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy cashed.
