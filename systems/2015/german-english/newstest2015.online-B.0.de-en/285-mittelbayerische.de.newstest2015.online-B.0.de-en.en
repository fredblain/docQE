The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when was founded on March 21, the Association for the "social conversation by exercise in Zimmerstutzen- and small-bore shooting."
The Nazi regime had in 1937 caused the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 have again 19 young men found that on April 30, in Luke the inn "new" gun club "Tannenwald" Berngau have lifted from the baptism.
Charles March and Adolf Ried led the club as Schützenmeister through a difficult initial period in which it primarily concern was to find a club house and install the firing operation.
As early as autumn 1965, the shooting club was launched at the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, established the shooters who were now organized into seven teams, in all classes up to 1 Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic number of 380 rings was achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters have increased, the number of members have developed positively.
After the club house "Leininger" no longer meets the requirements of a modern shooting club, the former managing committee has decided, under the leadership of Johann Rinn to create in the basement of the new "country inn Härteis" a future home.
After a performance of 2700 hours issued on May 8, 1988 Pastor Strasser for new shooters rooms ecclesiastical blessing.
One of the major highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44th Gauschießen, connected with the solemn consecration of the new infantry flag in July 1991st

A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club was the total alignment of the Bavarian firecrackers meeting of 2005.
