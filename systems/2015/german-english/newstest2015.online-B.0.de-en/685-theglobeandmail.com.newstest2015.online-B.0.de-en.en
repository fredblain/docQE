Clever ways to save money at university textbooks
As the cost of college textbooks for many students be more than 1,000 dollars per year, the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.
He invented a lending system for books written by graduate students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sales.
"My math book normally costs 180 $, but I got it for $ 10 for one semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430, he said.
He spent $ 120.
The college management said that students on average spend more than $ 1,200 a year for textbooks and study material, but that it would be several cost-containment options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than the purchase.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Polls in the industry show that about a quarter of the books was hired in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Vice President Neebos Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks to buy, according to the trade association National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.
Here's the basics for the best deals.
Buy Online
Some new books cost online, only a third of the price for which they are to have the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $ 290, however, may be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99.
Buy Used
If one notes the other or normal signs of use do not mind, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used to Chegg.com for $ 93.49 to have.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduating student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions:. Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business"
The book was sold new for $ 48.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors if earlier editions are admissible.
Sometimes the updates for the term papers are not relevant.
In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Except Chegg and Amazon also Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and after completing the course does not want to keep the books.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student could, for example, "Calculus" rent for the duration of a semester for about $ 20.
Check with the hire of the provisions of the business, also on penalties, which, if necessary, apply for writing notes, underline or signs of wear.
Tenants beware: If you do not return the book, the penalties can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
Also e-books rather than traditional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books de facto be hired by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and Chegg Inc. is provided.
In Chegg can "Calculus" for 6 months rent for about $ 61.
Bracey says that students often find in literature courses the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free nowadays, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around in any case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination in books, since you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should consider as Gault, if the book is actually available.
This lesson he learned the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks for delivery and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
