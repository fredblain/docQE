Konstantin alarm brutally honest memoir
It's actually more philosophical testimony as biography, which has brought in "Monk and Warrior" on 287 pages to paper Konstantin Wecker, Songwriter, pacifist, political activist safely, ex-con.
Not chronological, but more thought scraps for scraps of thoughts, born on June 1, 1947 in Munich wrote down his memoirs, each chapter begin with a matching lyrics.
He is brutally honest: from masturbation as a schoolboy to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave human weakness from.
Also, to show how he has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow man himself.
Considerable space take abstract, but all the more important terms a: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, very philosophical, but also a very personal way.
He also introduced his pacifism, his social criticism, his political activism - and also, as it has not only influenced the music (the opera lovers became the soul and rock musicians), but also his prison stay.
The latter has the bon vivant Konstantin Wecker closer brought the ascetic monk who created "by subtraction", as he says, "by omitting anything that is unnecessary".
Between all the high-minded views, there are also short anecdotes to earth: about about fights in a frequented by GIs local or a crazy car ride in which he envisioned a tree head-on.
Even as it is brutally honest.
