Garden centers regret sinking homeowners numbers
The decline together with a reinforced drop in the number of homeowners under 35 years could lead to garden centers lose thousands pounds per year, if today's young consumers reported by a study of the HTA, as in the Financial Times, the "core age group for garden products" reach.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people spend to home for her garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method to asphalting front gardens for parking purposes and the declining size garden are other factors that threaten the industry in which estimated Â£ 5 billion to be implemented annually in sales.
In Greater London, where over a period of 6 years, the proportion of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest spending on garden products per household are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens do not mean that people can not drag plant.
Guy Barter, chief advisor to the RHS garden said: "Container Gardening is very popular among tenants, for example, because you can take your plants when you move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retailing due to rising homeowners numbers and economic prosperity of the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He forecasted for this year also improved market situation because of the better weather to inclement weather conditions in March and April last year.
