The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, such as the fact entangled children suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia were taken hostage.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world, killed.
We returned to Beslan, to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the terrible siege of the school in Beslan, in which 334 people died, including 186 children, warned the heroic survivors last night in front of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
Took as a fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, seemed like the most evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned, surprisingly, in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, though the memory of that terrorist hell they will pursue forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war, which Ukraine now haunts - and in the children as they die - now comes to an end.
The girl, who was photographed in an attempt climb back into the battered Schulsporthalle
She was photographed by the famous Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she tried only in their underwear, climb back into the battered school gymnasium after a mine had exploded.
Totally confused Aida looked after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were believed to be dead, but she survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," said Aida time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back inside to look for my mother.
A soldier brought them to safety.
After a series of operations they thought he was completely cured, however, said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid that I have to have surgery again.
Some shrapnel still in my knee.
Your goal now is to be dentist to help people like her were helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not broken me," she says belligerently.
"That's happened to me, and can not be changed.
Once a year I always go to the gym, to remind me of those who have stayed there.
My friends and I try on other days not to talk about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I do not want to get married until I finish my studies and my career start.
On a family I think later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of each year is somewhat weak.
I am happy that many people around the world still remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people all over the UK and.
If I line the photo of me see how I climb back into the school, I think a lot of people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help ensure that it does not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion, was his mother dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go with 7 years in the school) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
The age of seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
They said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying infant, took her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who joined his son outside in the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, turn on the assumption that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now defunct News of the World) to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion.
"This horror haunting you every day, but I wish I could quit remember," he said yesterday.
But I can say it is paler in my memory.
I remember that I immediately afterwards threw all my toy guns.
But now I can computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I do not think about myself after.
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard, and did not make it out.
We never say that they were killed or are dead.
We say that they have remained in the gymnasium.
I remember very well on my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could pick me everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-topped car.
But now he's afraid to place such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunting you every day, but I wish I could stop myself to remember.
"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, the last week as a volunteer working in a monastery.
I want so much to help.
I will one day go to the police and hope they take me next year at the Training Academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then, as people can understand on the other side of the world, our feelings, and show their support.
She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her yourself, that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting me her and her husband in London, and as the Damir and has helped me.
I still remember how Damir wanted something to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now on, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killing.
These are precisely those children like ours.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the messages that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I know just what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not stop doing it, to feel it.
Nothing has changed, the people want to still kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir was tall and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the recent atrocities.
I know that he does not remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and there ignite candles.
When he was small, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the bed, her face turned away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I had a few hours so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the blast and got to my feet, I looked around, and saw around hell to me, with all lying about body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell.
"I remember that I called to him," Damir, run, run away ", but I was so sure he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on, unlike many others, for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible picture after the siege became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan was
Trost: The Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of George today
His blood-streaked face was lined with fear as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before they rushed off to bring her elder son Vladimir to the university.
"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to remember and talk about it is.
There is no single day on which we do not remind us of this tragedy.
We do not think that it's a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days haunt me all the time.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Insistently: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was a statue (right) immortalized.
I remember that George on this day so much wanted to go to school. He said he wanted to hug his teachers.
I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even the statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino.
George sees the image does not like, and it is hidden in our home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that the people around the world thanks to this image feel our pain.
Georgy says today: "It is important for that to happen it never again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
The people investigating such tragedies again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world will be something terrible.
"I can not understand how that's possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went later in 2004, back to school and had every day anxiety.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go to the gym when September 1st is approaching.
I want to express my my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I do not pity me.
My life goes on.
I have finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Georgy Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it as if it were yesterday," says George, who wanted to go as an intelligence officer for the FSB, but could not do because of health damage caused by the siege.
It's still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after actually a little better, but I can not forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I went to the gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I'll never go back there and do not ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous, and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like thinking about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
Physically I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.
But because of my health, I could not study at the Secret Service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my documents, also sent medical and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there already two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats to cows".
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
In addition, children should not know anything and they should not suffer it, of course.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is approaching.
I'll go to the celebrations commemorating.
I know that George will not go there.
It still needs to be much more violent for him because he was there and I did not.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so thankful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.
It remains in us.
George is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that, if a bit so happens Unfair.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he is unable to attend due to his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but do not exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and the only strengthened my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for those killed.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows, who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want that.
I'll never forget how my heart leaped within me as I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What fight these people?
Why did they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe almost.
We were used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now struggling?
People and children suffer, I am sure that for many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many are killed.
If we could just all grab and throw these Rebels - as far away as possible.
