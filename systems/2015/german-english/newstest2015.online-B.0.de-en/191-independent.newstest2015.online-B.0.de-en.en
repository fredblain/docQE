Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted away, so you could best describe it, they broke up slowly like a box that you have in the rain leave.
Occasionally told him a woman that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant and perhaps a little crabby.
And then shook his hand.
Crabby he knew.
He was prickly as hedgehogs in, yes.
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was just incipient affair that had been promising for relieving lonely boredom of his life as usual, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart of a village in the North Island, which was even more remote and harsher than Port Reuben.
She had come with a previous accompaniment to the south, held the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley a lot.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, were in the bathrooms even spiders, slugs had left their mark on all the windows and thought they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.
It was like the house of a children's story, both menacing as tempting a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.
Kevern had sat holding hands with Ailinn on the broken sunbeds in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absentmindedly snapped into the service console with soothing music and calming messages supplied the land, as the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainers, which his father loved listening with closed shutters in the house ,
Your feet are too big.
Because of their innate aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played on the console.
Not prohibited - Nothing was really banned - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolesziert so obsoleszieren like the word.
The general taste managed what decrees and regulations have never managed and how people choose books at the From the rags-to-riches memoir, cookbooks and romances, so they chose the ballad with the music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing big feet in a rough-comic Serenade Ailinns.
Ailinn did not understand.
"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
That his father had always done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It had started out as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, as he had told.
When you begin a word with a J, without laying two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was already at that time was not a very fun game and it was now not very funny.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what was jazz.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.
The improvising was no longer modern.
There was only room for one "if" in life.
People wanted at the beginning of a tune to be quite sure where they would end up.
Likewise, the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed understanding.
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, knew Kevern about Jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably could not remember a time, in the pop singer were not black.
Again was, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as the spared by fate.
People with African-Caribbean origin were eligible by temperament and body type for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with such electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning telephone service.
What was left of the Polish community, taking care of the sewage system; what was left of the Greeks, smashed plates.
Those whose grandparents had not left the country quickly from the Gulf states and the Levant as WAS DONE WAS WHEN IT DONE WAS to be geschah- lest charged fire inciting, for fear even that the flames would consume the next - had Labneh- and shisha pipes restaurants opened, talked and were considering depressed with the inaction.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it fell Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words that had just sung her Kevern, were each set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound of giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why would your father something should love?
He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to put in her presence again two fingers to his lips.
She thought already that it was a little weird.
"It seemed to him funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Keverns view.
It was all over the world to see nothing more than her unkempt black hair.
There was nothing he would not otherwise want to see.
"If you say so," they mean without conviction.
But that does not explain why you sing to me.
She seemed worried honest.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so not right.
Maybe your knuckles, a little bit ...
And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I do not hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That did not sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
If he was trying to be funny, he brought himself often in trouble because he does not like his father had the soothing charm, the one needed to tame the inherent cruelty in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted, Kevern, be.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her deck chair, threw to the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderflower wine, so was drunkenness is no excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I'm attracted to you pervert," she said ...
Except that I'm not.
He felt sorry for, both because of the unnecessary rudeness of his words as well as the fear that showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
She thought that he would beat them?
She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it is essentially so was like here.
Here, the same huge and icy ocean broke down as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and morose after what had happened as it had been their ancestors as a smuggler and beach robbers moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise his hand against a woman who refused to join them or ridiculed ,
Dick head?
They would have shown her a thick fist when she was not looking!
They snog only - smooching was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - they smooch first and then beat.
After Keverns view that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching itself already constituted an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him through her a sign to go.
He rose from the deck chair like an old man.
She felt too leaden, but the force of his sadness surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They knew each other hardly.
She watched him as he walked away - like from a room upstairs while her companion was watching him - man, weighed down with something that he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had their hands raised against them.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated without fighting spirit - why that was a sight she seemed to know well if you still could not remember a single time, in which they anything like this before had seen the day before?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked down at her feet.
Several years ago the just told incidents worked Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, on a short presentation about the continued violence in low- and middle-level in exactly those areas, where the reduction, if not elimination have been, most likely to occur, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already done a lot, and a lot remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people led thousands of wars and most of them won, especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country, in where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically despite the towering steeples between the hedges rarely felt.
But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the lower the passion he still wakes.
The population is crying while listening to sentimental ballads, drunk with stories about Overcoming difficulties and asserts firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only keeps the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and sneaky contentiousness at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor, when he had read the whole report.
I suggest that you read less fiction.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I think that I need not say," replied Esme walnut.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme invoked their right to privacy and denial of testimony.
Feminist?
More silence.
"I do not ask that," Luther Rabinowitz said finally, "because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve an unprejudiced society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which is absolutely acceptable and laudable in itself, can occasionally results as you imagined it, distort.
They themselves have obviously prejudices against the Church, and those things that you describe as "sneaky" and "raw" could of course strength and vitality are interpreted by others as well as an expression of.
If you continue on the harping, what will happen is when it happened is as if it, if it had happened would have happened yesterday, means the country to take its essential vitality.
Esme walnut looked around while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head a repeated LED lettering in Flamingo Pink the advice that Ofnow had left the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.
Smile your neighbors, you cherish your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to you, you agree to excuse yourself.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand completely, what are you getting," Esme Walnut answered in a calm voice, as if she was sure that her boss had finished speaking, "and I say nothing more than that we are not healed as effective as we delude ourselves.
My concern is that we might find there again without warning us, as we repeat the mistakes that led only to what HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED ever.
This time there are not the other, where we leave our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
In order to imply patience of a saint.
"You go too far," he said, "if you act as a" call errors "who our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You go too far, if you say that they had omitted their "anger" and their "distrust" of "other".
It should not be necessary actually to remember someone in your position that we and "others" speak in understanding the past as in the protection of the present, not by "us".
There was no "we" and there were no "other".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From when we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "can claim no part of society, to have behaved well.
I accuse no one.
Whether it was done badly or well, what's done is done.
That was then.
This requires nothing more to be said - because we agree.
And must be assigned to exactly how not to blame, as well as any debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.
But what is the past if we do not learn from it -
The past is to ensure that we forget.
If I may say something to -
Luther Rabinowitz let coincide his pyramid.
"I will consider their report," he said, and dismissed them.
The next day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was passers as described, driven in a "brutal anger" on the footpath.
Coincidences there.
