Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure
A US federal judge on Sunday stopped provisionally the implementation of a law in Louisiana, said of the lawyers that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which has been made into law by Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June and September 1, will come into force, would doctors who perform abortions, compel a patient enrollment right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
The decision of the judge, however, means that doctors can continue for the time being legally perform abortions, while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiff may lawfully continue to work, as they strive to obtaining these rights," wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment.
Within a month a hearing for the judge is set to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors would gain more time in order to gain admission to hospital privileges.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana missed a sneaky law that will take them their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued on behalf of three of the five hospitals of the State had to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment extended also to the doctors of the two hospitals that had the action not connected and also requested briefing rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, which courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that most of the remaining hospitals in the state have been forced to shut down, stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Gynecologists and Ostretricians and the American Medical Association agree in saying that briefing rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions.
Abortionists response to this is that the measures are designed to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of hospitals.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has, over Patienteineinweiserechte, said the Center for Reproductive Rights.
If all the other doctors in the state to be forced to perform any more abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out of fear for his safety, the operation, the group said.
In their argument against the judgment said representatives of the State of Louisiana, that they would punish any doctors for performing abortions, while their applications were pending on patient referrers True.
