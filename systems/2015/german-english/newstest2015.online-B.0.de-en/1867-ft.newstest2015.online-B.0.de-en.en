Berkeley declared housing market back to "normal"
One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing market in the south east of England was again "returned" to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly coveted and the subject of enormous price increases, which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear moved in front of a credit bubble to put ceilings on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013", adding that it provided a "stable task environment".
The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn, as foreign buyers thronged to the capital.
According to information from the land registry, the prices have risen in the metropolitan area alone last year jumped by 18.5 percent, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student services rose by about one-fifth last year and were the end of April to Â£ 423,000.
A stronger pound has however made less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months real estate property in London - some of them have been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "Villas control" before the general election next May.
The London Estate Agents Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, were presented in the stricter lending rules, would in the second half also lead to lower market growth in terms of real estate sales as in prices.
New data from the Bank of England released on Monday showed a decline in the mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market cools.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, downgraded its prediction for the rise in house prices in London in 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price consciousness.
The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington is now every year declined by a quarter, so the broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, because the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than 2.2 billion pounds.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the forward sales have remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 percent annually to 280 million pounds, while sales rose 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.
In an announcement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley would probably meet the current market expectations for the current year.
Analysts estimate consistently the annual pre-tax profit to 450 million pounds.
Berkeley shares were fixed in the afternoon London trade at 23.96 pounds.
