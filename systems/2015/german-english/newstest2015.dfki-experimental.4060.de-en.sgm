<seg id="1">Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a proposed law in order to build the organisation of trade unions as some civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="3">'Die as trade unions, die the means class jobs,' Ellison said, a democrat in Minnesota and deputy chairman of the Progressive people in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud, together with the citizens right icon John Lewis the employees empowerment law.</seg>
<seg id="5">This landmark law gives workers the same legal opportunities in the case of discrimination because of the Organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and forces in such a land unionized stopped.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of national work right law, in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organise a union representation in order to bring a complaint before a civil court for justice - and in order to obtain compensation or penalty - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is not a radical initiative with security - at least not according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact the best kind and manner for the sense of what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back for a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">In spite of the setbacks to whom the trade unions were misfired in the last years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states in the whole country - Americans encouraged once countries in all world to acknowledging stretching and stopping industrial law.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time which millions of Americans still remember, when this country mentioned democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the union right in a breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When Japan filled the United States after the Second World War, general Douglas Mac Arthur and his stick encouraged the country to adopting a constitution which is supposed to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full consciousness of that, that the workers and their trade unions during the creation of a new Japan took a role, they used a language that acknowledged explicitly that "the rights of the workers to union and common negotiating and action are guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States fill after the Second World War Germany, general Dwight David Eisenhower and his stick pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would provide that that the fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact, that the workers would have to organize, and should rise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a stipulation that testified explicitly: "The right to base unions around which Work and economical conditions to safeguard and to improve is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.</seg>
<seg id="15">To curtail it agreements that restrict this right or are aimed at that are zero and vain; measures being aimed at that are unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship about the International Human Rights Commission from which the General declaration of the human rights was projected as it was taken over in 1948 of the United Nations as a worldwide agreement Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to the protection of his interests or to join them."</seg>
<seg id="17">Since generations Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">As this country other countries in this case advised as one can shape civilian and democratic societies Americans declared that the right to the foundation of a trade union must be protected - and on this trade union may participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent significant partner with enterprises and government places then.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights is turned out in America under fire, indeed very points to make clear the American ideal, therefore, the working population must be right to unite and voice to be heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">How pastor Martin Luther King, Jr., who said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">The story is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now they all know that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but extended it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Through the increase of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market in wondrous way for the industry and raised the entire nation to inconceivable production levels.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but the story is preserved.</seg>
<seg id="25">The history remembers, and we should also do that.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition the industrial law as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination during the creation of employee representations - is for a long time overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which made America big in the past and kept the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Richter stops law temporarily, that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing</seg>
<seg id="2">A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana, from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state, temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the judge means, however, that the doctors for the time being legally abortions continue to carry out, while they can apply for such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs can continue working law-consistently while they are making an effort to obtain these rights, wrote federal judge John deGravelles in its judgment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within a month will be set a hearing for the judges, for the law in order to bring about a more permanent decision.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Meant" the present decision that the women escape "in Louisiana" "an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them", Nancy Northup, president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law, said.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion supporter and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association say that investment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents argue that the measures are used for the protection of the health of women, although some welcomed the effects of a closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who carries out in Louisiana abortions, has Patienteineinweiserechte, told the Centre for reproductive rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore, this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Their argument against the judgment said representatives of the State of Louisiana that they would punish no doctors because of the implementation of abortion, would be during their requests for I way rights still pending.</seg>

<seg id="16">A majority of my life it this serious form in the corner that read the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father, but it won an insight into how the life may have been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark to buy, deep stygische labyrinth 84kg with fire and smoke and a great deal of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I pictures there, it was clear to me that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him was greater.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you".</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when it was my mother against the end of their lives badly, we began to "I love you, I love you, I love you to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">By its own daughter Billie, with Dawn, he was able to share the love that he had missing as a child.</seg>

<seg id="42">Henrys career change is perhaps in his elegant, a Bart.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since it was praised by the critics for his Othello, it is captured by the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">This was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">That is another experience than the sitcoms and dies that filled its occupied working life.</seg>

<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he people imitation and wrote to New Faces about it.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the middle of the 1970s. "I was the only black clone / comedian on television for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public, but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 with New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had, a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black Henry performed his Comedy there more than five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">That was very unpleasant to my family.</seg>
<seg id="54">I wish somehow that it would be never happened, but I do not regret that I have done.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I have worked in giant projects and have learned how to deal with a large public.</seg>

<seg id="60">After that, a documentary number came to radio 4 with the title What "s So Great On...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first consequence turned around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class, whiteness, in tights and a cabbage in front in that.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had big fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All of us who for the show interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said 'you should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Do not make it bad if you do not know what they are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Take a few words in their mouths, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could create.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone would have put me on its head correctly.</seg>
<seg id="71">"For that it works, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, investigates a little.</seg>
<seg id="72">The tests were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash, and this happened not easy.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he was in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment, as I thought, 'Oh, you have changed.'</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to maintain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">A small voice said to me, 'You must bridge 10 minutes now, while they are dealing with the computer. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the scene and anything in me said 'Oh, thank God'.</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You plays in a play, in other words, in your role. '</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>

<seg id="90">So I will say it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love that.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be a test.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has, however, the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while he is imitating persons again and again.</seg>
<seg id="94">I decided not to make any Stand-up-Comedy because I believe that this type of immediate satisfaction of a Chamber is somehow dangerous to full foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="95">If one is looking for that, it is in this way to a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I perform sometimes live in the Apollo if I fancy for this purpose, but in total it does not give to me so much as formerly.</seg>
<seg id="97">I would like to ask him whether he will make a Stand-up-Comedytour ever again.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun that I have in an area with a director, which helps to craft a start, a central part Member and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever like to give up again.</seg>

<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The confidence works in two directions: Towards inside onto the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, however also to the outside as a voice of public concern and noise if the things work wrongly.</seg>
<seg id="13">That guarantees for an almost untenable duopoly, the need for a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>

<seg id="32">Jazz was not played even if it was not directly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvising was not more modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was only room for a single "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a sort of tune, where it would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just as the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability made the people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically expressed intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he had become 10 years old, without Sammy Davis junior to have heard something about jazz Kevern, knew from the half secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, at least it did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">In their age, it could not recall a time when pop singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, was no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A consistent society meant, that every element of this society agreed thankful the principle of the group talent - thankfully as the ones spared to from the fate.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with Afro-Caribbean origin were appropriate by temperament and build for entertainment and sports, so they sang and they go.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who came from the Indian subcontinent initially were blessed as of the nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of guaranteeing that no family without functioning engineer 's order wire unit telephone stayed.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was still remaining from the Polish community cared around the canalization; what was remaining from the Greeks smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country rapidly than what happened when IT happened happen- for fear of being accused of fire fuelling, even for fear that they would use the flames next - was Labneh- and exposed to Shisha bidding restaurants, views and with the inaction depressed.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his skills.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because they had heard only ballads Ailinn, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that you are Kevern premixed, art, had ever.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">'The are not really offensive,' Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose feet are too large.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never offended someone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He spake too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">The sound absorption of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves could not overcome anything.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still not understood.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why your father should have loved something like that?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a, however, hesitated to lay in its present another two finger on the lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">You already thought that he was a little strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">'It seemed to him,' he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">You thereupon read their heads and impeded Keverns point of view.</seg>
<seg id="62">It did not admit anything else on the whole world see, as their uncombed raven hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing, what it otherwise would want to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say it", she thinks without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not declare why you vorsingst it to me yet.</seg>
<seg id="66">It seemed honestly worried.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too large?</seg>
<seg id="68">He saw this again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so directly.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">But that is only the stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He would have been able to say 'I love you, but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you made me," he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That did not ring correctly.</seg>
<seg id="79">It had to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">If he tried to be funny, he often in trouble killed himself, because it did not have as his father, the soothing appeal that would be needed to control the cruelty inherent in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps, Kevern that he wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="83">In spite of his friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their deck chair, made the console and shed the wine that they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elder flower wine, so binge was not an excuse for him.</seg>
<seg id="86">In their excitement seemed to tremble, palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">'And your fat head is precisely the reason why I am perverse, "they said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">It did him, both because of the tired of unnecessary werent of his words, as well as the fear, which showed in their eyes, as they revolted against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think that he would beat it</seg>
<seg id="91">It had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he did not have any doubts that it was like this basically as here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and hard ocean broke up here and there on the shores</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more vexing after DAS what had happened than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach Snatchers, drew from bar to bar, always ready to raise the hand against a woman, who rejected them or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stubborn person?</seg>
<seg id="95">Those ones would have shown her a thick fist if she did not look out!</seg>
<seg id="96">You first smooch - Smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote for the meaningless love ballads from the console - with her first smooch and beat then.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to Keverns view that was an unnecessary processing since the smooching represented even an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons admitted a sign to him through their body go.</seg>
<seg id="99">It rose from the beach chair as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt also leaden, but the impact of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">But you knew.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched to him, as he left - so as from a room in the upper stick their companion watched him during that - a man, burdened by something that he himself had caused.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">You felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some of their hands against they had made.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from it bent his back, abashed, conquer, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that it seemed good to know, when they could remember nevertheless not onto an only time, at which she had seen something like that before the present day already once?</seg>
<seg id="107">When it was again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Many years before the just reported incidents ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher working on a short speech on the continued violence in the task of Ofnow, the non-legislative surveillance control for the public mood, on low and middle level in the regions in which to expect their reduction, if not abolition, at the most, in view of the money and energy that the eradication of this power had been invested in.</seg>
<seg id="109">"It has already done a great deal, and a great deal still needs to be done," she wrote "in order to placate the inherent aggressiveness of a nation that led a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet whiff of human kindness was feels historically, despite the church towers emerging between the Hecke rare.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties turn out as ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the church tower, it seems like this, the passion in a the smaller way that it keeps on waking.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries during the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicates with histories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family lives firmly, however, nevertheless only the former brutality does not hold the rural municipalities just the same as our urban structures do in the hand, but there are also proofs for the origin of a new and insidious belligerence at home, at the job, on the streets and even on the grounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said their mentor, when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">ESME Nussbaum bowed their head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: Are you atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think I do not need to say", ESME Nussbaum answered.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again ESME referred to their right to privacy and rejection of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not ask," then Luther Rabinowitz said "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a prejudice free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">However, specific types of hypersensitivity that are completely acceptable and commendable in themselves can distort on the occasion of results as you adopted it.</seg>
<seg id="126">You yourself have prejudices obviously against the church, and these things which you refer to as "insidious" and "raw" strength and vitality could be interpreted by others just as well than expression of one of course.</seg>
<seg id="127">When one rides out wider on the, what happened if IT has happened as if it would have happened yesterday if it had happened means, to take his essential vitality the country.</seg>
<seg id="128">ESME Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.</seg>
<seg id="129">Repeated behind his head a LED lettering in flamingo pink the advice that Ofnow the country in the last quarter century or longer had given.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile you its neighbours, value your partner, listen ballads, visit musicals, use their telephone, talk, explain, listen to you, you agree, I am sorry.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence is, the sung word is better than the written one is, but nothing is better than love is.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I understand what you want to absolutely, also," replied ESME Nussbaum with a steady voice, as I am sure she was that their superior to the end of had spoken, "and I say nothing other than that we have not healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves into thinking.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that we may recover ourselves without warning in how we repeat the mistakes that any first to DAS what happened when IT has happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time the others at whom we skip our rage and our distrust are not it, however.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In this way, the patience of then point out.</seg>
<seg id="137">'You go too far,' he said, 'if you acts as' mistake 'who have committed not our grandparents or perhaps also.</seg>
<seg id="138">And they also go too far, if you say that their 'anger' and the 'mistrust' to 'other' would have left out.</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not really be necessary to remind someone in your position that we in understanding the past as in the protection of the present, not by 'us' and "other" speak.</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were not any "else".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is what we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"Of that one if we are honest to ourselves ourselves" dared to throw in ESME, "to have behaved well," no part of the society can claim.</seg>
<seg id="143">I would accuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it badly or well what happened was done is happen.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">More does not have to be said with regard to that anything - there we agree agreed to ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="147">And exactly as no fault has to be assigned, so also no fault has to be paid off if such deletion would be appropriate and if it would give a way to wipe it out.</seg>
<seg id="148">But to what is the past, if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is designed to ensure that we forget about it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something about that.</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid falling down.</seg>
<seg id="152">'I will consider her report,' he said and sacked them.</seg>
<seg id="153">On the next day, when it went as usual to the work it was run over by a motorcyclist who had gone onto the footpath, described as passers-by, in a kind of "brutal rage".</seg>

<seg id="94">The boy, whose terrible image after the siege become a symbol of abominations of Beslan was</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today</seg>
<seg id="96">His face covered with blood was drawn from fear when he went to his life, while Chechen terrorists were shooting down its class, however.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped it off for his first school day before she hurried loosely in order to bring their older son Wladimir to the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the farm. For two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my small boy remained alone there for three terrible days' she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they have been killed all.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer we come to this date, the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not any single day, at which we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it long ago is, I believe that it would be done yesterday, some scenes from these days constantly follow me.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget, I can assure you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Powerful: The image of Georgij (to the left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (to the right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember, that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school. He said he wants to embrace his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew only that he was alive, when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also believe that the people in the world thanks to this image our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Mr says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever find out the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we find out ever what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world becomes something terrible.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years have nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years, around it one to forget little in a small way.</seg>
<seg id="121">It attacked my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years, I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went later in the year 2004 back in school and had every day fear.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates, which had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to say my old childhood friends toll.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is difficult for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have completed this year the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will become heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first election was a training in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not let this happen.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgij Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy lived, to feet, even though it was caught a murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to root of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is really a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it as if it have been yesterday", says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is not anything which I have let behind myself.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and people say that children can deal with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact, however I cannot forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I back into the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost the consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will return never again there and they do not ask me to show you where I was in this famous picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivors': Georgij Fanijew today, with a host of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think and speak or they never asked me after the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">I am well physically.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knees, but I can now go well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered, that it is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">The animals have been my second passion, so I went to the veterinary institution.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have already there two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats up to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: 'I knew that I would report back to my children never by my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain leaves me never.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse, if the anniversary comes closer.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations in memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgij will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be much more for him, because he was there and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited at home on him and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am God so grateful that it was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, it may sport, but it can not due to its knees.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operates on several occasions that he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he overcame the horrors to 50%, but one can never overcome that and forget that.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only increases my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the people killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families, in which new children were born, but also of widows, the never again have married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What do these people fight for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other.</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I can almost not believe that.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were formerly a friendly country, as it can be that we fight now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine have many children were killed and many be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we include and could throw out all these rebels, as far away as possible.</seg>
<seg id="188">Aljona Tskajewa, 10</seg>
<seg id="189">The baby who was borne movingly so by a special task force out of danger</seg>
<seg id="190">Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian special task force (to the left).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is now ten (to the right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.</seg>
<seg id="192">The world stopped in 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona was taken into the pauper of a Russian policeman by Beslan from the siege.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists made her go, but they held up their 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.</seg>
<seg id="195">Your father Ruslan got married since then, and has a little girl, with its new wife Svetlana that he named after its lost daughter Kristina.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and grew up to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.</seg>
<seg id="197">"You are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children", a close friend says.</seg>
<seg id="198">Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that approach with the tenth anniversary.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you wish to make photographs or videos underwater, there is a choice of equipment.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a watertight Point-And-Shoot, such as the Nikon AW120 or a Action-Cam as the first Hero3 + Silver edition, which are both for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have received these photos of a family party with several cameras available for a price of less than $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Put your camera on the photos or videos, which you want to capture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, you check until which depth your outfit is operative.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">You are multiple photos - because many will not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action-Cams usually not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to do so under water, and the right image attitude is a matter of chance.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you do many photographs</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done, you use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">You remain near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, they remain so close to the surface if you do photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">So you can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approach close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">The country is also a good Council under water, but it is all the more important because of the bad light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam: These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means, that you thicker onto your objects must, if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort that character changes things even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As a consultative but no anesthetic doctor he devoted his career to the task to be spared the sick both the agony of the disease, and the pain of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, so his wife remembers, a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors are the diagnoses and diseases important, whereas the next Generation offers mostly with something quite different: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel myself," he wrote in May this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to raise me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything more directly than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, lawsone fully felt unusually, and without reason concerns.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anything was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out a radiological examination of its breast.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago it had been in the French Alps for the skiing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was the result of the X-ray test.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, a incurable cancer, the breast fur, in other words the the lungs on drawing the end of skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, while some smokers are falling with lung cancer, all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not previously smokers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Mesotheliom is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is an asbestos burden - contact with the fibre material that was once seen as "miracle material but has now been recognised as serious</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, teambuilding is a disease that can ignore how easy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is, after all, a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Britain since the 1960 "s more than the industry has committed itself voluntarily to stop using this.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, where it was still used, only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers, building workers, carpenters and dockers for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a Mesoltheliom disease.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from teambuilding here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year twice as many people die from this disease than road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual figures Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in the United Kingdom</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are seeing the fatal consequences now, even though it is asbestos for years illegal (1999 have been banned all types of asbestos), is that developed a teambuilding only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is frequent still, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And that is why teambuilding knows no class barriers, financial borders, professions or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a harbor.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament building are asbestos contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy 's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital, where I completed my training for six years." He wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All - Students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many will be my age at the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately, he was unable to answer this question, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy 's hospital, and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years" he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one that still lives."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will fall ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">That was an unusually long survival time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease always ends fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only repeat Lawsons question: 'How many of us will fall ill?'</seg>
<seg id="53">The leading expert Britain "s to mesothelioma, a professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870-74 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in the United Kingdom is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90.000 of the disease will be the victims.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them have no idea at the moment, so that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">A asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A short look onto the files of the courts which the concerned persons turn to frequently because of claims for compensation shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June this year "s Marks & Spencer has, for example, too, to have stopped Janice of All negligently cast an air asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department in two locations - one of them the purchase in the Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allen was only 18 years as, when it began its work in M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now it has two children in the twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">In this matter, "says, 'I had never heard of teambuilding, I had not even really on asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that I would affect the.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the term asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name stems from the word 'Asbestiform ", a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistant and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six have been used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos today, is by far the most widely found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof plates, slabs, tube isolations, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less serious than other asbestos forms, but is regarded as a major health risk "with possible death by the EU and the WTO.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous is, however, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and that blue asbestos (Cape asbestos).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world "s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts believe that" it clear indirect evidence that this is a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten.</seg>
<seg id="72">A member of Marks & Spencer was taken in the flagship store in the Oxford Street, London, exposed to asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may have seen not as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their history is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected, in the is presented that 'was caused a substantial proportion of the mesothelioma without known suspension through work or in this House probably by asbestos contact in the environment'.</seg>
<seg id="75">A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It appears that no one can expect to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard consulting, the Palace of Westminster has investigated, shows how people in the heart of the government, unknowingly may have been exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard reported that the service formulating and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament with asbestos whose serious fibres could be caused by something as safe as "strong air movements" were contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of Parliament are accused often to look after their own interests, but it looks as if the opposite would have to.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a "clean health certificate", meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove, and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report also indicated that 'was not handled the presence of asbestos in accordance with the relevant provisions'.</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">Everything that can be done now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who was able to determine the contact with asbestos never exactly is Graham Abbott, a general practitioners.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson the 50 old Abbott suspect that it was stopped in its work in hospitals, the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints positive were decided," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and was late in the evening by an operation.</seg>
<seg id="90">I had suddenly joggling-frost.</seg>
<seg id="91">It was all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought not to get the trip left home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain of breast fur, the skin by his lungs came around.</seg>
<seg id="95">But how Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect, a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He was not a month to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, but without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health improved slowly, and it has returned to his job.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time the symptoms returned, however, often after sporting activity and violent terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="101">2011 was a patient Abbott "s with similar symptoms in its practice and has been diagnosed with teambuilding later.</seg>
<seg id="102">But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, its patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt for the first time ill, introduced a with a camera equipped probe in the between the music and the breast.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I am generally simple further, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest, I had not made me so many concerns.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was concerned.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the purpose: Lay in the week between Christmas and New Year: 'I was told that it was teambuilding.'</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnosis teambuilding</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos", he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people, that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped, fall ill now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And it is now teambuilding younger people who have worked in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals below the earth, so patients were not stopped the material</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, that changed into pedestrian Tunneling from a building into the other one (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as it often did to Graham Abbott), came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It shows that were for several decades after the war hospitals for patients may save lives, but slum-livers for the Firouz doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">It will also still today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant polyester properties often in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Also schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">The issue of asbestos is spoken about Web sites now often in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default.</seg>
<seg id="130">'It is a industry poison that is contained in large parts of our real estate,' noticed Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy 'has represented.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only way that a woman remembered was the dismantling of a garden box in the 1970 "s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So you look out as you tear down your garden box.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">A while regrets to process that ", Graham Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I noted that I could not focus on what I have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I am not going to further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rightly had to come.</seg>
<seg id="141">It was very difficult to include all of this, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor 'how long I still have?'</seg>
<seg id="143">And I was still around 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "Well, I am not going to further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was it then. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Teambuilding is particularly insidious, because it our lives conservation mechanism - the breathe itself - is that caused the fatal cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most of the cases of teambuilding are caused by asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of smallest fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is has caused and the fibres are inhaled, can they in the pleura, skin, by the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers", so professor Tom treasure, a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy 's.</seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital, of the Andrew Lawson believed that it has suspended the asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre in the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasury knew lawsone and dealt with some others that probably during their education in the hospital the asbestos were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric treasure says "where the skin is, if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge.</seg>
<seg id="155">By nature it is from the beginning invasive.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options on other cancers not work in teambuilding so good.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of a operation, for example, is hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies that.</seg>
<seg id="160">"One cannot cut out the pleura", he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You are not with the knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is not to chemotherapy very well, "the" effect ', but does not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long-term on living," says treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they die all.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients live long, in fact, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after its own diagnosis is fighting Graham Abbott still.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson, of the four years after its diagnosis a Check-In man support and consultancy for company had become Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">He imagined "Hallo, cancer headquarters," cheerfully in the case of calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier, and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Initially, Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles, which would last four months and likely to extend his life by only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">'I was desperate, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, was' things in a slightly more positive light '.</seg>
<seg id="176">After the consultation of several doctors Abbott, its treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, decided to continue heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage by the fact that I do not further had to be referred, I called simply and got a date," Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would must be given a reference and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to use the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments finally inevitably fail, many are affected by a different financial concern - on the future of the families who leave them.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they are directed to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health", says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what in the 1960 "s changed is that it was realized that was also a very low burden a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy was laid in their case, finally, but it was not what Morgan a 'full compensation', as has been able to prove not Lawson with absolute certainty that teambuilding be on a asbestos contact on Guy 'was due.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation on his death confirmed a spokesman for the Guy ', however, that' have been removed the asbestos fibres in the affected Keller area in the 1990 "s.</seg>
<seg id="188">This was for Andrew Lawson too late.</seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their previous employers have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are against claims, know that the time for it is, but certainly not with the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="194">As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law established a fund of 350 million £for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact, but not be able to sue anybody.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80% of what a court could have given to them in a normal compensation process - roughly 120,000 £.</seg>
<seg id="197">Some 300 successful applications in the programme are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan feels like so many Mesotheliom concerned that £350 million represented a 'very good work of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"That is a deal of insurers for insurers", he says, and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal.</seg>
<seg id="200">Also Mike penning, former work and retirement minister, admitted that the law is not "perfect".</seg>
<seg id="201">But both penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people suffer so much and need help today," said penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this point, Mr Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">According to their first deliberations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, of which he unlike Tom treasure a positive impact expected.</seg>
<seg id="205">This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40%.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">That is, of course, with the most important thing, he says.</seg>
<seg id="208">You can see that again and again in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something that you can continue.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you give up, you are feeling very quickly more bad.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott subjected himself to the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="213">After concern scans is showing no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There have been several cancer-spots by my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I became 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">That is life-ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott subjected himself to six chemotherapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now is not a trail of tumours more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is very hard physically and psychologically.</seg>
<seg id="222">You need to think of practical things - on the money, if I am not more, for example, or to my wife, as the storage water heater timing worked.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you get bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You must look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">'For parents is the difficult, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know what we should say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness with which I would not get old.</seg>
<seg id="229">You responded very different.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told it to their friends and we got soon many calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more cautious.</seg>
<seg id="233">You did not say a lot.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such discussions are something that have to go through all cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such conversations are not from hope pulled through, not of a track of hope for survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease brings (as end to Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refused Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retaliation</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the growing calls for democratic reform against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the electorate from Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="3">This procedure inspires presumably the long announced protests in Hong Kong 's business district while activists were leading the planning and mobilization for this purpose within less hours according to the announcement into the ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People "s Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle, all not Beijing loyal candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The is not unexpected, but it makes us but wroth," said right expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has lied to the inhabitants of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei, vicesecretary-general of the Constant Committee of the National Nation Congress, said that the admission of public nominations would be too "chaotic" at the choices for the government from Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain returned the control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing promised to make the people from 2017 choose the government presidency.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly through a nomination committee closely controlled by Peking in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to a new stipulation only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" are in addition supposed to be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer of some of the largest and most visible protests were to be held in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement occupy Central In Love and peace is that organizers has threatened to cut off the financial meltdown if Beijing does not allow any real universal suffrage</seg>
<seg id="15">At the Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had met within few hours according to the announcement in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration the organizers said that their movement have reached a new stage of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">You did not give further information to seemingly avoid by problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online communication the organizers informed, that the movement "the occupation of the Central District only when last resort took into account, an action that only then should take place if all dialogue opportunities are exploited and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry about having to say that all dialog chances were exploited today and the occupation of the central district will occur definitively.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have for days on the announcement of Beijing, and it were prepared on Sunday before the government buildings more stringent security measures including police forces and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The riots are supported by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are losing control of their city slowly.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, there is a growing fear that the values such as democracy and freedom of speech Hong Kong under the growing pressure of Beijing begin to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement since it endangers the business concern - the lifeline of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests that they speak of could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved in this and how long they last," legal expert Regine Ip said that criticizes the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to create any fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The from a government viewpoint controlled media of China reported also recently about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled from western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer organised activists an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights, which were attended by September people - more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands of one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize according to racial issue and police behaviors Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager became early this month of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. killed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands high, not fire" while they were waiting before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two week long protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience put white feminist commentators the sex before the race, when it comes to reproduction right and raise income disparities.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions were going up in the Middle west, however, and receiving country observation as a whole, Perez saw that the answers were about the race from white women to 100%.</seg>
<seg id="7">In comparison with the answers of black women shortly to the shots of the 9th August the personal essays with titles as "thoughts" came "of a white woman" to Ferguson "and" feminism does not turn only around the suppression from women "relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez that meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not believe that one finds many people in the feminism that be about the white and speak privileges in so highly class way she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt for this purpose pressed into squeezing out something for the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is typical of the crisis in which we are and because the situation in Ferguson lawmaker so that they must put it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio state University Ferguson problems onto the light to whom black Americans that, however, are considered not as "Woman topics" in the cultural room are abandoned every day brought.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something merry on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes here from everywhere", said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something over how colors stand in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">'How can it be for women sure to speak publicly about a relationship, but not on security in the public sphere?' She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women as Mitchell who studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA there is not any dichotomy between race and sex problems.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them black women do not have the luxury of clean, had to separate the issues; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are combining the topics now race and sex in the feminist main stream circles Angela Hattery, professor for women and sex research at the George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"In between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman", said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women have had to be involved in the history to justify the Lynch murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery the split came between white and black women at the point at which white fighters analyzed the country for the woman right to vote as Susan B. Anthony in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight could be successful for the right to vote only for in each case a group: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">'You made the decision to stand up for the right, and the right to vote for blacks should come later,' Hattery said.</seg>
<seg id="23">If one remembers such things, it becomes conscious to one with power why colored women do not trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We did not make our job good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also after women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was almost 40 years after the original request for assistance from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "call tracing call holds" played with the problems with which black women sat down from each other since generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It would be great if the activists, the feminist platforms traditional over such relief the right to education of a child so seriously would take as they did with the right to design control?" Mitchell asked.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation that based their career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means attempt to understand now what means that.</seg>
<seg id="31">The well-known white feminist activist of their children was two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and has published an article by Rebecca Carroll, certain dates only of the Guardian, which calls for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope for women who have an other, but parallel reason for understanding a danger being inherent in the body - and opinion on the race which are clearly different in public inquiries - mentioning the changes", wrote Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Even though Steinem for a more through feminism, be addressed in the race, as well as gender issues are perplexed by some of their comments on the race issue in America but.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina summer, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole feminism?" Said to She The People that young men in the United States, in particular young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson are contrary to its previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently a small programme, My Brother 's keeper opened, to vulnerable young black and to help Hispanic men, there was annoying reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that at the forefront of the mainstream feminism is pressing.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied capella minors at the southwest border of the country this year, also the topic of the immigration reform goes again onto the surface - this time as a woman topic.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chairperson of We Belong Together, of an organization which mobilizes women for the immigration reform said that for a new consideration of the topic as an essential woman topic she must publish only the histories of the immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the great majority of the work visas goes onto masculine immigrants, the women who accompany it are in a position in which they are sensitive to domestic power and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find a echoes in the women" s organisations, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington increases with the economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up, such an again published study in the last week, and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the area District, Maryland and Virginia paid 27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% against the revenues of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3% to 671 billion, compared to $3.9% in the year before, and it was the third growth year in a row decisions after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose to more than the local taxes, by 4.3%, so the study by the services agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation, was carried out of a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue of the District, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of revenue Mary ends up are coming from companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia is the least tax revenue with 28% of companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the increase in the tax revenue is justified in a recovery of the GDP of companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in the real estate taxes by 3.7% in this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits was coming from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to extend to Washington.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion at state and local property taxes in the last year, compared with $9.6 billion 2012 - an increase in a year by 4.2%.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland following happens: A big part of the real properties, in particular in the tax field around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that" do not "pay" any real property taxes, said Douglas to Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in the tax revenues by companies alone cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporate income also seem to recover, such as the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of 2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend is going into the same direction, the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly</seg>
<seg id="22">The increase in rate in the District was 4.3% with the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a average tax revenue from 4.1%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has by far the least corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates) with 6% in all three areas of competence.</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate in Maryland is approaching at 8.25% and the relatively high 9.975%.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year has shown that in Virginia smaller state and local corporate taxes are required, and there is a better overall tax climate than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study was not investigated the District.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina passed legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year of 6.9% to 6%, the same rate as Virginia, and the sentence will fall in the coming year to 5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the government continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state to 2017 apart from 3%.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems as though the small businesses in the room Washington better to leave, and they pay therefore more state and local taxes, such as the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes that are paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a temporary structure that most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year about 20% to 2.4 billion, a clear faster growth rate as corporate taxes as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">But the Washington area may lag behind if the spending cuts in the federal government for the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys $1.04 billion for With</seg>
<seg id="2">Ginebra has just confirmed, had reported what information on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a number of other things - is buying the video streaming service after for 1.04 billion ($970 million US $).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of shrug, but because it was assumed that YouTube would win the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of With to the video service of Google for a cool billion decided, and the cooperation also appeared of course.</seg>
<seg id="5">Shrug that only three years ago as Justin.tv was established had started as general Streamingdienst - a living version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch-interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And '1,081 play', a video genre, in which who preached the (mostly older) give a veneer of secret science theatre, are popular on YouTube already very.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is now the case that YouTube is often mentioned in order to describe shrug, so it has become the information that YouTube shrug wanted to buy, something boredly, a textbook example of an established engineering company that buys a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not achieved, since the company reportedly was prepared to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet shear, president of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret is, to be honest, the incredible success of With.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that, is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o 'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else, to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All these games could now just look at you.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games being ego-games today, so the watch without its own control of the look perspective can be a very good recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the rapid flows into which Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete whole games in record time, entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case, his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what skeptics know as I have?</seg>
<seg id="20">After is called of 55 million of different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult to imagine that is so after in instant Ginebra, after such as YouTube simply would have been able to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But after has something that would have every business: Thousands of young men, which are courted as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">How the chairperson of Twitch, shear, did not say yet Amazon and Twitch "believe both at the future of the gaming", "and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="2">The concept of the organizers was right.</seg>
<seg id="3">In spite of the strong downpour at the Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-celebration in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">The admission temporarily had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That was angry," said Ron SEM, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salt whisk l light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">Maxim Sachraj and Ron SEM formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Na, and the fun comes in any case of alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">That was proved already on the early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers had promised a party for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded in this.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply stands at the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler had it, but also guests from their immediate surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="14">You followed the first live appearances, bobbed with the foot in time, enjoyed cool drinks - shortly: Relaxation pure and was pleasure announced.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that right through the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While ones were lolling about onto covers on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar, other at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek refreshed, the junior staff raged on the hopping-castle that was a big attraction of attraction for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But also at the the voluntary helpers had to do all hands to child makeups fully in the truest sense of the word in order to become gentleman to the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The larger ones used the football player tables or participated in a skateboard-workshop which the Goodfoot-crew adjusted from Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was shortly before 5.30 p.m. on the visitors, particularly families were looking for the space and dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the attractiveness of this did not diminish.</seg>
<seg id="22">"More people came than expected," would say Ron SEM, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, nothing is opposed to a repeat of the major party in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although at content and size of the events must be done, SEM made clear in a first balance on Sunday to the people.</seg>
<seg id="25">He designated as annoyed, that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security company with too little forces have been booked.</seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="28">The resonance was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who romped in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the case of the audio engineering.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler vois recordable bloc "broke it from their appearance therefore folksonomies.</seg>

<seg id="35">The premiere night of the Amula-Open-Airs was from the numbers of visitors more than succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="36">And the in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers committed some errors which are still forgiven with the case of the first time, but were eliminated have had them with the case of the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the social network Facebook the organizers must take criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">'Sorry, but for twelve euros simply "expected' more 'Melanie Mary is expressed in the event.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have unfortunately taken a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not see the initial problems very so narrow.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is very good that not only embraces some stupid, but also really try to put something on its feet.</seg>

<seg id="11">So more quickly visible successes are to be made.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle friends were having a reconstruction of the castle around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath till the end at the mountain wood in mind, stands for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the ground at most front place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, Second chairman of the castle friends, was very pleased with the call.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death he heads the castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairperson is supposed to be found in the middle of September in a general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="16">At present, the association matters according to the 74-year long about 40 members.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we made the association activities out of respect rest first of all". This "thinking-phase" was necessary in order to "consider how it could go on".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl the new chairperson is supposed to go then into the conversation with the castle association.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then the castle friends could make themselves also a current atmosphere picture within their grouping.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is currently yet not a candidate for the chairmanship, says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone will find himself He does not want to present himself because he is domiciled in bad Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman of should be a Wolf Council.</seg>
<seg id="23">The year wants to participate in the project 'but very much like on'.</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view on reconstruction will probably be in the eyes Piffls next time.</seg>
<seg id="25">He recognizes Dimbath as a "missionary" who have always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">By a high level of participation of the population, as well as by voluntary workers from around the world, it is a tourism hot spot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was sceptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But, over time, I was convinced more and more that it is reasonable to advance the project '. An "alone position feature" can be created for the raft man city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here, there is nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the project would be funded by EU subsidies, public tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I personally do not want to fling the idea of the reconstruction simply overboard therefore". He hopes for the castle association moving in this point maybe a little.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their aim to document the history, first of all, 'is important and well ".</seg>
<seg id="34">After that, we could see.</seg>

<seg id="11">The result of his inquiries remained the very sober explanation for the name.</seg>

<seg id="13">At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the rise are supposed to have taken a rest.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demanded of Kiev the inclusion of 'national' talks with the eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin required under Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and take them immediately with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia, but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin "s appeal to the government to negotiations on an equal footing with the Russian insurgents, however, is on the since the beginning of the riots five months ago seems to be persecuted strategy: Assistance for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to allow place the newly proclaimed region Novo expo-centre de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television channel: Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern regions Donetsk and Luhansk that were adopted in March and April, Moscow was annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently held the area as' Novo expo-centre 'or' New Russia ', a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre center of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 images and during government groups civilian communities in the areas of separatists squeaker attack hope for early peace talks' trapped in their illusions', this.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must begin immediately detailed discussions, not only to technical issues, but also to the political organisation of society and the State of status of the South-East Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there, 'he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that had to be seen Putin "s reference to the statehood in the context of the greater autonomy, which will be discussed for months ago by the leadership in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that threatened their cultural and linguistic rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, 'because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin "s remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct Annektion of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million people are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million people no Russians and turned out from the time before the conflict a broad majority to remain in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships, and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the biggest area in Russia and the Crimea is, moreover, rich in mines, factories and foundry that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy seems in sharp contrast with those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, has been accused of their arming and incitement Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin "s last request to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders on an equal footing, followed an further encroachment of the rebels in the past week after that Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov in the eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations began to Mariupol, to strengthen a steel industry port with 500,000 people that lies between Nowoasowsk and close access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="23">'We are on the eve of the point of no return,' warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tanks pillars and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week in order to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
