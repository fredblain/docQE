Genetic trouble often wrongly diagnosed 
A Briton says she considered as a consequence of a wrong diagnosis over many years that she would die. 
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that it has to live only still few years after its having been diagnosed with another illness. 
She suffered in fact from the Charcot Marie Tooth illness (CMT) - a group of inherited troubles that damage the nerves outside of the brain and the spinal cord. 
Charity CMT UK informed that wrong diagnoses are a frequent problem with people with CMT because so little is known about this illness. 
About 23,000 people in Great Britain suffer presumably from CMT which can lead to motor troubles as muscle weakness, an unsure walk and curved toes. 
Ills suffer also from deafness feelings or pains. The illness is incurable and increasing, which means that the symptoms with the time become worse. 
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she suffers from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - an illness with very bad survival chances. 
Rodgers thought she would be in the rotation chair they 18 would become, and before their 30th birthday die. 
The mother of two children said that today is 51 years old: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same thing as the others. 
I fell constantly there and everything lasted with me longer. 
I could never drive roller skate or skateboard with the other children and was often teased in the school because of my kind to go and to walk. 
Rodgers said that she saw their sick person acts in the age of 13 years after several operations in defence of their Achilles tendons and lamination of their feet, had left the room as their doctor and read that she suffered from FA. 
"I felt guilty because I had been curious therefore I did not tell that to anybody, but I went home, searched for the illness in the library and wrote to the CO society", she said. 
When I received answer I was shocked and panicked frightfully. 
I thought that I would be in the rotation chair with 18 and would die with 25, and would lose all my abilities slowly between that. 
I defined that all alone with me and planned my own funeral. 
She said, als sie 17 became, she realized that their abilities had not taken off so strongly as she had imagined it and consulted their doctor. 
He simply got up, and embraced me and said, "my love, I do not believe that you have that otherwise you would be now already in the rotation chair." 
I believe, you have something by far less life-alarming. 
After some genetic tests CMT was found with it 
"When it declared me what CMT was, I felt myself as if I were a winner", she would say. 
Charity CMT UK started a CMT-Awareness-Monat in order to make attentive onto this illness.
