Leonidas asked into the gladiator arena 
Not only the gladiators stood ankle in the slush at the first Rhine wild boar Roman day in the recreational park. 
Nevertheless the attraction of the event was strong enough in order to attract far more than 1000 visitors yesterday that defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and be completely enthusiastic from the historical racket let. 
There was a colored round of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland. 
The martial fighter troop of the gladiator school of "Amor Mortis", who used every rain pause for demonstrating their robust combat art in the arena preserved with soft sand, was main attraction of the day beyond doubt 
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be humorous and competent presenter and sent his men after each other to the ring for the heroic duel in different gladiator types. 
First it was up to the "Provocatoren" with rectangular shield and Kurzschwert as well as football pad at the left leg and splint at the right arm. 
The "Essedarii" with breast-plate, short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection, followed. 
The appearance of the "Retiarius" who competed with the "Secutor" with casting net, trident and dagger and pushed the lad to ground after short fight was especially impressive. 
There the swords cracked metallically at each other, the shields schepperten and the throw lances flew humming through the arena, that one fear and bangs could become around the health of the gladiators. 
However onto those ones the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee an always attentive eye, had. 
"We wanted to make the roman everyday life revive again and make the culture of the Roman time erlebbar", explained the intention to Lorenz Euskirchen, chairperson of the organizer "Circle of friends Römerkanal", behind the racket. 
After two years of preparation time an "Oppidum Romanum", a roman city, became from the recreational park for a day as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage found in his greeting word. 
Finally the Romans did not bring only war and conquest in our region but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today. 
Remains of that were to be marveled at also at the Roman day, about instance "aqueduct marble" of the Roman channel bridge eleven meters high and 1400 meters long that some day stood at Lüftelberg. 
The Frontinus-society compared the water and energy supply once and now, and manageress Petra Fricke knew: "We profit today still from the knowledge from then". 
That confirms also diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rhine creek the measurement instruments' of the Romans as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra imagined. 
The Roman villa into rough drafts presented to Blankenheim and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the Original-Hypokauste, the hot air heating which once warmed up the Roman villa. 
Impressing also the footprints that had been left behind by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the kicks of clay before one burned these. 
In 2011 the office had dug up the remains of a roman villa for ground care of monuments with the case of the Rhineland country association in the trade park north in Rheinbach. 
One found encirclement walls of a building for farming for industry for trade building building with a drying kiln for the drying of grain and for the malting. 
The building probably belonged to a villa Rustica, an agricultural good explained the archeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser. 
She introduced a series of find pieces from these excavations in a glass showcase cabinet, under that a big plate, several fine glass envelopes as well as parts of a dainty necklace. 
The villa existed presumably from the first up to the fourth century according to Christ, up to the idea of the Germans in the then roman Rhineland, Morscheiser presumes. 
With it the children occupied themselves furthermore with the roman windmill game, similar to the present nine men's morris, or they wrote their names with metal styluses as once the roman pupils on guard boards 
At the state of the Roman thermal springs Zülpich the children mosaics themselves were allowed to put, make glass mosaics at the state of the glass museum Rhine creek and help themselves Nettersheim at the state of the Eifel natural center a heavy wheat mill of stone in order to mill the flour for a pancake bread or a muesli 
With the faithfully reproduced roman touring car pulled by two cold-blooded animals the visitors went through the recreational park and got in this case also past the impressive state of the Urban grammar school that "presented" the results of their "Roman project weeks" here. 
With a Roman week of the 13th to 21st September also the municipality guard mountain into that brings in Rhineland-wide called out Roman year 2014, that is supposed to remind Augustus of the death of emperor 2000 years ago. 
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger wandering-association, the partnership association and the amateur play circle Oberbachem among other things thematic excursions become, a lecture, cook evenings as well as leaderships for classes demanded and of the roman past Wachtbergs remind. 
In this case for example a roman legionnaire will tell about his work on the drafty guard mountain, plants than living monument introduced from the Roman time and a witty teaching-hour as regards nation communication between a group presented to Wachtberger "Germans" and consulted Romans. 
The Adendorfer elementary school dedicates itself within the framework of a project week to the Roman topic. 
With the Roman week the numerous ones are supposed to be done frequently but no more at first sight visible tracks of the Romans in guard mountain in an again learnable way. 
In the Wachtberger city hall a small presentation will remind of the find of the Berkumer matron sanctuary in the year 1879.
