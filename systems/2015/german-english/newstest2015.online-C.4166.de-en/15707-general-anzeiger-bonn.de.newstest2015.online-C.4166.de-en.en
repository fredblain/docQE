Glandorf resigns from handball national team 
Holger Glandorf will not play anymore for the DHB-team. 
The 31-year long one of the Bundesligisten SG Flensburg-Handewitt mentioned particularly sanitary problems for this decision. 
The decision was not easy for me, it matured over several months. 
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team" informed the world champion of 2007 on his Facebook-page 
It goes thus into the international retirement with a balance from 167 international matches and 576 gates for Germany. 
Because the throw-tremendous moving room player wants to go from Flensburg for the champion-League-winner still some years on gate hunt, it is not available now to the new coach of the national team Dagur Sigurdsson anymore. 
With the Icelander who announces his cadre on Tuesday for the international matches against Switzerland Glandorf led a "long and good conversation. 
His ideas and approaches inspired me just the same as they will inspire also my long-standing other players and my successors. 
But for my club I would like to be available healthily also in the next years, for that longer regeneration pauses which the current double load does not approve are necessary. 
The left-hander had had to fear quite his career end in 2012 according to a heel infection. 
Because of Achilles tendon problems it had been able to be handled by team doctors of the German handball Federal Government (DHB) with a cortisone syringe that later a strong inflammation had activated. 
An emergency operation and two more interventions followed. 
Then Glandorf had announced a complaint against the team doctor, the quarrel ended with a comparison. 
Twelve years Pro- and eleven years of national team career do not go past any body without a trace. 
I have some sanitary construction sites which I cannot ignore anymore. 
After the three infection-conditional foot operations that occurred in 2012 in short distances I have never gotten my blood pressure correctly into the grip. 
To that some other wear-conditional complaints come. 
Already at the beginning of the year I noticed that I can operate indeed my head, but" not "deceive" my body, declared Glandorf the magazine "Handball Time" in the interview. 
For a comeback it would be prepared only in the absolute emergency. 
"If all else fails, I am always conversation-ready", declared the twofold head of a family to the specialist magazine. 
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball at a hand. 
I must also say that I became also quite humble after my long stay in hospital in 2012, which affects my health. 
According to my career I would at least quite just like to be able to go. 
Next to the WM title 2007 and the profit of the champions League 2014 it got 2008 (HSG north horn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo) the EHF cup. 
In 2012 it safeguarded the Europe cup of the cup winners to itself furthermore with Flensburg.
