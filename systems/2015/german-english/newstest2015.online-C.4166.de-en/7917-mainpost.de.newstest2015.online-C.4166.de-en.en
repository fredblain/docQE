There is silence under this treetop 
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner Glück" on the last Friday. 
There are still several of these giant trees in the rural district, the shown copy is the "nanny-goat silence oak" above Unterweißenbrunn. 
A bumpy footpath leads up to the about 600 years old oak. 
It goes past Koppeln, basalt stone heap and Basaltsteinmeeren. 
A small piece below the quarry of the farmer mountain, a kilometer north of the street to wise creek there it stands 
The natural monument looks energetic, it projects over the other trees of the surroundings and it reminds of an American mammoth tree with an extent of more than eight meters. 
A small Buddha on a tree stump points at it being a question of a spiritual or mystic place. 
However, in spite of intense investigations there were only references to the name origin. 
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider consulted the Bischofsheimer archive extra and consulted older people from Unterweißenbrunn in order to find out which circumstance has it with the nanny-goat silence oak. 
The result of his enquiries remained the quite sober declaration for the name. 
Accordingly the goat herdsmen are supposed to have driven their animals until about 80 years ago onto the meadows arduously cleared and released from stones from Unterweißenbrunn. 
At the foot of the tree the animal guardians exhausted from the rise are supposed to have taken a rest. 
Meanwhile the field gained his importance back, because on the meadows goat herds graze in fact again. 
The field was in addition declared as the nuclear zone of the biosphere reservation, if Schneider kept on finding the way out. 
During the entrance of the stone crowds one should make however, caution prevail, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is some popular whereabouts also for common vipers. 
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree which, however, is a little hidden. 
Further ways are signposted, climb up the direction Hochrhön and invite to an extensive excursion 
Where does the water castle stand 
A water castle which is searched during our next task is to be found, however, rather rare in the height 
The reflection in the ditch gives already a good impression of the construction however, we have some historical constructions in the rural district, to which the building portrait could fit.
