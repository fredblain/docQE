Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort that character changes things even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS. 
As a discussing anesthesia doctor he dedicated his career to the task of sparing the sick people both the death struggle of the illness and the pains of the treatment 
Among his patients, so his wife remembers, a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects. 
Lawsone knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the doctors while the handled ones are being occupied with something very else mainly: Pain. 
One day in the year 2007 he was, however, that one whose ordeal began. 
"I did not feel myself", he wrote in May this year. 
I had picked myself up difficulties. 
While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently. 
"I want everything more gladly immediately than later", he noted down. 
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, lawsone completely felt ungewöhnlicherweise and without reason worries. 
Something lay in the air. 
He asked a colleague for carrying out a X-ray examination of his breast. 
Only two weeks ago it had been in the French alps for the skiing. 
There was the result of the X-ray examination 
He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer, that the pleura attacks, therefore the skin cladding the lungs. 
As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily. 
While for example some smokers are falling with lung cancer ill, all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not formerly smokers. 
But Mesotheliom is different. 
In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material that once was regarded as "Miracle material but meanwhile was recognized as fatal 
For most of us Mesotheliom is an illness that can ignore as easily. 
Finally asbestos is a product of the past. 
The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Great Britain since the 1960th years more than the industry committed itself voluntarily to not using this anymore. 
Also, where it was still used, only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers, building workers, carpenters and dockers for example. 
As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming. 
But this complacency is inappropriate. 
Great Britain, it seems like this, experiences today the climax of a Mesoltheliom epidemic. 
There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world. 
With in total 2,500 deaths per annum so many people die twice of this illness than at road accidents. 
Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and probable future deaths in Great Britain 
The reason why we experience the fatal effects now although asbestos for years is illegal (In 1999 all asbestos types were forbidden) that one is that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades. 
And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not open former worker of the construction branch restricts. 
Asbestos was, and is frequent still, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop. 
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class bars financial borders professions or age. 
The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter. 
The Parliament Buildings are asbestos-hot. 
Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen. 
Andrew Lawson was not old. 
He was not also a plumber. 
It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact. 
Then he found it out. 
"It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote. 
All - Students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels. 
One wonders how many will stand my contemporaries at the same illness? 
It could answer this question unfortunately at least in part. 
"From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy's hospital, and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years" he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one that still lives." 
How many of us will fall ill still? 
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years. 
When he died on 17th February of this year, he was 55. 
That was an unusually long survival time. 
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months according to the diagnosis. 
The illness ends always fatally 
We can repeat therefore only lawsones question: "How much of us will fall ill still"? 
The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, accepts that in between 1870 and 2050 in total 90,000 will have fallen victim to the illness if the asbestos epidemic will probably come into Great Britain for the succumbing. 
Most of them do not have any presentiment at the moment yet, that they will die so.

A short look onto the files of the courts which the concerned persons turn to frequently because of claims for compensation shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms is already spread. 
In June this year's Marks & Spencer gave for example too, to have stopped Janice of All fahrlässigerweise asbestos. 
It worked for nine years for the chain, of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible above the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street. 
Mrs. Only 18 years was to all than when she began their activity at M&S. 
Now she has two children in the twenties. 
"Before this thing, she says, "I had heard by Mesotheliom never yet I did once really not know something over asbestos yet. 
I would never have thought that that affected me once. 
There are only few people who know a lot over asbestos. 
Fact is, that the concept asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals. 
The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistantly and flexibly. 
Three of the six of them were used in the building trade. 
Chrysotil, also than white known to asbestos, the asbestos found today by far most frequent is in buildings. 
It was used for roof plates, slabs, tube isolations, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars. 
It is less fatal than other asbestos forms are, nevertheless is regarded, however, as "a great health risk" with possible death consequence by the EU and the WHO. 
More dangerous is, however, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and that blue asbestos (Cape asbestos). 
Great Britain was once the world-largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts presume, that "it clear, however indirect tips for this being a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten gives 
An employee of Marks & Spencer was stopped asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street, London, Alamy 
Maybe Janice of All Of It did not see himself as typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual under any circumstances. 
He presented a study of the concerned persons in which it is represented that "an essential part of the Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the house was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment." 
A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings. 
It looks as if nobody can assume to be secure 
A report by Goddard Consulting, who examined the palace of Westminster, shows, as people also in the heart of the government, unknowingly the material would be stopped could 
In 2009 Goddard told that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of the parliament with asbestos whose fatal fibres could be swirled up by something so harmless as "strong air movements" were contaminated. 
Parliament members are accused frequent to see to their own interests, however, here it looks as if the opposite would affect to. 
While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a "clean health certificate", meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £ of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove, and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster. 
The Goddard-report referred also to "the existence of asbestos not being handled according to the respective regulations." 
Nobody can know whether this Missmanagement will taste lives. 
All that one can do now is wait. 
A person, that the contact with asbestos never exactly is been able to determine Graham Abbott, a general physician. 
As Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott presumes, that it was stopped during his work in hospitals the asbestos. 
"I worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints were decided on positively", he says, "however I cannot prove it in my case. 
It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data. 
At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers. 
He was 45, and an operation just carried on late in the evening. 
Suddenly I had joggling-frost. 
It came very suddenly. 
I felt terrible. 
I believed not to get the journey anymore home. 
As a doctor Abbott knew, that the pains of the pleura came, the skin around his lungs around. 
But as Janice of All Of It he did not have any reason to presume a Mesotheliom. 
It did not go a month to work 
Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab. 
His complaints remained, however, without diagnosis. 
His health improved slowly, and it returned onto his job. 
From time to time the symptoms returned, however, frequent after sporting activity and vehement buckling. 
In 2011 a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms came in his practice and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom. 
But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case. 
Finally his patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos. 
The connection in the case was clear. 
In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group. 
In December 2011, exact two years after Abbott for the first time had felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera into the cave became between the Rib- and the pleura introduced. 
I am an optimist. 
I continue mostly one-times", he says. 
Honestly said, I had not made myself as many worries at all. 
But Rachel, my wife, was worried. 
There was the result of the biopsy weekdays between Christmas and New Year: "One said to me that it was Mesotheliom." 
Graham Abbott: Diagnose Mesotheliom 
Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney. 
Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic. 
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos", he says. 
The people, that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped, fall ill now. 
And so Mesotheliom hits now younger people who did not work in the typical professions. 
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay under the earth, therefore patients were rather not stopped presumably the material 
But many employees, that changed into pedestrian tunneling from a building into the other one (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as it often did to Graham Abbott), came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances. 
It it proves that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients possibly life-saving were, however, life-alarmingly for the handling doctors. 
It is removed also today still. 
Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats. 
And it only hospital does not affect. 
Asbestos was used due to his fabulous isolating and flammhemmenden properties frequently in offices, businesses libraries and municipal halls. 
Also schools. 
In fact many people had presumably the first asbestos contact in the classroom. 
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats. 
The topic asbestos is spoken about web pages now frequently in schools. 
And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default. 
"It is an industry poison that in big parts of our real properties contained is", notices Andrew Morgan, the lawyer that Andrew Lawson represented Hospital in his process against Guy's. 
In a case the only contact which an affected woman remembered was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970ern. 
Therefore you look out as you tear down your garden shed. 
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge, that the illness is incurable, is immense. 
A while regrets to process that", Graham Abbott says. 
I went again to the work and attempted to make wider, however I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did. 
I was two weeks in the practice. 
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself myself. 
Na yes, I will not experience any further Christmas. 
With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient. 
As countless patients in front of it he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rakes had to come. 
"It was very heavy to record that all", he says. 
"I asked to my doctor "how long has I still"? 
And one gave me still about 12 months. 
I remember, that I thought, "Na yes, I will not experience any further Christmas. 
That was it then." 
Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - the buckling itself - that the fatal cancer causes. 
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact. 
Asbestos consists of smallest fibres. 
If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibres are inhaled, can they in the pleura, the skin around the lungs around, set. 
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations. 
"The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers", so professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy's. 
Exactly the hospital, presumed by the Andrew Lawson, that it has stopped it the asbestos, is now ironischerweise, a leading center during the treatment of Mesotheliom. 
Treasure knew lawsone and handled some others, that presumably also during their training in the hospital the asbestos were stopped. 
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric Treasure says "where the skin is, if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge. 
By nature it is from the beginning invasive. 
The usual options with the case of other cancer illnesses do not function at Mesotheliom so well. 
The effectiveness of an operation is for example hotly controversial. 
Some mean, that they is an attempt worth. 
Treasure denies that. 
"One cannot cut out the pleura", he says. 
You do not avoid that with the knife 
Meanwhile the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy very well the "effect shows", however, "not cures. 
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors, says Treasure. 
However, at the end they all die. 
Fortunately some patients long live in fact, much longer than expects. 
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years according to the diagnosis. 
Two and a half years according to his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights. 
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultation office four years according to his diagnosis for coaffected ones. 
He imagined "Hallo, cancer headquarters," cheerfully in the case of calls. 
"It was very positive", says Abbott. 
He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very much active 
Initially Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles which would last four months and probably prolong his life only around a month. 
"I had despaired", he says. 
I wanted to give up. 
Lawsone managed "to make "appear" it, however, "the things in an a little more positive light." 
After the consultation of several doctors Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, decided on continuing heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy's. 
"We had an advantage through my not having to be referred, I simply called and I got an appointment admits Graham. 
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and to have to wait for the permission of the treatment 
Money is decisive for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies. 
But if finally these treatments fail unavoidably, many concerned persons of another financial worry stand - over the future of the families that leave it behind. 
And so they are directed to the courts in the hope for compensation. 
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP. 
"It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health", says Morgan. 
But what is changed, that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk. 
And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role. 
Finally Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital settled their case, but it was not what Morgan mentions a "genuine compensation" since lawsone could not prove with absolute security that his Mesotheliom was to be put down to an asbestos contact at the Guy's. 
After the investigation for his death a speaker of the Guy's confirmed, however, that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar field in the 1990ern were removed." 
That was too late for Andrew Lawson. 
How asbestos can be removed 
It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents. 
Many of their former employers are sold or closed. 
Insurance documents can disappear. 
And definitely those ones that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for them, however, with the complainants 
As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore. 
The law established a fund of 350 million £ for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact, but not be able to sue anybody. 
In these cases the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £. 
About 300 successful requests with the case of the program are expected per annum. 
Andrew Morgan thinks as so many Mesotheliom concerned persons, that 350 million £ represented one "very good work of the insurance branch. 
"That is a deal of insurers for insurers", he says, and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal. 
Also Mike Penning, former work and retirement minister, admitted that the law is not "perfect". 
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily. 
"The people suffer so very much and need help today", said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of the last year. 
To this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski. 
After their first consultations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expects a positive effect of unlike Tom Treasure. 
This was accompanied from a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40 percent. 
Abbott felt fortified 
"That is natural with the most important thing, Abbott says. 
One sees that again and again with patients. 
There is over there something which makes you continue. 
If you give up, you are feeling very quickly more bad. 
Graham Abbott subjected himself to the operation in March 2012. 
At the end of August he had the last one of the six chemotherapy cycles behind themselves. 
Nachsorgescans did not show any sign of the illness. 
Then I had in March 2014 a Scan. 
There were several cancer-spots around my breast. 
I became 50. 
That is not life-alarming. 
That is life-ending. 
Again Abbott subjected himself to six chemotherapy cycles. 
Now no track of the tumors is more visible. 
But the process is very hard physically and psychologically. 
You must think of practical things - above the money, if I am not more, for example, or to my wife show, as the storage water heater timing functioned. 
If you receive bad news, you become negative. 
You must look forward. 
As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy. 
"For parents that is heavy", he says. 
It is heavy to know, what one is supposed to say and how much. 
When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness with which I would not get old. 
You reacted very differently. 
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous. 
She told it to their friends and we got soon many calls. 
Ellie was more reserved. 
She did not say much. 
Such conversations are something, that all cancer patients must go through. 
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such conversations are not from hope pulled through, not of a track of hope for survival. 
The illness brings (so as end also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security
