Harburg: Tents for new refugees 
At the new countries place are put refugees now in tents. 
The Central initial incorporation for refugees in Harburg bursts from all joints. 
Now the inside authority made three tents of the Red cross next to that be set up. 
The district politicians were informed first shortly before - they are enthusiastic to little. 
"These beating-jerk actions keep on stirring up reservations of the citizens and do not give the district politicians any possibility to participate in the humane accommodation of refugees constructively", says for instance Britta Herrmann, faction chairperson of the greens Party, in the Harburger district meeting 
Your party demands that the district administration Harburg provides currently unused houses for the accommodation. 
96 refugees can be placed in the three tents. 
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial incorporation are the rush of seeking help - and the circumstance, that the authorities cannot provide places sufficiently in consequence facilities 
Many refugees remain therefore longer than the regular three months.
