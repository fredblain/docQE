Delayed diagnoses and lacking access to the best treatment possibilities lead to higher death rates through ovary cancer in rural fields. 
Angelina Jolie and their brother James set a Videohommage for their mother who passed away in 2007 at ovary cancer in an online way. 
For women in the rural fields of Australia a higher risk exists, to die of ovary cancer, than for women in cities. 
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians with whom in 2005 ovary cancer was found, and stated that only 25 percent were still at the life five years according to the diagnosis. 
The chief research officer Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research institutes said, that for those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk during the study lay about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas. 
SMALL STUDY: New drugs could slow down pulmonary and ovary cancer 
The researchers examined the medical care of the women more than seven years. 
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman with the case of the diagnosis, the type of the ovary cancer, existing Vorerkrankungen as well as the social and economical status influenced also the survival chances. 
For older woman and that one whose cancer had continued to the diagnosis time already further the survival rate was lowest. 
For those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk lay during the study about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas. 
Although the study did not examine, why outside of the city living women with higher probability at ovary cancer died, Dr. Jordan presumes a late diagnosis and the lacking access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for that. 
"This illness is handled best by gynecological oncologists, and these are to be found mostly in bigger cities", she said. 
In spite of the improvement of the telemedizinischen services in order to counter the distances with something she suggested a strengthening of the service of doctors flown in as possible remedy in order to give specialists the possibility to look after women more thickly at their place of residence as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region 
Dr. Jordan said, that the study showed a bad long-term survival rate independently of the geographical status with women in the ovary cancer and underlined it the need for better treatment and provision strategies. 
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia. 
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the gold coast, found out that she had an aggressive form of ovary cancer.
