Merkel speaks command: Toll will come "very clearly" 
Now the chancellor stands up once again clearly for that. 
A charter for all complicated details is not it, however. 
Stubborn objections from the CDU against the car-toll angered the CSU rapidly. 
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke a command to continuous resistances from their CDU for the introduction of a car-toll. 
"In order to say it very clearly: It stands in the coalition contract, and it will come", said the party leader on Monday after meetings of the CDU top committees in Berlin. 
Merkel did not commit himself to a detailed model for the time being, however. 
In the black-red government program "certain parameters" are mentioned. 
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) "did a proposal and that is "weitergearbeitet" at now". 
The NRW-CDU insists, however, on their refusal of a toll now on all streets. 
Merkel stressed, also Minister of Finance Wolfgang Sch채uble (CDU) brings in constructively into the consultations for a bill. 
Beyond the topic he talked with Dobrindt also about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure about instance also during the broadband expansion. 
"There nothing special is at all "at that". Sch채uble had let on Sunday a "mirror" report uncommentedly, his house examines an own draft in order to compensate highway investors with toll gains - after the choice 2017. 
CSU leader thicket Seehofer warned then before developing in the cabinet toll draft against the responsible minister. 
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections. 
"The coalition contract never came from that, all circular and federal streets too bemauten", the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairperson said. 
In this respect it is an important signal that Seehofer announced now to talk about the topic once again. 
Baden-W체rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate comes to resistance to the plans also from the CDU country associations 
Apprehensions are background, that a toll influences the small border traffic to neighboring states. 
Seehofer had demanded coalition faith because of the toll criticism from rows of the CDU. 
The left winger regards the plans as failed faced with the quarrel in the union. 
"The fiddling-toll is dead", said party leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neuen Osnabr체cker newspaper" (Monday). 
"The minister fails with the toll". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German streets which is supposed to start in 2016. 
Domestic car owners must not be burdened according to coalition contract, however, besides addition. 
Therefore they are supposed to receive a full compensation for the toll about the car-tax. 
The model must not put foreign drivers at a disadvantage, however, according to EU right because of their nationality.
