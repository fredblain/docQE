4 tips for better underwater photos and videos 
If you liked to make photos or videos underwater gladly, there is a selection of devices. 
The most economical option is a waterproof Point-and-Shoot, as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition that to have both for about 300 $ are. 
I received these photos at a family celebration with several cameras which are available all for a price of less than 350 $. 
Independently of the outfit there are a few rules for the best results. 
Control your outfit twice. 
Even if you have a waterproof camera, you assure, that the battery chamber and other compartments are thick locked up. 
Put your camera also on the photos or videos which you want to receive. 
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions. 
And before you jump in, you check until which depth your outfit is operative. 
Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet. 
Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models. 
You do multiple photos - because many will not bang. 
Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action-Cams usually not. 
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to notice this underwater, and the correct framing is a matter of luck. 
Therefore you do many photos 
If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done, you use it. 
You remain near the surface. 
The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface. 
If possible you stay therefore close to the surface if you do photos in a pool, a lake or the sea. 
Through that you can bring also more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the little color you become see. 
Approach close to the objects. 
That is a good council also ashore, but it is the more important underwater because of the bad lighting conditions. 
It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam: These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means, that you thicker onto your objects must, if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame.
