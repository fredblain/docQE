Israeli children return after the war to their schools in Gaza 
Dew senders of Israeli children from the fields near the Gaza Strip returned on Monday to the schools after they had spent the summer in air-raid shelters while missile and mortar bombardment was coming down onto their municipalities during the 50-day long war between Israel and the Hamas and they were remaining the schools in Gaza locked while the field was recovering from the fights. 
The school start brought a feeling to the municipalities drawn from missile bullet-hole holes from joy and expectation in the south of Israel, but the signs of the fights are still fresh. 
In the southern city of Ashdod employees of the "Pashosh"-kindergarten which was hit by a missile removed shell splinters from the walls and shifting-walls before the arrival of the pupils. 
"We are afraid a little, but we are excited", said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Saad and nonlocal English teacher. 
Many children from our area need urgently the return to a routine. 
Your 11-year old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funnily" suddenly again to go into the school. 
"Those ones were difficult times, and we did not go at all from the house", she said. 
President Reuven Rivlin went to the Kibbutz near the border to Gaza, in order to offer his support. 
Until an armistice suspended the war last week thousands of inhabitants of the border municipalities as Saad in their houses stayed or their houses left in order to keep on moving into more secure areas away from Gaza and to escape the missile and mortar fire. 
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the border to Gaza in which a 4-year old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell still hesitate with the return. 
The Ministry of Education informed, about instance a dozen families is yet not returned. 
Your children were placed temporarily in other schools. 
A school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is heavily drawn from the Palestinian bombardment visited prime minister Benjamin Netanjahu. 
It appealed to the children, to learn a lot and said "we will provide that, that you gain knowledge and offer you security 
Israel and Hamas agreed on the last Tuesday on an unbefristeteten armistice. 
The truce guaranteed for an immediate end of the fights; important problems remain, however, unresolved, as the demand of the Hamas for a cancellation of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and lake harbors in Gaza. 
Israel demands a disarmament of the Hamas and the delivery of the corpses from two Israeli soldiers killed with the case of the fights. 
A new round of indirect conversations will probably still begin in this month in Egypt. 
In the war more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children after estimates of the Palestinians and the UN. 
Israel denies these information and reckons that it is a question of fighters with the case of at least half of the killed ones did not present, however, any concrete proofs of these information. 
On Israeli page 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, a Thai worker. 
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired off 4,591 missiles and mortar shells during the fights onto Israeli cities, most in the south of the country. 
Meanwhile the Israeli military led more than 5,000 Air- and other attacks through. 
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gazagebiet and about 250,000 people searched refuge that preliminary shelters were altered into in more than 100 UN schools. 
While tens of thousands are keeping on living from people in the shelters and the fights lasting, the education authorities postponed last week the beginning of the school year. 
"I hope, the school is soon again opened so that we keep on being able to learn so as the children in the world and the Jewish children", Mohammad Amara, a 13-year old boy that currently lives in a school in Gaza city, said.
