Children need roots and wings 
44 years it was in the teaching profession, of that 23 as headmasters. 
From this time Manfred Richter knows many stood Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils. 
His methods were sometimes unconventional, however, always taken from his aspiration to see the human being in the pupil. 
The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the giant mountains. 
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home. 
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/north Bohemias, today Trutnov. 
Already with 14 he was interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school. 
A year after that the Sudeten German ones were expropriated. 
Within half an hour the family had to leave their house. 
After some months in a warehouse it went in 1946 to Bavaria - in the good freight car carriage. 
So it brought judges into the upper-Franconian depression village. 
The teacher education occurred in Bamberg. 
For this purpose Manfred Richter six times weekly had to run ten kilometers to the next railway station, go going with the railways according to Bamberg, there three kilometers crossways through the whole city to the school and in the evening back. 
After two months Manfred Richter got a sleep occasion in a red-cross-home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 schoolmates in a sleep hall. 
In 1951 it did teaching position candidate the first and in 1954 after three years the second state examination. 
Since Oberfranken did not have any free teacher place for it he applied after upper Bavarians and came on 1st November 1954 onto the school in Kollbach. 
The "young woman room" was his first "official residence" in the school building. 
In 1958 he got a three room official residence in the again built teacher house next to the school. 
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school had been solved in Kollbach 1968. 
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Peter beluga five. 
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Peter beluga in the present city hall. 
When the school association Indian village was based, only still the elementary school stayed in the place. 
In order to escape a moving-graduation in the now smaller school, the former rector Georg Sigl changed according to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor. 
However, Peter beluga increased, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 could get the present construction which was expanded in 1997 after Richters superannuation. 
Manfred Richter praises the simple generosity of the former mayor Ludwig Götz, that additional on municipality costs a craft room and build 1997 cellar rooms during the enlargement made although that was not subsidy-capable to the guidelines for school constructions 
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", remembered judge thankfully. 
In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech contribution of a government representative which had answered a paper of a school council on right and justice: "One must never forget the love". Manfred Richter transformed, what it had belonged to there as a young teacher. 
"One must give the children two kinds: Roots and wings", the today 84-year long one says. 
And he had to find out: "That does always not succeed". Whether it means only his pupils or just the same his own six children there is not very clear. 
Always Richters actions were sometimes unconventional. 
If pupils fought, they did not get a punishment work from it and did not become either the Nachsitzen verdonnert. 
At the expense of the municipality Richter had made buy two pairs of boxing gloves and made the two opponents be lined up against each other even if there should be once in this case a violet. 
For the welfare of the school Richter maintained a good relation to the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as a rector. 
This convinced the independent judge of that after his superannuation, 1996 at least than last to run for the district council on the CSU list. 
However Richter was dialed on place six and the CSU joined.
