Matthies means: Highest time for the great cross-linking 
Faced with the galloping technical progress that it threatens to change our comfortable into High-Tech control rooms home our columnist Bernd Matthies with some extremely familiar electronic accessories comforts himself. 
While I am writing that here, my look falls onto the coiled cord which unites the listener with the telephone, and I think: Boah, as retro that is then? 
But a consideration is behind that: If the cable was not, all listeners would fly around in shortest time in an abandoned way in the house, and that would be still significantly more retro. 
Anyhow is valid on the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen? 
No, typographical error: electronic) sector the rule, that the world novelty is the electroscrap from today from tomorrow, bought - goes out of date. 
And who has a tube television set for example today still in the living room, that one only says in this way that he refuses television fundamentally. 
Why these considerations? 
Because the pushing of the Ifa makes our absolute incompetence to us clear again at the radio tower in this week in questions of the electronics. 
The layman who mastered formerly washing machine and CD Player blindly does not understand today even the purpose of the devices which are spread with incomprehensibly vain Expertensprech in front of it "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promise us the press office. 
It still works? 
Over what one is supposed to talk to people, the apparently voluntary such curd expand? 
Basically it is a question for about 20 years particularly of our being supposed to cross-link our house most pleasingly. 
So that the yogurt itself reorders itself so that the fire detector on vacation informs us on the Maldives that it burns in the study grad. 
And it would not be wonderful, when we from the office the air-conditioning onto our quick arrival...? 
Yes, however, an air-conditioning presupposes that. 
But a dream is completely determined soon true: We lift our wristwatch say to her according to "Sucking!" - and at home the vacuum-cleaning-robot sets off. 
Mad people. 
Everything does not come to anything smaller than a revolution does: "The borders between white and brown product become blurred", a branch expert whispers, one can connect the washing machine with some headphones, who sends to steam the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven, what, however, does not use anything because we stand in the jam. 
From the daily practice we in addition know: If a fashionable device is once really needed urgently, is guaranteed the accumulator empty 
What a further reason for that is that the coiled cord will survive also the next radio shows at the telephone.
