Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $ 
AMAZON confirmed just what information had told on Monday morning: The online-retailer - and video producer, and a great number of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US-$). 
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was presumed to a large extent that YouTube would gain the enterprise. 
Three months ago it looked like this, as if the sale of Twitch were onto the video service of Google for one cool billion thing decided on, and the cooperation appeared also natural 
Twitch that only three years ago as Justin.tv was founded had started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube. 
Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider. 
The Twitch-interface. 
And give "let's play", a video genre, to the (mostly older) games in the smart aleck one painting of paint of hermetism theater, are on YouTube already very much popular. 
It is now like this that YouTube is often named if one wants to describe Twitch, therefore it became the information that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, something boredly picked up, a textbook example of an established technique enterprise that buys up a potential competitor. 
It is a puzzle why deal with YouTube was not achieved to that one since the enterprise was ready to pay so much as Amazon according to reports. 
All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly." 
A further secret is, honestly said, the incredible success of Twitch. 
For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that, is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand. 
It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else, to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty. 
All these games could now just look at you. 
Another problem lies in many of the most popular games being ego-games today, therefore the watching without own control of the look perspective can be a correctly good prescription for headaches. 
I add, that the quickness flows into which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete whole games in record time, entertaining are. 
But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case, his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting. 
But what sceptics know as I already of that? 
Twitch is called of 55 million different visitors monthly and the fourth-biggest source of internet traffic peaks is. 
And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that? 
It is heavy to introduce oneself that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed. 
But Twitch has something which would have every enterprise gladly: Thousands of young men who are umworben as advertising-customers. 
How the chairperson of Twitch, Shear, did not say yet Amazon and Twitch "believe both at the future of the Gaming"," and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport.
