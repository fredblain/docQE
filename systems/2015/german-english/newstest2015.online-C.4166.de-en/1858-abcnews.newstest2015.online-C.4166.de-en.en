Perry from Texas says that reducing tweet was not authorized 
A tweet of the official user account of the republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a reducing remark on the democratic district state attorney that stands in the center of a legal accusation against it because of abuse of the office power 
The tweet was put out later and user account was compensated for it by another from Perrys who denied the previous one. 
Just a tweet which was not authorized by me was sent from my account. 
"I do not approve of the tweet and deleted it", it was said in the later information 
Employees of Perry did not answer inquiries for comments immediately. 
Although the tweets of Perrys went out official user account, it was not clear who in fact helps himself the Feed. 
In the former tweet a disadvantageous picture was drawn of the district state attorney of Travis county, Rosemary Lehmberg that was condemned in April 2013 because of drunken driving. 
Perry inserted a veto against a financial promotion of their office when she refused to resign which led into Austin for an accusation against Perry - who could be a premiership candidate possibly in 2016 - in front of a gravel jury this month. 
The text of the tweet says: "I do not go always drankly with the triple permissible alcohol mirror ... however if I do it, I governor Perry accuse if he blabs it out." 
I am the drunk democrat in Texas. 
Lehmbergs office was not the gravel jury with the management about the investigation against Perry entrusts. 
This was led to a special public prosecutor from Michael McCrum from San Antonio, who was selected by a republican judge. 
Perry pleads on not guilty and the accusation named a political trick. 
His highly class team of legal advisers applied with the judge entrusted with the case, to reject the accusation and argued, that the law with which against the service-oldest governor in the history of the Texas state is proceeded is unverfassungsgemäß diffuse. 
Perry stopped 7.5 million $ of state money onto the Public Integrity Unit of the state - that is resident to County in Travis and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas - than Lehmberg refused to resign. 
This veto guaranteed for a public complaint on the part of a left watchdog-group. 
Perrys official user account is updated frequent - and sometimes famous. 
After it had closed with the case of the election meetings in Iowa during his premiership candidacy 2012 as Fifth, Perry understood on speculations that it will stop in his posting a tweet of a photo of themselves while jogging near a lake with the words "South Carolina, we come"!
