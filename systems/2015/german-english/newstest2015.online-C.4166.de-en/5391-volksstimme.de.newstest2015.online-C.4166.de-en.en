On the hopping-castle during the castle garden party some was on Saturday rid. 
The draft of the organizers was right. 
In spite of the strong downpour at the Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans came to the Open-Air-celebration in the castle garden. 
Temporarily the admission had to be stopped. 
"That was annoyed", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers. 
Salt whisk l light and fun. 
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words. 
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening. 
Na, and the fun comes in any case of alone. 
That was proved already on the early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves. 
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations. 
And they succeeded in that. 
Around the supply states on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearer and wider surroundings had made themselves cosy 
You followed the first live appearances, bobbed with the foot in time, enjoyed cool drinks - shortly: Relaxation pure and was pleasure announced. 
And that right through the generations. 
While ones were lolling about onto covers on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar, other at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek refreshed, the junior staff raged on the hopping-castle that was a big attraction of attraction for the smaller guests. 
But also at the the voluntary helpers had to do all hands to child makeups fully in the truest sense of the word in order to become gentleman to the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces. 
The larger ones used the football player tables or participated in a skateboard-workshop which the Goodfoot-crew adjusted from Salzwedel. 
Until the big rain came. 
Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it beat down onto the visitors, particularly families searched the Wide and Dry one. 
This did not do any breaking off to nevertheless the attractivity of the celebration. 
"More people came than expected," would say Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line". 
Therefore nothing is opposed to a repetition of the great party in the coming year. 
Although at contents and size of the events must be worked still, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday opposite the nation voice 
He designated as annoyed, that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped. 
The security company was obvious with for few strengths booked. 
The consequence: Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground. 
The resonance was very good. 
In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who romped in the castle garden. 
There were problems with the case of the audio engineering. 
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-band Blocks'n'Rox aborted their appearance therefore in an enervated way. 
The technicians were not in the situation to create a to some extent reasonable Sound. 
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to salt whisk because of a puncture. 
"In the next year they" will "be", however, in this case", according to the organizer. 
The premiere night of the Amula-Open-Airs was from the numbers of visitors more than succeeded. 
And that with the case of bad weather. 
However, the organizers committed some errors which are still forgiven with the case of the first time, but were eliminated have had them with the case of the second edition. 
Also in the social network Facebook the organizers must take criticism 
"Sorry, however for twelve euros one simply "expected" more", Melanie Meier is expressed on the event page 
"You overstrained yourselves unfortunately a little", thinks Ele Zimmermann at same place. 
Others do not see the initial problems very so narrow. 
I find it very good, that not natter some only stupidly, but attempt also really to put something on the legs. 
Guard off"! Stephanie Jen√ü to the Amula writes. 
Now the organizers have a year of time in order to stop these criticism points.
