In one they all agreed agreed to themselves, however: It did fun. 
Thomas Studanski might have slept last night well. 
Because for the first time in his life the head of the Oberurseler brewery went onto the field mountain yesterday with the wheel. 
For the good purpose. 
He can wegstecken the small muscle ache there easily, especially it the participation in the 8th cycling onto the Big field mountain for the benefit of the association "Help for cancer-sick children" (Frankfurt) also personally a valuable discovery has brought. 
A fabulous thing. 
"I know now, that I that can - excellently!" 
Small Päuschen on the way in the applause curve? 
Nee, if I had stopped once, wär's from been... 
As Thomas Studanski, who is in the Oberurseler city parliament for the CDU, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday to shale in the morning dew and arrived the exhaustion near, but happily on the plateau.

Also it drove the stretch in a slide, as also Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel that had made itself together with Frank Grüneisen onto the way. 
For the two tri-athletes the "field mountain cycling" was absolutely not a sporting challenge: "Here it is a question of Charity, there we are gladly with in this case - we" would have "done" an exit" today anyhow", according to Kuhn. 
On the way they had hit Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.

It must be that also, because it was with the "Fixie wheel" on the way, those ones are indeed also racing cycles, however without switching 
Not only the 20 hikers who climbed about the White Wall and the fox dance to the peak but also a jogger who dragged along a car tire with weights at a cord behind himself proved that it went loosely also without wheel up. 
Mountain guard doctor professor Volker Lischke said that guaranteed for security with his team, equipped with space wheel Bully and Quad: "The kenn" I from Frankfurt, that trains for a specific Schlittentrail only that he simply pulls the sledge himself". The man is therefore in a way his own sledge dog.
