Putin demands the photo from Kiev from "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with east Ukraine 
The Russian president Wladimir Putin demanded according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and incorporates them immediately with negotiations for the "Staatlichkeit" of the disloyal region 
His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia, but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region 
Putins appeal to the Kiewer government to negotiations on eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents matches, however, the strategy since beginning of the outrages five months ago apparently hunted by him: Help for the separatists while taking from fields and pressure on the Ukrainian government, around the again proclaimed region Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of making possible with the west. 
In an interview with the state television broadcast station channel One Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the moving-conquest of the fields held by separatists in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, that in March and were taken April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18th March. 
The Kremlin and the separatists referred in last time to the taken field as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a concept that reminds of the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire. 
Putin referred, that all those ones, who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the choices on 26th Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian municipalities in the fields held by separatists hope for quick peace conversations "in their illusions caught" are, told Itar-Tass. 
"We must record detailed conversations immediately, not only to technical questions, but also to the political organization of the society and the state status of south-east Ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there" he said. 
It said to Peskow that Putins reference to the Staatlichkeit in the context with the greater autonomy which is discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months must be seen in order to dispel apprehensions in Russian-speaking fields that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered. 
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields, said Peskow. 
It is not a question here of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said "because it is not a question of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but around an internal conflict in Ukraine." 
The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of the "faulty interpretation" of Putins remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia with the case of the contact with the separatistic rebellion in the east unlike the direct Annektion of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians. 
Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million inhabitants no Russians are and turned out inquiries from the time in front of the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine. 
The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships, and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea. 
The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea. 
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is in addition rich of mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military. 
The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages. 
But his idea of autonomy seems to support in sharp contrast those of the Kremlin and the separatistic rebels whose armament and Aufstachelung Moscow are reproached. 
Putins last request at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels in the last week after Russian troops and tanks about the before peaceful region along the Asowschen sea penetrated east Ukraine. 
The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk. 
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations started, around Mariupol, to fortify a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula. 
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine. 
"We to stand shortly before a point at which there is not any back anymore" warned Poroshenko. 
There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine. 
The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis. 
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated the Donezkregion last week in order to support the besieged separatists, said colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev. 
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers to be included into Ilowajsk by the Russian idea were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers that a week ago had been taken caught on Ukrainian field, Lysenko informed on Sunday.
