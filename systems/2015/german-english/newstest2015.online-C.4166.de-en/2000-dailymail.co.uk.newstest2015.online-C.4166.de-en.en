The hell decade of the survivors of Beslan: Ten years have gone by since the frightful siege of the school as the children involved in that suffer today still. 
Ten years ago more than 1,000 people were taken into Beslan by tschetschenischen militias in a school in south Russia as hostages. 
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, became in the three day long martyrdom, that the world shocked, killed. 
We returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom. 
Exactly a decade after the horrible siege of the school of Beslan at which 334 people died under that 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night in front of a new apocalypse in Ukraine. 
Caught to Kinder and to parents on 1st September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, as fanatic Islamic terrorists took and killed, that as the worst thing of the evil shone. 
The tragedy united west and east in disgust, and changed then surprisingly into action and hope for the future right in the worst misery. 
Ten years later we returned according to Beslan in order to find some of the victims which had escaped the death with the case of the atrocity in the classroom. 
We found surprising young people who overcame resistances although she will hunt the memory of this terrorist hell forever. 
Your greatest hope? 
That the war that afflicts Ukraine now - and in that children as they die - now an end finds. 
The girl who was photographed during the attempt to climb back into the zerschossene school gym 
It became photographed by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she attempted only in their underwear to climb back into the zerschossene school gym after a mine had exploded. 
Completely confused Aida searched for their mother Larissa, now 40 years old. 
They both were held for dead, but they survived. 
"A woman said to me I am supposed to run around my life, however, I could not," Aida said then. 
My legs were covered with blood. 
I got up and climbed again in in order to search for my mother. 
A soldier saved it 
To a series of operations she held herself for completely cured said, however, yesterday: Three months "ago the pain returned. 
I fear that I must be operated on again. 
Some shell splinters are still in my knee. 
It is your objective now to become dentist in order to help the people as she was helped by doctors. 
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me", she says belligerently. 
"That happened to me, and one cannot change that. 
Once per year I always go into the gym in order to remember those which stayed there. 
My friends and I attempt not to talk about that on other days. 
The pain is too great. 
My best friend and future class comrade Dzera Gapoeva was killed there. 
We played together when we were small, and dreamed about going together to the school. 
"I do not want to get married until I end my study and begin my career. 
I think of a family later. 
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it although the memory becomes every year a little weak. 
I am glad, that many people still remember our terrors on the world and we are so thankful for the help that we received from people in Great Britain and everywhere here. 
If I in an online way see the photo from myself as I climb back into the school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to something like that not happening again. 
The boy who fled through the ball hail in the opinion his mother is dead 
It was his first school day (Russians go with 7 years into the school) and survived the three day long siege in the arms his mother Tamara. 
As seven year long one he said: "Mama said to me I am supposed to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold their hand." 
After an explosion he thought she would die. 
She said with regard to it "Race 
Full fear it can be dead, he fled and a crying small child saw on the way, it took with the case of the hand and fled through a ball hail. 
His father Wladimir, that his son outside into the arms closed, said: "Damir said to me that his mother died. 
He said: "I could not save it 
In reality had stumbled according to Tamara outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, for her part their part in the assumption that their son died. 
After their reunion she said: "I cried with joy. 
I could not believe it. 
He ran in and embraced me. 
Damir was flown to London later (of the meanwhile dissolved newspaper news of the World), in order to keep from the former prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's champion. 
"This horror pursues you every day, however I wanted I could "stop" with the remembering", he said yesterday. 
But I can say that it becomes paler in my memory. 
I still know that I threw away all my toy pistols directly after that. 
However, now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that is not a problem for me. 
"I am not afraid of going back to the gym, but I do not think about myself myself. 
I remember these children with whom I played in the yard and who did not get it towards outside. 
We never say that they were killed or are dead. 
We say that they stayed in the gym. 
I remember very well my journey to London, especially at the game product cases, where I could select myself all which I wanted, and the journey in an above open car. 
However, now he is afraid around place as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune which it and his friends suffered. 
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted I could stop remembering that. 
"I am sorry about it so around all those ones that suffer from the Greueln", said Damir that last week worked as a volunteer in a cloister. 
I want to help so gladly. 
I want to go one day to the police and hope for their taking me next year at the training academy. 
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that? 
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply not any children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months. 
She remembers lively their journey to London with Damir. 
The people in London cried when I told our history 
I understood then how people on the other hand of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support. 
It was thankful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in the fall 2004 to Cherie Blair and to their foundation 
I wanted I could call Cherie and simply say to her that 10 years went by, however, myself I me still onto the meeting me it and her husband in London remember, and as the Damir and me has helped. 
I still remember as Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch gladly and they called all local Russian restaurants. 
I remember as he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir fired with his water pistol onto them and they ran away and they played with it 
And that was only a month according to the horror. 
I was surprised, that the Britons in a so inclined way divided our pain and supported us. 
She said: "I always think that this world did not become better during these 10 years. 
In Ukraine the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed. 
Those ones are exactly such children as ours. 
I think that for many the war is a part of the news which they hear if they are bored or occupied with something else. 
I simply know what these people feel the whole horror. 
And I cannot stop with feeling that. 
Nothing changed, the people want to kill themselves still mutually and that is so sad. 
Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, it is not aggressive or furious at all. 
He does not search for example for revenge it is not overwhelmed by the last Greueln. 
I know that he does not remember that gladly, but he has six narrow friends from the class and they go sometimes into the gym and they light candles there. 
When it was smaller, he suffered from that - I remember as he laid onto the sofa sometimes, turned away the face from us, for hours. 
Not sleeping, his eyes were open. 
I also still remember, as it all his arms and other military toys away flung. Damir is now 17, larger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy. 
I can hardly believe that I was so secure for some hours that it is dead and I would never again see it 
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and the hell looked around me around, with parts of the body lying around everywhere. 
I was completely secure that my small boy could have survived in this hell impossibly. 
"I remember, that I called out to him, "Damir, run, run away", however I was also so secure that he had not heard me. 
But he heard it and he ran away. 
And so the life, different than that of many others, for us goes wider. 
Georgij Ilyin, 17 
The boy whose terrible picture after the siege for the symbol that one became horror of Beslan 
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today 
His face covered with blood was drawn from fear when he ran around his life while tschetschenische terrorists were shooting down his classmates. 
His picture was one of the schockierendsten symbols for the barbarism of Beslan. 
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped it off for his first school day before she hurried loosely in order to bring their older son Wladimir to the university. 
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my small boy remained alone there for three terrible days", she remembers. 
Not very alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were killed all. 
Only my Georgij created it, survive. 
The nearer this date moves, the heavier it is, to think of that and to talk about that. 
There is not any single day, at which we do not remember this tragedy. 
We do not think that it is long here, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me continuously. 
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise that to you. 
Insistent: The picture of Georgij (to the left) was one of the schockierendsten of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (to the right). 
I remember, that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school. He said he wants to embrace his teacher. 
I knew first that it was at the life when I saw it on televison. 
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino. 
Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf. 
I understand that, but I also mean, that the people in all world thanks to this picture our pain feel. 
Georgij says today: "It is important, that something like that can never again happen. 
"I doubt that we ever find out the truth. 
The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth. 
And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine. 
Will we find out ever what caused it? 
This world becomes something terrible. 
"I cannot understand as that is possible, because if you ask to the people, nobody wants a war, therefore as happens that? 
Ten years are not anything at all with the case of such pain. 
We need dozens of years, around it one to forget little in a small way. 
It attacked my health and I still feel it. 
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better. 
I went later again in the year 2004 to the school and had every day of fear. 
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed. 
For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer. 
I want to mean my old childhood friends toll express. 
It is heavy for me to go into the gym, but I must do it. 
I do not feel as a victim this history is now a part of my past. 
I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself. 
My life goes on. 
I finished this year the school and go to a medical college in Wladikawkaz. 
I will become heart surgeon. 
My first choice was a training in the army. 
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not approve that. 
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen. 
Georgij Fanijew, 20 
The boy who survived who being caught to feet of a murderous terrorist 
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to feet of a murderous terrorist, but it managed to survive. 
During the siege it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist. 
It is really a miracle that it was not killed. 
"We feel it as if it have been yesterday", says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege. 
It is still with me, it is not anything which I have let behind myself. 
I am now older and the people say that children can deal with bad experiences easily - I must say that is not right. 
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact, however I cannot forget it. 
And I would be forgotten gladly. 
In 2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only times, that I went again into the gym. 
I lost the consciousness. 
I will return never again there and you do not ask to me please, to show you where I was in this famous picture. 
Survivors': Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop 
My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me. 
My friends know, that I do not think of that gladly or talk about that and they did not ask me ever for the school. 
Physically I am fine. 
I should be cautious with my hurt knee, but I can walk now well. 
But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted. 
I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered, that it is not possible. 
The animals were my second passion, therefore I went onto the veterinary institute. 
I have two years there already behind myself. 
He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats up to cows". 
He said: "I knew that I would never report my children about my experiences. 
About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either. 
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain leaves me never. 
It is in my soul, worse, if the anniversary comes closer. 
I will go for the ceremonies for the memory. 
I know that Georgij will not go. 
It must be still much more vehement for it because it was there and I not. 
I waited at home for it and could not help. 
I am God so thankful that it was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn 
It remains in us. 
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it 
It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one. 
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot participate because of his knee. 
It was operated on multiple, he cannot run, but not do any sport. 
I would say that he overcame the horror to 50%, but one can completely never overcome that and forget that. 
This terrible experience will always follow us. 
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that intensifies only my pain. 
I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me. 
My son is with me, and that is the biggest present that God could do to me, however, my heart cries around the killed ones. 
I know about families in which new children were born, but also about Witwen who never again got married. 
It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that. 
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital. 
And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions 
What do these people fight for? 
Why do they kill themselves mutually 
The war is now very much near to our country and I can almost not believe that. 
We were formerly a friendly country, as it can be that we fight now? 
People and children suffer, I am secure that in Ukraine already many children were killed and still many are killed. 
If we grasp and could throw out only all these rebels - as far away as only possibly. 
Aljona Tskajewa, 10 
The baby who was borne movingly so by a special task force out of danger 
Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is saved by a Russian special task force (to the left). 
It is to now ten (to the right) and does not remember the cruelties at all 
The world stopped in 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona was taken into the pauper of a Russian policeman by Beslan from the siege. 
The terrorists made her go, but they held up their 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty. 
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, however Aljonas of mother and sister died in the murderous massacre 
Your father Ruslan got married since then again and has a small girl with his new wife Swetlana, that he named after his lost daughter Kristina. 
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and grew up to an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say. 
"You are now a large happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both splendid children", a narrow friend says. 
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories which approach with the tenth anniversary. 
You will understand, why.
