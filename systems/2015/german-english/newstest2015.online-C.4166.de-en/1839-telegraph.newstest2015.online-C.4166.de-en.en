With Rona Fairhead the BBC found maybe the splendid director who she needs. 
It arrives with a proud fame train from the bank world, the media management and the internal circle of the Tory-party. 
And she has own front experience. 
Your career began with the case of the worldwide management consulting company Bain and Co., on which she changed ICI and the media world to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, from Pearsons. 
She was for seven years an executive board chairperson of the Financial Times and resigned when the uppermost post of the mother enterprise Pearsons went onto a younger masculine colleague. 
Your compensation was supposedly almost 1 million £. 
Also their political ranking is sound. 
She was recommended David Cameron of lord Browne to the former chairperson of bp than this searched for more private-economical knowledge in Whitehall: she became the adviser of the cabinet. 
Your husband is a former Tory councilor. 
Already in May I described the task of the chairperson with a poisoned cup. 
Only the BBC does not stand as a gigantic and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also an internal paradox in his structure. 
The confidence works in two directions: towards inside onto the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, however also to the outside as a voice of public concern and noise if the things work wrongly. 
That guarantees for an almost untenable Duopol that demands after a complete comprehensive reform. 
But which again incoming chairperson would risk to line up, to hit everything and to take apart an institution which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty while even maybe he is depriving himself of his job in this case. 
It is a difficult task. 
And as if that were not already enough, also still many are at that interested - power, money and status overtakes. 
While the competition is coming closer and new technologies are threatening old, comfortable securities the pending negotiations of the royalties are joined with special dangers for the BBC. 
For the modest sum of 145.50 £ per annum the British public buys into the certainly largest media enterprise of the world. 
The BBC tells a good history she says that it reaches 96 percent of all budgets and costs only 40 pence to each of them per day. 
And apparently the BBC climbs on the popularity scale up again: 53 percent support her today, in comparison with 31 percent 10 years ago. 
The seeing and use habits for the BBC changed: I get nowadays information headlines on my mobile and see missed programs later on my iPlayer. 
But it remains a very loved and considerable institution. 
She needs a considerable chairperson - I hope, she found it
