Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me into the arm. 
Has said never "I love you" 
Henry was one thing of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958. 
His father that died when henry 19 was worked in a factory and their relation was restricted. 
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, the partial one is based on an imaginary conversation with his father and arose from the series on radio 4. 
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies. 
But henry had to plow through some difficult childhood moments. 
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father. 
It was heavy to know it 
One never saw his face, heard only his voice Stop with the crash. 
Leave your sister in peace. 
Move! 
I want to look cricket. 
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - that were already grown-up when I was a child - went with it into the pub and talked about things, as the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket stroke. 
I never had such a conversation with it 
A majority of my life it this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper was. 
Recently henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, nevertheless he gained an insight in how the life liked to have been for it 
It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, verraucht, deep stygische labyrinths with flame punches and smoke and a lot of soot. 
My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves. 
When I walked around there, I realized that he had done that for years in order to bring the food to the table, and my respect for it became greater. 
Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents. 
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you". 
Only when my mother was feeling bad by the end of their life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love" to say "you". 
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could split up the love which he had missed as a child. 
You could stop once with that "I love you"? 
Nevertheless stop embracing me! 
Daddy, I am 22! 
with Dawn French. 
Why should we not be friends? 
It is a splendid mother. 
It is gotten used still with French with which it was married 25 years. 
Dawn is a good human being. 
Why should we not be friends? 
It is a splendid mother. 
Henries' own mother was a diabetic. 
That contributed to their death. 
When I therefore very much, very became overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said "You must be radical. 
Therefore I pulled through this fitness thing and also a drastic diet had to do in order to reverse the symptoms. 
It is very heavy. 
And it is hard. 
Nobody eats carrots gladly. 
Maybe henries' career change is proved in his elegant, briefly cut beard. 
Since it was praised by the critics for his Othello, it is vereinnahmt from the theater. 
It The comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson followed. 
That is another experience than the Sitcoms and comedies which filled his busy working life. 
He began only with 16 years, when it worked in a factory. 
A DJ discovered it on the stage, than he imitated persons and wrote to New Faces about it 
His TV career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on televison for a quite long time." 
He learned in the profession. 
I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public, but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erz√§hl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult. 
Lenny 1975 with New Faces 
There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had, a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black henry performed his Comedy there more than five years. 
That was very unpleasant to my family. 
I wanted somehow that it would never have happened, however, I do not regret that I did it. 
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated in giant projects and learned how one deals with a large public. 
But this "prize-winning light column of the British watching television lasting for years was also a "grotesque parody of black people." 
Through the introduction of figures, that the British black culture both mocked as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative Comedykreis. 
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 on the air, and in the nineties it was among other things in the Comedyserie Chef as the chef de cuisine Gareth Blacklock! known. 
Advertising documentaries, TV-series and reels of film shaped his next decade, but according to his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought himself: "What you do as next, Len, because it feels so everything when you bring only the time for that or kick a little on the place." 
After that a documentary series came for radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...? 
The first consequence turned around Shakespeare. 
On Shakespeare I was downright allergic. 
I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class, whiteness, in tights and a cabbage in front in that. 
Therefore I had great fear of that. 
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once. 
Do not make it bad if you do not know which you talk about. 
Take a few of the words into the mouth, and then you will understand, why we all Shakespeare so dear. 
Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic. 
I had the feeling that I could create that. 
It was almost as if somebody would have put me on the head correctly at last 
"For that it works, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, investigates a little. 
The tests were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it. 
And it was a success. 
You splint a car accident expect, and that did simply not happen. 
And soon it occurred in the comedy of the errors. 
I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it. 
Over there there was a moment when I thought "Oh, you changed." 
There were a technical error and henry felt instinctively, that he must maintain the public. 
"A small voice said to me "You must bridge 10 minutes now, while they are repairing the computer." 
Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved. 
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God". 
I am not responsible for that. 
I can leave that to somebody else. 
You play in a play, therefore bleib in your role." 
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre 
To learn the text for Fences was pretentious. 
Panic is very good, that starches the tendons 
Also that arrived well, it is therefore as a big label of the gods, who say to me "That is here your definition 
He says this, natural with a THUNDERING voice 
Therefore I persevere. 
I really love that. 
I love to be in a test room 
Henry still has, however, the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while he is imitating persons again and again. 
I decided on not doing any Stand-up-Comedy because I think that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is somehow dangerous to full foreigner. 
If one searches that continuously, one goes in this way before a wall. 
I perform sometimes live in the Apollo if I fancy for this purpose, but in total it does not give to me so much as formerly. 
I ask him whether it will ever do a Stand-up-Comedytour again. 
The fun which I have in a room with a director which helps with shaping a beginning, a central part member and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever like to give that up again. 
Is that his new incarnation here therefore? 
I already think. 
I am gladly an actor. 
It does fun. 
One always tells a history and that is splendid. 
I love histories 
The people love histories
