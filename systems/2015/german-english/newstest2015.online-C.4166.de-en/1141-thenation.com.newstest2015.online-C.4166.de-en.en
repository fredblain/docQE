Moving-recollection of the very American ideal the industrial law as human rights 
The congress representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a law proposal in order to establish the organization of trade unions as some civil rights. 
"So as trade unions die, die also the middle class jobs", Ellison said, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the Progressive Caucus in the congress. 
Therefore I present proudly the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis. 
This epoch-making law gives workers the same legal possibilities in the case of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with the case of other forms of the discrimination - and stops strengths in a so antiunion-related way stopped. 
The supplement of the national industrial law law, around a possibility for exposed to a discrimination workers to the organization of a trade union representation to create, in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and in order to receive compensation or punishment money - a reasonable and necessary initiative is. 
But it is not a radical initiative with security - anyway not according to American standards. 
In fact the best kind and manner for the sense of what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back for a very American idea. 
In spite of the setbacks to whom the trade unions were misfired in the last years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states in the whole country - Americans encouraged once countries in all world to acknowledging stretching and stopping industrial law. 
There was a time which millions of Americans still remember, when this country mentioned democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the union right in a breath. 
When Japan filled the United States after the Second World War, general Douglas Mac Arthur and his stick encouraged the country to adopting a constitution which is supposed to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy. 
In full consciousness of that, that the workers and their trade unions during the creation of a new Japan took a role, they used a language that acknowledged explicitly that "the rights of the workers to union and common negotiating and action are guaranteed." 
When the United States fill after the Second World War Germany, general Dwight David Eisenhower and his stick pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would provide that that the fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy. 
In recognition of the fact, that the workers would have to organize, and should rise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a stipulation that testified explicitly: "The right to base unions around which Work and economical conditions to safeguard and to improve is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade. 
To curtail it agreements that restrict this right or are aimed at that are zero and vain; measures being aimed at that are unlawful. 
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship about the International Human Rights Commission from which the General declaration of the human rights was projected as it was taken over in 1948 of the United Nations as a worldwide agreement Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to the protection of his interests or to join them." 
Since generations Americans accept the basic premise, that industrial law human rights are. 
As this country other countries in this case advised as one can shape civilian and democratic societies Americans declared that the right to the foundation of a trade union must be protected - and on this trade union may participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent significant partner with enterprises and government places then. 
After these rights is turned out into America under bombardment it in fact very points, to make clear the American ideal again, accordingly the working population the must be right, to unite and hearing to be provided with in a free and open society 
How pastor Martin Luther King said Jr ones fifty years ago: 
A splendid instructor is the history 
Now they all know that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but extended it. 
Through the increase of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market in wondrous way for the industry and raised the entire nation to inconceivable production levels. 
Those ones who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the history preserves it 
The history remembers, and we should also do that. 
The formal recognition the industrial law as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination during the creation of employee representations - is for a long time overdue. 
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which made America big in the past and kept the promise of democracy.
