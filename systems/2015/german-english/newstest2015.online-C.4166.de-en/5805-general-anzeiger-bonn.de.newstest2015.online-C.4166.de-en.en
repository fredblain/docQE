New radome in Berkum: Wachtbergs landmark shrinks 
To that is not as expected so. 
Rather maintains the component being ready on being used in the prominent construction 
The action stands in the context of a greater measure: Almost 50 years after establishment of the space observation radar TIRA the wrapper, the so-called radome, is completely renewed. 
The new radome will be a little smaller with a diameter of 47.5 meters than the old one will. 
The size remains, however, still world record. 
The last step to the completion of the new wrapper is the cap exchange 
The upper quarter of the old wrapper is separated and lost with a crane. 
After that the last quarter of the new wrapper is put on. 
Provided that the weather is involved, the action at the beginning of this week is supposed to go over the stage.
