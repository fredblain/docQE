Richter stops law temporarily, that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing 
A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana, from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state, temporarily. 
This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice. 
The decision of the judge means, however, that the doctors keep on being able to carry on abortions legally temporarily while they are applying for such right. 
"The complainants can weiterarbeiten law-consistently while they" are "making" an effort for the attainment of these rights, wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment. 
Within a month a hearing is scheduled for the judge in order to cause a lasting decision for the law. 
Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights. 
"Meant "the present decision that the women escape" in Louisiana" "an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them", Nancy Northup, president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law, said. 
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it. 
Louisiana is to one of 11 states that enacted similar laws at which courts have declared recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution 
Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday. 
Abortion proponent and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say matchingly that installation rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors. 
Abortion opponents object that that the measures are used for the protection of the health of the women although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics. 
Only a doctor that carries out abortions in Louisiana, proceeded above Patienteineinweiserechte, informed of the center for reproduction rights. 
If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore, this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group. 
During their argumentation against the judgment representatives of the Louisiana state said that they would not punish any doctors because of the realization of abortions during whom requests for Patienteneinweiserechte would still be pendant.
