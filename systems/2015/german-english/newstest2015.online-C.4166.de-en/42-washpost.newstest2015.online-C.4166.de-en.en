Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington room increases with the economical recovery 
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs. 
It means also higher taxes. 
State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up, such an again published study in the last week, and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception. 
Enterprises in the room District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to state and local places in the finance year 2013, a rise, around 3.8 percent opposite the gains of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion $. 
The state and local tax burden of the enterprises went up in the last year about 4.3 percent onto 671 billion $, in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010. 
State taxes went up more strongly than the local deliveries about 4.3 percent, so the study, that of the service agency seriousness & Young with the center for State Taxation was carried on, a fiscal policy group. 
More than half of the tax yields of the District, 56 percent, comes from enterprise taxes while 36 percent of the gains Marylands are coming from enterprises. 
Virginia achieves the least tax yields with 28 percent from enterprises. 
A majority of the rise with the case of the tax yields is reasonable in a recovery of the real property values of the enterprises, say the researchers, which led to a rise of the real property taxes around 3.7 percent this year after the three successive years with growth rates from less than 1 percent. 
While a big part of these profits was coming from big states as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to apply also to the Washington room 
Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid together more than 10 billion $ at state and local real property taxes in the last year, in comparison with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise during a year around 4.2 percent. 
But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here. 
Enterprise in Virginia and D.C. almost half of their state and local taxes pay in the form of real property taxes. 
"In Maryland following happens: a big part of the real properties, in particular in the tax field around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that" do not "pay" any real property taxes, said Douglas to Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation. 
Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer. 
The recent recovery with the case of the tax yields through enterprises cannot be assigned only to the recovery of the property market 
Seem also to recover to enterprise gains, so the data. 
Enterprises in the region reported about income taxes with the case of state organizations of 2.3 billion $ in comparison with 2.1 billion in the year 2012. 
Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes, the highest amount of the region 
While the trend is going into the same direction, the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly 
The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average with 4.3 percent while the rise was being clearly higher in Maryland, 4.9 percent. 
Only Virginia announced a lower-average tax amount of 4.1 percent. 
Virginia has the clearly least enterprise income taxes (in all three there are fixed enterprise tax rates) with 6 percent in all three areas of competence. 
The enterprise tax rate in Maryland is enclosed at 8.25 percent and in the District relatively high 9.975 percent. 
A comparable study of the US chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed, that in Virginia smaller state and local enterprise taxes are demanded and there is in total a better tax climate than in Maryland. 
In the study the District was not examined. 
In spite of the advantages Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbor. 
North Carolina passed laws for the lowering of his enterprise tax rates this year of 6.9 percent on 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will sink in the coming year onto 5 percent. 
If the state keeps on reaching his income objectives in the coming year, this law could reduce the enterprise income tax sentence of the state to 2017 apart from 3 percent. 
Going in the meantime seems better to the small firms in the Washington room and they pay therefore more state and local taxes, so the recent study. 
Enterprise taxes that are paid as personal income taxes through small businessmen - a temporary structure according to which most small enterprises are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia went up in the last year about 20 percent on 2.4 billion $, a clear faster growth rate as the enterprise taxes in total. 
The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year. 
Nevertheless the Washington room could hinterherhinken if the edition shortening of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region
