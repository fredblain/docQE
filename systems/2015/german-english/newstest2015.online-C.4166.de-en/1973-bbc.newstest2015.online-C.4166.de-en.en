Production in the euro zone on a 13-month-depression 
The rise during the production in the euro zone slowed itself down in August onto the lowest point of the last 13 months, such an exactly observed study with. 
The final Markit Einkaufsmanagerindex of the producing trade (PMI) fell in August on 50.7 in, to a state of 51.8 in in July. 
A specification over 50 indicates an expansion. 
New tasks went back and factories experienced burglaries of tensions increasing in a time between the EU and Russia about Ukraine. 
The numbers occur before the meeting of the European central bank (EZB) on Thursday. 
The markets expect a clear plan from the bank only of 0.3% for the contact with a hesitating recovery of the euro zone as well as deflation threatening for that one with the case of an inflation rate. 
It gives to speculations to the conductor of the EZB, Mario Draghi, being able to give further information during this week whether it takes a quantitative relief into account for the euro zone according to that one which were carried out by Great Britain and the USA during the financial crisis. 
"Although a small growth is better than no growth at all, the effects of the increasing economical and geopolitical insecurities for the manufacturers slowing down became clearer", said Rob Dobson, leading economist, at Markit. 
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, the tallest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell onto the deepest state in 11 months with 51.4. 
In the meantime the PMI fell on 46.9 in the second-largest economic nation of the block, France. 
France remains a worry child, as also the descent of Italy from a sound expansion to the stagnation. 
Tips on growth stimuli not gripping in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands anymore are also not calming", said Mr Dobson. 
The drop of the industry stirs up presumably the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiskale stimuli. 
A positive information came from the republic of Ireland, where the PMI went up on 57.3, the highest level since end 1999. 
Howard Archer, chief economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that one can say for the purchase manager index of the producing trade in the euro zone of August is that after that the sector keeps on increasing." 
He added: "Producers in the euro zone find the life quite difficult currently obviously, there the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially with respect to Russia and Ukraine - insecurities into that one furthermore difficult conditions in many countries increase. 
These increased insecurities influenced the economy very clear - in particular, and the confidence of the consumers, and results presumably in some tasks delaying or even being canceled in particular major tasks. 
He said that it becomes "increasingly more probable" that finally the EZB must introduce a kind of the QE "although we presume that this will be restricted."
