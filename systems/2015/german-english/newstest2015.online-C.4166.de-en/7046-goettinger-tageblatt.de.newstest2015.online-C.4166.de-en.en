When some years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted for the purpose of tensioning of the league-division, that was a step into the correct direction. 
Now the German Table Tennis Federal Government took an additional 3rd Federal League into the program. 
The consequence: Who did not climb up descended. 
So Göttingens class-highest team torpedo avoided indeed the descent in the Second League Relegation, plays in the coming season, however, only still fifth class. 
Fourth-Class ladies have torpedoes, in spite of their overwhelming passage into the regional league. 
The boys and girls of torpedo start in the Lower Saxony league, in the same way as the boys of the SC Weende. 
Upon the SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserve enter in the new association league, in the country league no Göttinger clubs are more represented. 
With the ladies the TTV Geismar in the association league, the torpedo-second in the country league, plays. 
What of the composition looks like a better district class is now the new district Second League south. 
Here Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC of Weser and the TTC at, step torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, to TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen. 
In the district league Dransfeld and the SC Weende allude as regional representatives, in which district class of the TTC II, red white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district Second League of the ladies begins at least in establishment. 
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with of the lot. 
In the district league start torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen run. 
With each nine teams 
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league. 
Also the district league relay of the SCW-boys - there torpedo II still sets off - is not complete. 
In a district class Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season. 
The two Göttinger circular leagues with each nine teams compete in the first season of the again based region association 
In the west-relay torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II, are the red-white II, Bovender SV III, lukewarm creek II. 
In the east-relay Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Santa Claus mountain and Landolfshausen play among other things. 
The lady circular league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume. 
That is still better than in the circle Osterode, where there are not any lady-teams anymore at all on circular level. 
Becoming noticeable, that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen reaches establishment, here the innovative and umtriebige circular executive board will have to be concerned already once.
