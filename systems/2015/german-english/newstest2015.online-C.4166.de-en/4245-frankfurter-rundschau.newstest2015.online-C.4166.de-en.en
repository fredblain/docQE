German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin town Guangzhou - so the urgent wish of the official ones in China says. 
"We would be very pleased if a German brewing sat down in our city", said the vice-Parteisekretär of the south-Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, in this week during the visit of a SPD-delegation in his city.

Therefore the people would have also the purchasing power, to be able to afford German beer. 
The Hessian SPD-chairperson Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel who led the German politician delegation accepted to the host, he will hear himself in Germany after a possible partner for the project.

More businesses

The Lufthansa had offered the flight formerly, but had deleted it in the year 2012 from economical reasons. 
"It would be worthwhile again", the local politician showed convinces. 
"The businesses between our two cities take always further too". 
Currently travellers would have to take the detour over Changsha in the province Hunan, Li complained. 
Also the administration of the province Guangdong whose capital is Guangzhou hopes for the air connections 
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish into the foreground at his conversation with the social democrats. 
"That is a very good idea", Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese Vizeminister Li Jinjun, an intimate expert of Germany, nodded in agreement. 
Well-kept partnership 
The affable vice-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes for his being able to go to Frankfurt in the next year for a partnership meeting.
