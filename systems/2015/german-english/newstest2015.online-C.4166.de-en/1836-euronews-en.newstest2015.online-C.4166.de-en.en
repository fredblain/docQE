Not all children in Ukraine return to the school 
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1. September) after the summer vacations. 
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents prime minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter into the school. 
There it informed waiting journalists that all schools had not opened again, that it however, is decided to defend the country for future generations: 
The September celebrations were not kept off in every school. 
The sky is not peaceful everywhere above Ukraine. 
We must fight for a peaceful sky 
The entire Ukraine, a gigantic common Ukrainian popular front must fight for a peaceful sky 
Visited Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slawjansk, the Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian. 
We hope for there being peace here at last again and the children receiving an education which will be useful to them in the further life. 
The first school day of the new school year at which the children wear embroidered shirts, hold them for balloons in the hands and give them to their teachers flowers is celebrated traditionally.
