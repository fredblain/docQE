Stick sergeant a. D. Berni Diether works as a pyrotechnician since the closing of the former military training area 
For just ten years people do not fire on the former military training area into Münsingen anymore. 
In spite of that Swabian emerges still every month of fatal ammunition in the heart of the biosphere field nightmare 
The shells are sometimes still so dangerous that they must be exploded on site. 
A deafening bang echoes with the case of the burstings above the heart of the biosphere field. 
In December 2004 the last sharp shot fell on the military training area Münsingen, the at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military company was closed. 
Since this time the 6500 hectares big area is the main item of the biosphere field Swabian nightmare that is opened on 13 shown ways for hikers and cyclists.
