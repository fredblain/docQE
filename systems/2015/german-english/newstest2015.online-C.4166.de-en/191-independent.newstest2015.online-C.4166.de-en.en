Exclusive departure from new novel highly vowed to Howard Jacobsons about love and the letter "J". 
Run you, one could describe it best so, they dispersed slowly as a cardboard which one has in the rain leave. 
Sometimes a woman told to him, it is too serious, hard, intense distanziert and maybe a little snappish. 
And the hand shook to him then. 
Snappishly he knew. 
It was prickly, as in hedgehogs, yes. 
The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was a just beginning affair which had been more promising for a relief of the secluded boredom of his life than else, and maybe would have brought him even a certain contentment. 
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with uncurbed hairs and a fluttering heart from a village on the north island which was even even remoter and rougher than port Reuben. 
It had come to south with an older company that held Kevern for their aunt, and that had inherited a plot in a moist but paradisiac valley with the apt name Paradise Valley. 
Over several years nobody had lived in the house. 
The tubes were leaky, in the baths spiders were still, slugs had left behind their tracks on all windows and believed, that all belongs to them, and the garden was with weed practiced grown-up, that looked like gigantic cabbages. 
It was a garden of full secrets as the house from a child fairy tale, both alarming and enticing. 
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the Longlist for that one stands One Booker price 2014. 
The short cunning is announced in the coming week. 
Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had latched themselves absentmindedly into the service console that supplied the country with calming music and calming news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a for a long time forgotten black entertainer which his father had listened to gladly near closed rolling shutters in the house. 
Your feet are too large. 
Due to their ureigenen aggressivity songs of this kind were not played anymore on the console. 
Not forbidden - nothingness was so correctly prohibited - not played simply. 
It became successfully obsolesziert, so as the word obsoleszieren. 
The general taste created, what decrees and rules would never have created, and choose the Vom plate scrubber zum-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and love novels as the people at books, so they chose with the case of the music the ballads. 
In the euphoria of the day began to play Kevern an imaginary piano and to record on large feet in a coarse-funny serenade Ailinns. 
Ailinn did not understand that. 
"That was a known song of a jazz pianist by the name of Fats Waller", it declared her and laid automatically two fingers onto his lips. 
His father had always done that in order to stop the letter J before his coming from his mouth. 
It had begun as a game between it and his father when it was still small. 
His father had played it with his own father, so it had told. 
If you begin a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny. 
It had not been already a very merry game then, and it was not also now very merry. 
He knew, which this was expected by him, that was everything. 
It had to be declared what jazz was. 
To which ones Ailinn had never yet belonged. 
Jazz was not played even if it was not directly forbidden. 
The improvising was not more modern. 
It was only place for an only "when" in the life. 
The people wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody, where it would end. 
In the same way the intelligence. 
His Unvorhersehbarkeit made the people nervous. 
And jazz was musically expressed intelligence. 
Although he had become 10 years old without having heard about Sammy Davis junior, knew Kevern a little about jazz of that one half secret collection old CDs' of his father. 
However, at least it did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black. 
In their age she could not remember presumably a time in which pop singers were not black. 
Again was valid, no laws or compulsions 
A consistent society meant, that every element of this society agreed thankful the principle of the group talent - thankfully as the ones spared to from the fate. 
People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable through temperament and build for conversation and sport, therefore they sang and they ran. 
People who came from the Indian subcontinent initially were blessed as of the nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of guaranteeing that no family without functioning engineer's order wire unit telephone stayed. 
What was still remaining from the Polish community cared around the canalization; what was remaining from the Greeks smashed plates. 
Those ones from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD HAPPENED, IF IT HAD HAPPENED happen- for fear, to be accused of fire poke, for fear even, that they would consume the flames as next - had held Labneh- and revealed to Shisha whistle restaurants,themselves considers and became with the idleness depressive. 
Everyone according to his abilities 
Since she had heard only ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words could ever be vertont that had just vorgesungen her Kevern. 
Music was expression of love. 
"Those ones are not really offensive", said to Kevern. 
Except for maybe for people whose feet are too large. 
My father has never offended somebody, but he loved this song. 
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the treacherous feeling of security 
The sound absorption of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves could not overcome anything. 
Ailinn did still not understand. 
Why your father should have loved something like that? 
He wanted to say that it was a joke, hesitated, however, with laying two fingers again onto the lips in their present 
She thought anyhow already that it was a little strange. 
"It appeared merry to him", he said instead of this. 
It joggled unbelievingly their head and obstructed Keverns view 
It did not admit anything else on the whole world see, as their uncombed raven hair. 
There was not Anything which otherwise he would have wanted to see. 
"If you say it", she thinks without conviction. 
But that does not declare why you vorsingst it to me yet. 
It seemed honestly worried. 
Are my feet too large? 
He looked once again there. 
Your feet so directly not. 
Maybe your ankles a little bit... 
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick? 
Hate you? 
Of course I do not hate you. 
Nevertheless that is only the stupid song. 
It could have said "I love you", but for that it was still too early. 
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you", he attempted it instead of this. 
I am a little perverted there. 
That did not ring correctly. 
It had been supposed to be funny. 
If he attempted to be funny, he often in trouble killed himself, because it did not have as his father the calming Charm that one needed in order to control the cruelty inherent in jokes. 
Maybe his father wanted to be also cruel. 
Maybe he of Kevern wanted, that be. 
In spite of his friendly eyes. 
Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their beach chair, overturned the console and spilled the wine which they had drunk. 
Elder flower wine, therefore drunkenness was not an excuse for it 
In their excitement it seemed to tremble, as palm fronds in the storm 
"And your stubborn person is exactly the reason why I feel perverted drawn to you", it said... 
Except for, that I am not that at all. 
He was sorry about it both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words as also the fear that was proved in their eyes when she revolted against it 
Did she think that he would beat it 
It had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he did not have any doubts that it was like this basically as here. 
The same gigantic and icy-cold ocean broke to itself here as there at the shore 
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more peevish after THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, drew from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman, who refused them or verlachte. 
Stubborn person? 
Those ones would have shown her a thick fist if she did not look out! 
You first smooch - Smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote for the meaningless love ballads from the console - with her first smooch and beat then. 
According to Keverns opinion that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching represented even already an act of the power 
Ailinn Solomons admitted a sign to him through their body go. 
It rose from the beach chair as an old man. 
She felt also leaden, but the impact of his grief surprised her. 
That was not the end of the world. 
Nevertheless you hardly knew yourself. 
She watched to him, as he left - so as from a room in the upper stick their companion watched him during that - a man, burdened by something that he himself had caused. 
Adam leaves the garden, she thought. 
She felt a sudden pain for it and men in general, although some their hands against them had risen. 
A man turned away from it bent his back, abashed, conquer, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that it seemed good to know, when they could remember nevertheless not onto an only time, at which she had seen something like that before the present day already once? 
When it was again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet. 
Many years in front of the just told incidents Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher worked on a short lecture on the consecutive power in the task of Ofnow, the nonlegislative monitoring control for the public atmosphere, on low and middle level in exactly the regions, in which to expect their decrease, if not abolition, at the ehesten are been, in view of the money and energy that the extermination of this power had been invested in. 
"It was done already a lot, and a lot must still be done", she wrote "in order to soothe the innate aggressivity of a nation that led a thousand wars and won most of them in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was verspürt seen historical in spite of the church towers rising highly between the rears rarely. 
But some properties turn out as ineradicable. 
The higher the church tower, it seems like this, the passion in a the smaller way that it keeps on waking. 
The population cries during the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicates with histories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family lives firmly, however, nevertheless only the former brutality does not hold the rural municipalities just the same as our urban structures do in the hand, but there are also proofs for the origin of a new and insidious belligerence at home, at the job, on the streets and even on the grounds. 
"You have an unhappy tendency towards the exaggeration", thought their mentor when he had read the whole report. 
I suggest that you read less novels. 
Esme Nussbaum bowed their head. 
I must also ask: are you an atheist? 
"I believe, I do not have "to say" that, Esme Nussbaum answered. 
Are you lesbian? 
Again Esme referred onto their right to privacy and refusal of the statement 
Feminist? 
Again silence. 
"I do not ask that," finally Luther Rabinowitz said "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism. 
That here an unprejudiced job is. 
An unprejudiced society uses us. 
However, specific kinds of hypersensitivity that are completely acceptable and praiseworthy at themselves can distort on the occasion of results as you introduced it 
You yourself have prejudices obviously against the church, and these things which you refer to as "insidious" and "raw" strength and vitality could be interpreted by others just as well than expression of one of course. 
When one rides out wider on the, WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAS HAPPENED as if it would have happened yesterday if it had happened means, to take his essential vitality the country. 
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking. 
Repeated behind his head a LED lettering in flamingo pink the advice, that Ofnow the country in the last quarter century or longer had given. 
You smile at their neighbor, wertschätzen you you visit their partner, you hear ballads, musicals, you use their telephone, speak you hear, you declare, you excusing too, you vote too, you. 
Speaking is better than silence is, the sung word is better than the written one is, but nothing is better than love is. 
"I completely understand on what you want out", Esme Nussbaum with quiet voice answered, als sie secure was, that their superior to end had spoken, "and I do not say anything else than that we did not cure as effectively as we show ourselves ourselves yet. 
My concern lies in our recovering ourselves possibly without prior warning at how we repeat the errors that anyway first to THAT WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAS HAPPENED led. 
This time the others at whom we skip our rage and our distrust are not it, however. 
Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands. 
Around in this way a patience of Job point out. 
"You go too far", he said "if you refer to actions" as "errors which our grandparents maybe or neither committed". 
You go also too far if you speak of that that these their "rage" and their "Distrusting" at "others" would have let out. 
It should not be actually necessary, somebody in your position at that remember, that we with the case of the sense of the past as with the case of the protection of the present not speak of "us" and "others". 
There was no "we" and there were not any "else". 
It was a time of the disorder that is all which we know. 
"Of that one if we are honest to ourselves ourselves" dared to throw in Esme, "to have behaved well, "no part of the society can claim. 
I do not accuse anybody. 
Whether it badly or well what happened was done is happen. 
That was then. 
More does not have to be said with regard to that anything - there we agree agreed to ourselves. 
And exactly as no fault has to be assigned, so also no fault has to be paid off if such deletion would be appropriate and if it would give a way to wipe it out. 
But for what the past is used if we do not learn from that - 
The past is used for our forgetting it 
If I may say something with regard to that - 
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid tumble down. 
"I will consider their report", he said and released her. 
On the next day, when it went as usual to the work it was run over by a motorcyclist who had gone onto the footpath, described as passers-by, in a kind of "brutal rage". 
There are coincidences.
