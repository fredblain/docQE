Do the castle associations pull soon at a rope again? 
Last there was again and again quarrel between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations. 
Now the executive boards think about a possible cooperation. 
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the late Richard Dimbath, former chairperson of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, mentioned the project in the French Guédelon. 
A year ago yet no good climate existed between the castle association and the castle friends wolf council beluga. 
The points of view seemed distinctly different up to now as the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction are supposed to be dealt with. 
Now the two warehouses on each other move too: Conversations are supposed to be led already soon about a common procedure. 
The association executive boards confirm to Torsten Sjöberg (Castle association) and to Herbert Piffl (Castle friends) on demand of our newspaper that. 
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together once", tells Sjöberg. 
According to his opinion all members of both associations could pull in the future again at a rope. 
So more quickly visible successes are to be noted. 
While the castle friends were having a reconstruction of the castle around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath till the end at the mountain wood in mind, stands for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the ground at most front place. 
Herbert Piffl, Second chairperson of the castle friends, was very pleased with the call according to own information 
Since Dimbaths death he presides over the castle friends. 
A new chairperson is supposed to be found in the middle of September in a general meeting. 
Currently the association counts according to the 74-year long one about 40 members. 
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we made the association activities out of respect rest first of all". This "thinking-phase" was necessary in order to "consider how it could go on". 
According to Piffl the new chairperson is supposed to go then into the conversation with the castle association. 
Until then the castle friends could make themselves also a current atmosphere picture within their grouping. 
There is currently yet not a candidate for the chairmanship, says Piffl. 
"But I am confident, that somebody will find himself He himself does not want to present himself because he has his residence in bath Tölz. 
The new chairperson should be a Wolfratshauser. 
The Tölzer keeps on wanting "to cooperate" in the project "however very gladly. 
The different points of view as regards reconstruction will presumably consist in the eyes Piffls in next time stay. 
He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle. 
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream. 
Through a high participation of the population as well as through voluntary helpers from all world it is a tourist magnet. 
Piffl: "Also I was at the beginning sceptical. 
However, with time I was convinced more and more that it is reasonable to drive forward the project". An "alone position feature" can be created for the raftsman city. 
Here there is not really otherwise anything. 
Furthermore the project would be financeable through EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes. 
"I personally do not want to fling the idea of the reconstruction simply overboard therefore". He hopes for the castle association moving in this point maybe a little. 
Their aim of documenting the history first of all "is important and good". 
After that one could see.
