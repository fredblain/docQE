In a comment onto the New Press it contradicts statements of the manager Peer Medau and certifies this to pose "as a commander". 
The style of the college is not this, it is said in the communication 
So the family Medau is already "verbal" To "Middle June about the unreasonable request of the college informed. 
The statement that the plans became known only in July, are definitively wrong so Pötzl.
