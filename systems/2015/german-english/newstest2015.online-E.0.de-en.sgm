<seg id="1">Return to the very American ideally the labor laws as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The congresswomen Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a legal proposal in order to establish the organization of labor unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">Die "so like labor unions, die also the middle class jobs," said Ellison, a democrat out of Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the progressive Caucus in the congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore I introduce proudly jointly the colleague authorization law with the civil right icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This pioneering law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of labor unions such as in other forms of the discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich adjusted powers.</seg>
<seg id="6">The supplement of the national labor law law in order to create a possibility for a discrimination exposed workers to the organization of a labor union representation, to complain around before a civil court around justice - and around compensation or fine to received - a meaningful and necessary initiative is.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is with security no radical initiative - in any case not after American standard.</seg>
<seg id="8">The best type and manner to the understanding is actual its, what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill propose, the connection back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">In spite of the setbacks, which the labor unions in the past years stopped were - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries in the entire country - have American once countries in the world in addition encourages to acknowledge, to expand and to keep labor law.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, at which millions of Americans yet remember, when this country named democracy, speech freedom, press freedom and the union right in a breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the second world war, encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its rod the country in addition to dismiss a constitution, that should guarantee, that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full consciousness its that the workers and its labor unions took in in the creation of a new Japan a roll, used it a language that explicitly acknowledged, that "the rights of the workers are" on union and joint negotiating and actions guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupy after the second world war Germany, Dwight David Eisenhower pressed general and be rod the Germans to write a constitution, that would provide, that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves, and should raise its voice in the new nation, inserted the Germans a clause, that explicitly stated: "The right to establish unions, in order to secure and to improve the works and economic conditions is guaranteed every single and every occupation or business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements, that restrict this right or aim on that, to lessen it are are null and void; on that aiming measures illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the earlier First lady Eleanor Roosevelt possessed the chair over the international human right commission, of which the general explanation of the human rights was sketched, how she was received 1948 by the United Nations than a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "every is right the to form labor unions to the protection of its interests or to join" them.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since generations, Americans accept the reason premise that labor laws of human right are.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised other countries at the same time, how one could form civil and democratic societies, declared American that the right would have to be protected on the foundation of a labor union - and on that, that this labor union then at collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with business and government places participate might -.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights in America under gunfire ridden is it actually very would show to bring to the attention of itself the American ideally again, consequently the working population the right have must to unite itself and to get in a free and open company ear.</seg>
<seg id="20">How pastor Martin Luther King Jr. fifty years ago said:</seg>
<seg id="21">The story is a magnificent teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the worker movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but rather enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Through the raising of the standard of living of millions people work created in wonderful manner a market for the industry and raised the entire nation on unimaginable production levels.</seg>
<seg id="24">That that attack the work forget these simple truths, but the story preserves it.</seg>
<seg id="25">The story remembers, and we should do that also.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of the labor laws as human rights - and the expansion of the protection of the civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representations - is a long time overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideal that largely made America in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="9">It was not directly clearly whether the judgment extended also on the physicians out of the two clinics, that had not joined the complaint and had applied for also introduction rights.</seg>

<seg id="12">Abortion advocate and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say concurring that introduction rights demand restrictions unnecessary by physicians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents hold that toward that the measures serve the protection of the health of the women, although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a physician, who in Louisiana abortion carries out, controlled patient one manner rights, divided the center for reproduction rights with.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all remaining physicians in the country are forced in addition, to carry out no more abortion, this physician would carry out the operation out of anxiety around its security no longer, said the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">In its argumentation against the judgment, representatives of the country Louisiana said that it no physicians would punish because of the execution of abortion, while its proposals would be yet pending on Patienteneinweiserechte.</seg>

<seg id="5">Henry rehearses it for a comedy, Rudy's scarce Records that is based partially upon an imaginary conversation with its father and developed from the series on radios 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Soundtrack is a mixture out of Reggae and Rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work itself through some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">It visited "many" therapies after death of its mother, and Henry is reflective over its relation to its father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was heavy to know it.</seg>
<seg id="10">One never saw its face, heard only its voice: "Stop with the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let your sister in quiet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move you!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want cracked view.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - that were already adult, when I a child was - went with it into the tavern and spoke over things, like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with it.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was a large part of my life this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than an at times its father, he won yet an insight therein how life might have been for it.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark, waft away, deep stygische mazes with flame pushes and smoke and much soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father put himself earlier simply into the tub and then one slowly was able to hear it how he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry of itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I ran around there, became clearly that it had done that for years in order to bring the meal on the table, and my attention before it became larger to me.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without Liebesbezeugungen of its parents.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he never said "I dear you".</seg>
<seg id="23">First as it of my mother toward the end of its life badly went to say caught we on, "I dear you, I dear you, I dear you".</seg>
<seg id="24">Through its own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, was able to divide it the love, that it had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop once "I with that dear yourself"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Stop yet embracing me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Papa, I am 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">It is a magnificent mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is married was still with French friendly, with that it 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a magnificent mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Mother own Henrys was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to its death.</seg>
<seg id="37">As I therefore very, very overweight became and showed symptoms of diabetes, said must be radical my physician "you.</seg>
<seg id="38">Therefore I got through this fitness thing and had to make also a drastic diet in order to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very heavy.</seg>

<seg id="41">No one eats gladly carrot.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henrys career change appears perhaps in its elegant, shingled beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by the critics for its Othello, he is collects of the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">It followed the comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">That is be filled out have another experience as the Sitcoms and comedies, that busy work life.</seg>
<seg id="46">It began with only 16 years when it worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered it on the stage when it wrote people imitated and to New Faces over it.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its TV career began middle of the seventies. "I was for a rather long time the single black imitator/Comedian on television".</seg>
<seg id="49">It learned in the occupation.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to become not only before the eyes of the public large, but rather also of 1975 to 1985, that learn how I was able to become an efficient joke-Erzähl-machine, while I was through television a star, and was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 in New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">And White Minstrel show looked possessed there its manager the stage rights at that, an easy support program, in that itself the people "blackly painted", led Henry its Comedy there over five years up.</seg>
<seg id="53">That was my family very unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="54">I wished somehow that it never would have happened, but I do not regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated on giant projects and learned how one handles a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this "years-long prize-winning easy column of the British distance marriage" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".</seg>
<seg id="57">Through the introduction of figures, that the British black culture both mocked celebrated how, worked Henry in the eighties at an alternative Comedykreis.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first row of the Lenny Henry show went 1984 on shipment, and in the ninetieses, it was among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedyserie boss! well known.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentary, series of TV and film rolls stamped its next decade, but after its series of BBC LennyHenry. tv 2008, he thought himself: "What you make next, Len because it feels all so, as bring you only the time around or trittst a few on the place".</seg>
<seg id="60">After that a Dokumentarserie came for radios 4 with the title What's it so Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first consequence revolved around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">On Shakespeare, I was regular allergic.</seg>
<seg id="63">I never had learned something in the school correctly over it and considered it predominantly to be a domain of the middle class, white in stocking pairs of pants and a cabbage head ahead inside.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore I had large anxiety before that.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everyone that we interviewed for the show Peter hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, judos Dench said should try "you it once.</seg>
<seg id="66">Do not make it badly if you do not know, whereby you speak.</seg>
<seg id="67">Nimm a couple of the words into the mouth, and then you will understand why we love all Shakespeare so.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry itemized 20 lines out of Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthused.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I was able to create that.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost, as would have someone the head finally correctly mounted me.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Therefore goes it, it is a serious thing, nimm it seriously, learn your text, would research a little.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and that did not happen simply.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon it appeared in the comedy of the errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was was hardly able to believe in the national theater and I it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There there was a moment when I thought, "oh, you have you changes"."</seg>
<seg id="78">There were felt a technical mistake and Henry instinctively that it had to maintain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A small voice said must bridge you now 10 minutes to me", repair while it the computer"."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead the stage leader announced that the presentation would go on, as soon as the problem would be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went said of the stage and anything in me "oh, God would be thanks to".</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not for that responsible.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave that someone to other.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a theater piece, therefore shelter in your role".</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">To learn the text for Fences was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">Also that arrived well, it is say is therefore like a large sign of the Gods, that "that here your determination"." to me.</seg>
<seg id="89">It says this, naturally, with a THUNDERING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">Therefore I remain at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="91">I love that really.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love it to be in a sample room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry has however still the head of a Comedian - our conversation is gotten through of humorous outbreaks while it imitates again and again people.</seg>
<seg id="94">I concluded to make no state-up-Comedy because I find, that this type of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is dangerous more fully more strangely somehow.</seg>
<seg id="95">If one seeks that continually, one goes therewith before a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I appear sometimes live in the Apollo if I am in the mood in addition, but altogether it does not give me so much like earlier.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask it whether it will make ever again a state-up-Comedytour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joke, that I have in a room with a director, that helps at the same time, a beginning to form a means part and the end of a trip - I do not believe that I would like to abandon that ever again.</seg>
<seg id="99">Is that here therefore its new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think already.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am gladly an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It is fun.</seg>

<seg id="9">A year after that the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>

<seg id="11">After some months in a warehouse, it went 1946 to Bavaria - in the goods car.</seg>
<seg id="12">So verschlug it judge into the upper Franconian depression village.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher development took place in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition Manfred judge had to run six times ten kilometers to the next railway station per week, had to go with which train go to Bamberg, there three kilometers diagonally through the entire city to the school and evenings back.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, Manfred judge in a red-cross-home in Bamberg got a sleep opportunity: together with up to 15 fellow pupils in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">It made 1951 the first and 1954 after three years scholar office applicant the second country examination.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because Upper Franconia had no free scholar generation for it, he applied himself to Upper Bavaria and came on the 1st of November 1954 at the school in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Miss room" was its first "service dwelling" in the school house.</seg>
<seg id="19">It related 1958 in the new built teacher house next to the school a three-room-service dwelling.</seg>

<seg id="29">"One two kinds must give the children: Be rooted and wing", says that today 84-Jährige.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it had to learn: "That does not succeed always". Whether it means there only its student or just as its own six children, is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In every case, doing was judge sometimes unorthodox.</seg>
<seg id="32">If students thrashed himself, they got a punishment work of it not and were condemned also not for detention.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of community couple of box gloves had get let judges two and let begin both contractor against each other, also if there should be at the same time once a violet.</seg>

<seg id="4">Your career began in the worldwide management consultation business Bain and Co. whereon it changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the medium world of Pearsons.</seg>
<seg id="5">You chairman of the board of the Financial Times was for seven years and resigned when the uppermost post of the mother business Pearsons went at a younger masculine colleague.</seg>

<seg id="7">Also its political Ranking is solid.</seg>
<seg id="8">It became sought became David Cameron of lord Browne that recommended earlier chairperson of BP, than this after more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: it the adviser of the cabinet.</seg>

<seg id="10">Already in May I described the task of the chairpeople with a poisoned cup.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only the BBC stands as a gigantic and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but rather there is also an internal paradoxically in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The confidence functions in two directions: after interior on the first corps of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outward as a voice of public apprehension and unrest if the things incorrectly run.</seg>
<seg id="13">That provides for a duo pole almost untenable, that demands after a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>

<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as that would be not already enough, are interested also yet many on that to see the BBC reduced - power, money and status overtakes.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition more closely moves and new technologies threaten old, comfortable securities, the standing negotiation of the license fees is connected for the BBC with special dangers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of 145.50£per year the British public shops itself into the certainly largest medium business of the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and everyone costs therefrom only 40 Pence per day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently the BBC climbs on the popularity scale again towards the top: 53 percent support it today, in comparison with 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>

<seg id="30">It had to explain, what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had heard never which.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz became, also if it was not forbidden directly, not played.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvising was no longer modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was only place for an only "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">The people wanted to be certain entire at the beginning of a melody where it would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just as the intellect.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictable-ness made the people nervously.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically expressed intellect.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although it had become 10 years old, without having heard of Sammy Davis junior, knew Kevern something over jazz of the half secret collection of old CDS of its father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least it didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats ramparts was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">In its age, she was not able to remember probably a time, in which pop singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again counted, no laws or compulsions.</seg>
<seg id="43">An in conformity company meant that each element of this company agreed gratefully with to the principle of the group aptitude - gratefully like that of the fate of spared.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with afro Caribbean origin were suited through temperament and physique for support and sport, therefore they sang and raced.</seg>
<seg id="45">People, who came originally of the Indian subcontinent, were like of nature with electronic talent blessed and were looked after with the task, to guarantee that no family remained without functioning service telephone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was remaining yet of the Polish partnership, attended to the sewer system; what was remaining of the Greeks, plate smashed.</seg>
<seg id="47">That out of the gulf countries and the Levante, whose grandparents the country quickly left had not as WHAT EVENTS WAS IF IT happened WAS out of fear TO EVENTS to be accused because of Feuerschürens, out of fear even that the flames would consume it next - had Labneh- and Shisha-pipes-restaurants opened, held considers itself and became with the inactivity depressive.</seg>
<seg id="48">Every after its capacities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because it had belonged to only ballad, it fell Ailinn heavily, to understand, become could like the insulting words, that just had sung before Kevern its, per vertont.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"That are not really insulting," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people, whose feet are too large.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">It spoke too much, but that neglected gave garden it the deceitful feeling of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Was nothing able to overcome the sound insulation of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn did not understand still.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have should so something dear?</seg>
<seg id="58">It wanted to say that it was a joke, hesitated however to put in its present again two fingers at the lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">It thought anyway already that it was somewhat strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"Appear amusingly to it," said it instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">It shook unbelieving its head and blocked Keverns visibility.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was in the entire world nothing other to see when its ungekämmtes crow black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing what it would have wanted to see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say it," mine it without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not explain yet why you sing before me it.</seg>
<seg id="66">They seemed honestly concerned.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too large?</seg>
<seg id="68">It looked once again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so directly not.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps your knuckles, a small little...</seg>
<seg id="71">Do and you say hates me, you because my knuckles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Do you hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Naturally I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is yet only the stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">It would have been able to say "I dear you", but for that it was yet too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick knuckles are exactly the reason why you please me," tried it it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am there a little perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That did not sound correctly.</seg>
<seg id="79">It had strangely be should.</seg>
<seg id="80">If he tried to be strange, he brought himself often in difficulties because he did not control like its father the calming Charm, that one needed, around the cruelty inherent in jokes to bezähmen.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps wanted to be be also cruel father.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps it wanted to be, Kevern, that.</seg>
<seg id="83">In spite of its friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons became red and rose out of its deck chair, threw the console over and spilled the wine that they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elder blossom wine, therefore drunkenness was no apology for it.</seg>
<seg id="86">In its excitement, they seemed to tremble, like Palm frond in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your stubbornness is exactly the reason why I feel moved perverse to you," said it...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except, that I am that not at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">It harmed it, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of its words such as the fear, that appeared in its eyes, when she resisted herself against it.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did it think that it would strike it?</seg>
<seg id="91">It had not told it of life on the cold northern archipelago where it had grown up, but it had no doubts that it was essentially so like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same gigantic and icy ocean broke itself here like there at the bank.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more annoyed after THAT WHAT EVENTS had been were than it its ancestors as a smuggler and beach robber, pulled from tavern to tavern, always ready to raise the hand against a woman, that denied itself them or verlachte.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stubbornness?</seg>
<seg id="95">That would have shown it a thick fist if it did not pay attention!</seg>
<seg id="96">Strike knutschen first you - Knutschen was the most frequently used word for an erotic attractive force between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads out of the console - it first knutschen and then.</seg>
<seg id="97">After Keverns view, the one unnecessary refinement was because the Knutschen represented even already an act of the force.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons gave to go it through its body a sign.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose out of the deck chair such as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">It felt also leaden, but the force of its sorrow surprised it.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They knew themselves yet hardly.</seg>
<seg id="103">It watched removed herself it, like he - so like of a room on the upper floor its companion it at the same time watched - a man, burdened through something, what he himself had conjured up.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, thought it.</seg>
<seg id="105">It felt a sudden pain for it and men in general although some had raised its hands against it.</seg>
<seg id="106">Did a man turn away of its, its back bended, embarrasses himself, overcomes, without battle spirit - why was that a view that they seemed to know well, if she not was able to remember yet a single time, at that it so something the current day ago already once seen had?</seg>
<seg id="107">When it was again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at its feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Esme nut tree, an intelligent and enthused 32-year-old researcher did not work some years before the just told incidents on behalf of Ofnow, that legislative supervision organ for the public mood, at a short presentation over the continued force on low and middle level in exactly the province, in which its reduction if abolition, at that soon to not to expect been become, in consideration of the moneys and energy, that become invests into the extermination of this force Were.</seg>
<seg id="109">"Much was done already, and much yet must be done to soothe wrote it, "around the innate aggressiveness of a people, that waged wars thousand and that therefrom won has, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human kindness historically was seen rarely perceived in spite of the high towering steeples between the sterns.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some characteristics turn out as ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The more highly the steeple, seems it, the slighter the passion that it wakes further.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries in the hearing of sentimental ballad, becomes intoxicated at stories over overcome difficulties and maintains to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but nevertheless there considers is not only the earlier raw-ness the rural communities just as as our municipal structures firmly in the hand, but rather also records to be the emerging of a new and insidious contentiousness at home, at the job, on the streets and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to the exaggeration," meant its mentor when he had read the entire report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I propose that you read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme nut tree sank its head.</seg>
<seg id="116">Must I ask also: you are atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe, I don't have to say that," answered Esme nut tree.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme referred to its right on privacy and denial of the statements.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again being quiet.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask that not," said Luther Rabinowitz in the end, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">That here is an unprejudiced job.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve an unprejudiced company.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of Hypersensibilität, that are absolutely acceptable and commendable at itself, can occasionally results how you introduced it, distort.</seg>
<seg id="126">You yourself have could be interpreted obviously prejudices against the church, and these things, that you "raw" designate as "insidious" and, by other just as well as an expression one naturally power and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If one ride around further on that, WHAT EVENTS IS IF IT IS EVENTS, as if it had happened, if it, yesterday happened would be, means to take the country its essential vigor.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme nut tree looked around itself while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind its head repeated a LED writing train in flamingo pink the pieces of advice that Ofnow more long had given the country in the last quarter century or.</seg>
<seg id="130">If smile at its neighbor, appreciate its partner, hear ballad, visit musicals, use explain its telephone, you speak, you, you hear to, you agree, apologize.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than a being quiet, the sung word is better than the written, but is nothing better than a love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I understand absolutely whereon you want out," answered say Esme nut tree with quiet voice when it certainly was, that its superior had spoken to end, "and I nothing other when that we are not healed yet so effective, how we show ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My apprehension lie therein that we regain ourselves without warning if possible at the same time, how we repeat the mistakes, that generally first to THAT WHAT EVENTS IS, IF IT led IS EVENTS.</seg>
<seg id="134">It are not this time however the other at which we leave out our fury and our mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to indicate therewith an angel patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," said it, "if you actions as" mistake" designate, that our grandparents not also committed perhaps or.</seg>
<seg id="138">They go also too far if you speak therefrom, that these left out its "fury" and its "mistrust" at "other".</seg>
<seg id="139">It should be actually not necessary to remember someone in your position that we do not speak in the understanding of the past such as in the protection of the present, about "us" and "other".</seg>
<seg id="140">There were gave no "we" and it no "other".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of the disorder, that is all what we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"Of that if we are honest to us even," ventured maintain can Esme to throw in, "no part of the company to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse no one.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done bad or well, what happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was at that time.</seg>
<seg id="146">In addition must nothing be said more - there are us we united.</seg>
<seg id="147">And exactly like no guilt shown will must, must be deleted also no guilt if such a cancellation would be appropriate and if there would be a way to delete it.</seg>
<seg id="148">But to what the past serves if we do not learn from that -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past serves in addition that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say in addition something -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz let collapse its pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider its report," said it and released it.</seg>
<seg id="153">At the next day when it went lived how to the work, it became run over of a motorcyclist, gone was who how passersby described, in a type of "brutal fury" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="2">The climb in the production in the Eurozone slowed down in August on the lowest point of the last 13 months, such an exactly observed study with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit purchase manager index of the producing business (PMI) fell in August on 50.7 in, after a state of 51.8 in in July.</seg>

<seg id="6">The numbers will arrive before the meeting of the European central bank (EZB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect a clear plan of the bank for the contact with a hesitant recovery of the Eurozone as well as for the threatening deflations in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are speculations in addition that the leader could make statements further the EZB, Mario Draghi, in the course this week, whether he takes a quantitative relief for the Eurozone into consideration, correspondingly that that were undertaken by Great Britain and the USA during the finance crisis.</seg>

<seg id="84">When he was smaller, he suffered under that - I remember me how he put himself sometimes on the sofa, that turned away face of us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Sleeping, its eyes were not open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I remember also yet how it threw all its weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, more largely than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I was certain so some hours long, that it dead would be and I would see it never again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I came myself after the explosion recovered and on the legs, I looked around myself, and the hell saw around me around, with body part lying around everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was certain absolute that my smaller boy impossibly could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember me that I shouted it," Damir, run, run away", but I was certain also so that it had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But it heard it and ran away it.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so life goes on unlike that of many other, for us.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgij Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy whose terrible picture became after the siege the symbol of the horror of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: The Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with its mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right of a picture of Georgij today</seg>
<seg id="96">Its covered in blood face was drawn of anxiety when it raced around its life, while Chechen terrorists its classmates shot down.</seg>
<seg id="97">Its picture was shocking one of that symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">Its mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had it for its first school day dropped before she loosely hurried in order to bring its older son Wladimir to the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so remained my smaller boy there for three terrible days alone," remember it.</seg>
<seg id="100">Very alone, there an entire family of relative of us was not, but they were killed everyone.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgij created it, to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The more closely this date moves, it is the heavier to keep in mind and to speak about that.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day at which we do not remind one us of this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is long here, I my, it would have happened yesterday, pursue some scenes out of these days me continually.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one ever will forget that, I promise that you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgently: The picture of Georgij (to the left) was shocking one of that the attack and was immortalized as a statue (to the right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that Georgij wanted to go this day so gladly to the school. It said, it wanted embrace its teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew first that it was alive, when I saw it on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is hidden here at home in the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I my also that the people feel in the world our pain thanks to this picture.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgij says today: "It happened can important, that so somewhat never again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we learn ever the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">The people examine such tragedy again and again and learn never the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they examine the fall of this Boeing in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Are we learned ever, what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world becomes something terrible.</seg>
<seg id="118">Can "I not understand how that is possible, for if you ask the people, wants to happen no one a war, therefore how that?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years are nothing at all in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of year in order to forget it a small few.</seg>
<seg id="121">It attacked my health and feel I it still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or for four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went later in 2004 again to the school and had every day anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates, who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">Therefore I go always into the sports hall if the 1st of September more closely moves.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to accord my my old childhood friend tribute.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is heavy for me, in which sports hall to go, but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I bemitleide myself not.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I locked this year the school and visit a medical university in Wladikawkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will become heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was an education in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to become a soldier, but my health let that not to.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that is not happened.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgij Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy who survived although he was caught on foot a homicidal terrorist</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught during the siege on foot a homicidal terrorist, but it created it, to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, it was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb, that was secured to the foot of a homicidal terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is actual a miracle that it was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it as if it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, that wanted to go as a secret service officer to the FSB, but this because of its health damages based on the siege do not do could.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is nothing what I let behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and the people say that children can handle easily bad experiences - I must say, that does not agree.</seg>
<seg id="144">"2006 I worked with psychologist and felt after that actually somewhat better, but I cannot forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would be forgotten gladly.</seg>
<seg id="146">The first and only time was 2005 - in the year after that - that I went again into the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost the consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will not return and ask myself never again there you please to show you where I sat in this famous picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">More surviving: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends never know that I do not keep in mind gladly or speak about that and it asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically it goes me good.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can run now well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I was not able to study at the secret service academy of the FSB in Saint Petersburg how I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents, also the medical sent in and answered it that it would not be possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">The animals were my second passion, therefore I went at the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have there already two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">It learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">It said: "I knew that I never would report my children of my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">About that children should know nothing and obviously also should not suffer it it.</seg>
<seg id="161">Its mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse if the anniversary more closely moves.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the ceremonies for remembering.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgij will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It doesn't have to be more violent for it yet much because it was there and I.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited at home for it and was not able to help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am God so grateful that he was returned me. Here in Beslan, everyone of them is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is heavily, to accept that if one somewhat so unfair strikes.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot participate because of its knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">It was operated repeatedly, it can run, but can drive no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that it overcame the horror to 50%, but one can overcome and forget that never totally.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience always will pursue us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that reinforces only my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people, whom I knew well and who were expensive me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the largest gift that God was able to make me, but my heart cries around the killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families, in which new children were born, but also of widows, who married never again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is to be accepted heavily that life goes on, also if one does not want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I never am forgotten how my heart burst in me, when I saw it in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see advances, what in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">For what do these people fight?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing itself mutually?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is not our country now very near and I can that almost believe.</seg>
<seg id="185">Were we can be earlier a friendly country, how it that we fight now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am certain that in the Ukraine already many children were killed and yet many are killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could grasp and throw out only all these rebels - so far away like only possible.</seg>

<seg id="191">It is now ten (to the right) and remembers not at all the cruelty</seg>
<seg id="192">The world stopped 2004 the breath when the baby Aljona in the arms of a Russian policeman was carried out of the siege by Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists let go it, but held its 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister in its cruelty Kristina and its brother Makhar in the school sports hall back.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, at that time three years old, escaped died, but Aljonas mother and sister in the homicidal bloodbath.</seg>
<seg id="195">Your father Ruslan married since then again and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana that he named after its lost daughter Kristina.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, today ten years old, remembers not the siege and is grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="197">"You are are now a large happy family and Aljona and Makhar both magnificent child," says a close friend.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 Tips for better lower water photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you would like to make gladly photos or videos under water, there is a selection at devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The most low-priced option is a watertight Point-and-Shoot how the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action Cam such as the GoPro HERO3 + Silver edition, that both are to be had for about 300 $.</seg>
<seg id="4">I received these photos in a family festival with several cameras, that are all to a price of less than 350 $ available.</seg>
<seg id="5">There is independent of the equipment a couple of rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Control your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also if you have a watertight camera, reassure yourself that the battery compartment and other specialties thickly are locked.</seg>
<seg id="8">Adjust your camera also to the photos or videos, that you want to receive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and video camcorder control scene modes and reception modes, with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen lower water conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, you test, into which depth your equipment is operable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only for up to 5 feet allowed, other until 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search in our purchase leader and the estimations for digital cameras for conventional and watertight models.</seg>
<seg id="13">If make multiple reception - because many will not work out.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-Shoot-cameras do not control a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action Cams normally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also if you have a LCD to look at is it difficult, this under water, and the correct picture attitude a matter of luck is.</seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore you make many receptions.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera controls a row mode, with which a row are made by receptions with easily changed exposure attitudes, you use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Remain near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light will remove yourself dramatically worse, ever further you of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you possible remain include in make therefore close to the surface, if you a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">Through it you can bring also more color into your photos; the more deeply you go, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approach close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is also at country a good advice, but it is under water all the more more important because of the bad lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is very especially important if you work with an Action Cam: These devices control often a firm wide-angle lens, what means, that you should must poet at your objects up to, if these should fill out the entire picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization such as the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advising anaesthesia physician, he dedicated suffer its career of the task, that both to save the Agonie of the illness such as the torments of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Under its patient, remembers his wife, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, who had to live with the devastating effects of tortures.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the physicians, during the treated predominantly with somewhat entirely other busied are: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, it was however that whose life of suffering began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel me," wrote it in May this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to pull myself together up.</seg>
<seg id="8">While it fought with the flu-like symptoms, it noted that it made his wife Juliet impatiently accusations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wants all rather immediately than later", noted it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was for a week on a business trip, Lawson felt entirely unusual would prove and disturbs without reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anything lay in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">It asked a colleague to undertake a x-ray investigation of its breast.</seg>
<seg id="13">It had been only two weeks ago in the French Alps to the ski load.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the x-ray investigation existed.</seg>
<seg id="15">It suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer, that attacks the breast fur, therefore the skin covering the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">How in most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is to be determined usually heavily.</seg>
<seg id="17">While for example some smokers become ill with lung cancer, all lung cancer sick early smokers were not.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Mesotheliom is differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, that once as a "miracle material" counted however in the meantime as deadly recognized became.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore how easily.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is in the end a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous asbestos type was used in Great Britain since the '1960's no longer when the industry promised voluntarily in addition to use this no longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Where it yet was used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumber, construction worker, carpenters and shipyard worker for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial danger material out of another time it seems to be today hardly yet serious.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this even contentment is inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Great Britain, seems it, experiences today the highpoint of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With altogether 2,500 deaths per year, many people die twice as at this illness as in traffic accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and presumable future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos illegally has been for years (1999 became all asbestos types forbidden), is that that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not restricted on former worker of the building industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was is, and frequently yet, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial boundaries, occupations or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no protection room.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals, in which we should become yet healthy, were settled already as an exit herd of this deadly Karzinogens.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">It was also no plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It fell it in the deed heavily to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then it found out it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks so as if in the tunnels at the Guy's it hospital, where I graduated for six years my education, a quantity asbestos available was". wrote it.</seg>
<seg id="42">All - students, nurse, physicians and doorman - use the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">Does one ask himself how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same illness?</seg>
<seg id="44">It unfortunately at least partially was able to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four physicians, that at the Guy's it hospital instructed became, and that in the last five years at Mesotheliom of sick", wrote he 2010 in a letter, "am I the last, that yet lives".</seg>
<seg id="46">How many will of us yet become ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When it died on the 17th of February of this year, it was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">That was an unusually long over lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The illness ends always deadly.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can repeat therefore only Lawsons question: Will "like many of us yet become ill"?</seg>
<seg id="53">The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, supposes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Great Britain will come presumably for succumbing, altogether 90,000 of the illness to the victim fallen be become.</seg>
<seg id="54">That therefrom still have no idea in the moment that they will die so.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A short view of the acts of the courts, at which the concerned turn frequently because of compensation demands, shows how far the scourge of the Mesothelioms already is spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June these years gave notice & Spencer for example to, Janice of all careless would prove stopped asbestos to have.</seg>
<seg id="58">It worked for nine years for the chain, of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. All was first 18 years as when it began its activity in M&S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now it has two children in the Zwanzigern.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this thing," says it, "I had heard never of Mesotheliom, knew I not yet once really something over asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have thought that that would concern me once.</seg>
<seg id="63">There is only a few people who know much over asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">Fact is that the term asbestos a substance, but rather a group of six minerals does not relate itself.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name stems of the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that flexibly makes the material resistant and.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in the building business.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotil, also as a white asbestos well known, is the asbestos by far most frequently found today in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof disks, foot bottom disks, pipe isolation, boiler isolation, even for brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly as other asbestos forms, is looked at however nevertheless of the EU and the WHO as a "large health risk" with possible death consequence.</seg>
<seg id="70">The brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) is more dangerous however.</seg>
<seg id="71">Great Britain was once that importer world's largest of brown asbestos, and experts assume that "there are clear, however indirect references, that these was" a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten.</seg>
<seg id="72">A colleague of notice & Spencer was stopped in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford streets, London, asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice all did not see itself perhaps as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto points on that there that its story is unusual in no case.</seg>
<seg id="74">It produced a study of the concerned, in which represented becomes, that "an essential share of the Mesotheliome became" without well known exposure through work or in the house probable through asbestos contact in the environment caused.</seg>
<seg id="75">A large part of these contacts is based its statements after upon the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks so, as could no one therefrom go out to be certain.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report of Goddard Consulting, that examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people could have been also in the heart of the government, unknowing the material exposed.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipings had contaminated behind the from shot room of the parliament with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be swirled up by air movements" "strong somewhat as harmless as.</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of parliament frequently are accused to attend to its own interests, but here it sees so from, as would be true the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the direction of the parliamentary community service existed on that, that the Westminsterpalast had received a "clean health testimony", it is in the meantime uncontested that 1 billion£work expense must be raised over several years in order to renovate the parliament, to modernize the electric installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the general choices 2015 the delegates will meet probably sooner in the suggested QE2-Konferenzzentrum than on the green banks in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report referred also on that that "the existence became not" handled by asbestos corresponding to the respective determinations.</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this Missmanagement life will cost.</seg>
<seg id="83">All what one can do now, is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person, that the contact with asbestos never exactly determine was able to be Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">How Andrew Lawson the 50-year-old Abbott assumes that it was stopped during its work in hospitals the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have in a hospital worked, in the asbestos complaint positively decided became", says it, "but I can it in my case do not prove.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all places, at which one worked, and at the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">On what it yet exactly remembered the day is itself beginning of December 2009 at which it got so a kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">It was 45, and an operation carried out just late evenings.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had violent shivering.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came very suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terribly.</seg>
<seg id="93">I believed to create the trip home no longer.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a physician, Abbott knew that the pains of the breast fur that stemmed skin around its lungs around.</seg>
<seg id="95">But how Janice all it had no reason to assume a Mesotheliom.</seg>
<seg id="96">It did not go a month to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Surprised physicians made x-ray of its breast and set Pleurakathether on in order to take fluid out of the lungs and to test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">Its troubles remained however without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Its health improved itself slowly, and it turned at its job back.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time, the symptoms returned however, frequently after sporting activity and violent breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">A patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice came 2011 and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom.</seg>
<seg id="102">But also now Abbott did not connect this with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end its patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 deteriorated Abbotts condition again and its family doctor its CT Scans and x-ray to an expert group brought themselves.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott suffer had felt for the first time, was introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib fur and the breast fur.</seg>

<seg id="113">Suddenly had Abbott appointments with Macmillan nurse of which one recommended it to take itself a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">First now concept it the size of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out very far spread was, that asbestos, especially in large public buildings, in which pipes were isolated often with asbestos," it says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people, who were stopped the asbestos in these buildings, become ill now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so Mesotheliom encounters now younger people who did not work in the typical occupations.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolation in hospitals lay under the earth, therefore patients were not stopped probably sooner the material.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many colleagues, who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other, (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate (like it Graham Abbott often did), came with largest probability in contact with the poisonous substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It appears that over several decades after the war of hospitals for the patients possibly life rescuing were, but life-threatening for the treating physicians.</seg>
<seg id="121">It yet is removed also today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students turned down its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it concerns not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was used based on its fabulous isolating and flame impeding characteristics frequent in offices, businesses, libraries and city halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Also schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Actually many people had probably the first asbestos contact in the class room.</seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, turned down student its Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">On web pages, the subject of asbestos in schools now frequently is addressed.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses such as foot bottom disks or barn roofs contained standard moderate asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It is an industry poison that in large parts of our real estate contained is," notes Andrew Morgan, that lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in its process against Guy's it hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In a case, the single contact that occurred to a concerned woman was, the abstract of a garden barn in the 1970ern.</seg>
<seg id="132">Therefore you pay attention how you dismantle your garden barn.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the illness is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">A while lasts "to process that," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went again to the work and tried to make further, but I noticed that I was not able to concentrate on that, what I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in the practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and had to attend to me even.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well yes, I no further christmas will experience.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the largest difficulty, the telescope change of the position of a physician to that of a patient was.</seg>
<seg id="140">He remembers patients countless how before it on that how overwhelmed he was by all the information, with which he had to come right.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very heavily, to receive that everything," says it.</seg>
<seg id="142">Did "I ask still have my physician" how long I"?</seg>
<seg id="143">And one gave me yet about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "well yes, I will experience no further christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">It was that then"."</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life maintenance mechanism - the breathing itself -, that the deadly cancer causes.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused through asbestos contact.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can itself in the breast fur, that skin fix around the lungs around.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fiber irritate the breast fur and can release cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem emerges with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," so professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax-physician who changed 2001 at the Guy's it hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital of which Andrew Lawson assumes that it stopped it the asbestos, is ironic would prove now, a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other that were stopped probably also during its education in the hospital the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "become it of the breath process at the edge pressed where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">Inherently it is from the beginning invasive.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options in other cancer diseases do not function in Mesotheliom so good.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation is for example be named disputed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some my that it would be valued an attempt.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies that.</seg>
<seg id="160">"One cannot excise the breast fur," says it.</seg>
<seg id="161">They get around with the knife not therefore.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer does not address "on chemotherapy very well," that "effect shows", but does not heal.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there is long-term survival," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But at the end, they die everyone.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately some patients live actually long, much more long than expects.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Graham Abbott fights two and a half years after its own diagnosis still.</seg>
<seg id="168">After it had contacted Mesotheliom, came Abbott in contact with Andrew Lawson, that four years had become after its diagnosis an a-man-supports and consultation office for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, cancer headquarters," imagined he in calls cheerfully.</seg>
<seg id="170">"It was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">It had received its diagnosis 4 years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles, that would last four months and would extend its life presumably only by a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was doubted," say it.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to abandon.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson created appear it however "the things light of somewhat more positive in one to let".</seg>
<seg id="176">After the consultation of several physicians, Abbott, its treatment with prof. Loic long Lazdunski, heart-Thorax-specialist concluded to continue it at the Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage through it that I must not further reprimanded become, I called simply on and got an appointment," gives Graham to.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would be received must a transfer and wait must for the permission of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is decisively for Mesotheliom become ill in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments fail in the end inevitable, stand many concerned of another financial worry - over the future of the families, that leave behind it.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been since 1898 well known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what in the 1960ern changed is itself, that one recognized, that also a very slight load represented a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the businesses began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's it hospital enclosed its case in the end, but it was not that, what names Morgan a "full compensation", because Lawson was not able to prove with absolute security, that be Mesotheliom on an asbestos contact at the Guy's it to lead back was.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation to its death, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed it however that "the asbestos fiber in the concerned cellar area in the 1990ern became" removed.</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">It is actual for Mesotheliom become ill, that strive for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a firm or a job - normally decade after the occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of its earlier employers were sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can lost go.</seg>
<seg id="193">And that that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for it, but very certainly with the complainants.</seg>
<seg id="194">As a reaction on that there were this year clear new legislations, that it makes for Mesotheliom concerned simpler, to sue for a compensation, also if its earlier employers are to be discovered no longer.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law arranged a fund promoted by the insurance industry of 350 million£for everyone, prove can accuse can that were diagnosed after July 2012, a contact, but no one.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the complainants 80 received communicate can would have percent its, what a court in a normal compensation process them - about 120,000£.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful proposing in the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom concerned that 350 million represented£a "very good work" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"That is a deal of insurers for insurer," says it, and points on that it concerns in this sum one-quarter its, what insurers should have paid, if the time were not passed over about that and Mesotheliom become ill could find the businesses and normally could accuse it.</seg>
<seg id="200">Also Mike Penning, at that time work minister and pension minister, admitted that the law would not be "perfect".</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning such as Morgan admitted that in view of of seven dead daily some fast actions would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people suffer so very and need today aid," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom law in December the past year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this time Graham Abbott has been for 19 months in the hands of prof. Loic long Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After its first consultations, long Lazdunski recommended an operation of which it expects in contrast a positive effect to Tom Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied of a radiation therapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"That is natural with the most important," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">One sees that again and again with patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is there something what lets continue you.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you abandon, it goes you very quickly more badly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott subjected itself in March 2012 of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="212">It had the end of August the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind itself.</seg>
<seg id="213">Nachsorgescans showed no sign at all of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had in March 2014 a Scan.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several cancer spots around my breast.</seg>
<seg id="216">I became just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">That is life concluding.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott subjected itself six chemotherapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now no trace of the Tumore is more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physical and psychically very strenuous.</seg>
<seg id="222">They must think of practical things - over the money if I am no longer, for example, or my wives show how the boiler time attitude functions.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you become negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">They must look forwards.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is that not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"For parents, that is heavy," says it.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is to be known heavy, what one should say and like much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness, with which I would not become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.</seg>
<seg id="231">It told got it its friends and we soon very many calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">It did not say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are endure must somewhat, that all cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte, such conversations are not gotten through of hope, not by a trace of hope for survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The illness brings (so like in conclusion also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denies Hong Kong right on government choice, demonstrators swear reward</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided in spite of the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the choices 2017 through the Hongkonger constituency.</seg>
<seg id="3">This action fuels probably the long announced protests in Hong Kong business district while activists led the planning and mobilization in addition within less hours after the announcement into the ways.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese people congress permits it the communist leaders basically not to reject everyone of Beijing faithful candidate.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us yet furiously," said legal expert Emily tepidly, chairperson of the democratic party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not that what had promised Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="7">One designed the inhabitants of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In its defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice secretary-general of the permanent committee of the national people congress said that the allowance of public nominations would be in the choices for the Hongkonger government to "chaotic".</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997 when Great Britain returned the control of Hong Kong the Chinese, promised Beijing let select the inhabitants from 2017 the government chair.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there are the citizens of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a nomination committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a new clause, only candidates "with love are supposed to be allowed moreover to the country and love to Hong Kong".</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and audience most effective protests have taken place in Hong Kong for some years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the per democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace whose organizers threatened therewith stands to seal off the finance district if Beijing allows no real general right to vote.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-followers in the rain had met itself within less hours after the announcement before the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the demonstration, the organizers said that its movement had reached a new step of civil Ungehorsams and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They made in addition however no nearer statements to avoid apparently around problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an Online communication, the organizers announced that the movement took "the occupation of the headquarters district only as a last means into consideration, an action that should take place only then, if all dialogue chances are emptied and no other choice exists.</seg>
<seg id="19">It harms us to have to say that today all dialogue chances were emptied and the occupation of the headquarters district definitively will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong prepared themselves for days for the announcement of Beijing, and intensified security measures counted on Sunday before the government building including police powers and barricade.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest becomes through the feeling of many in hung Kong reinforced that they lose slowly the control of its city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The train of people of the mainland reinforces the competition around products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover the fear are awake that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and speech freedom begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement because it would endanger the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong -.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests of which they speak could cause large economic damage, depending how many are involved on that and like long they last," said legal expert Regine ip that criticizes the movement for some time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We want to stir up no fears that Hong Kong runs except inspection.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investments.</seg>
<seg id="28">The nationally controlled media China reported also recently over the democracy activists in Hong Kong as agents driven subversive by western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this summer, activists organized participated an unofficial referendum to the rights to vote, in which 780,000 people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize race question and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed beginning of this month of a police officer in Ferguson, Mo..</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants lifted its hands into the air and sang, waited "hands highly, do not shoot," during it before the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the Erschießung of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a change in the Online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After its experience, white feminist commentators set the sex before the race if it goes therefore to address reproduction right and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions in the mediator increased west however and received notice in the entire country, saw Perez that the answers of white women revolved to 100% around the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">In that came the answers black women compare to shortly after the shots of the 9th of August the personal essays with title such as "thought to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism revolves not only around the suppression of women" comparatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, the one important variation meant.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not believe that one finds in the feminism many people, who, over the white are and speak privileges on so hochklassige type," said it.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt pressed in addition to express something to the occurrences.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis, in which we find us and because the situation is in Ferguson so ethnisiert, that they must express that.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohios State University brought Ferguson problems at the light, which black Americans are stopped every day, that however as a "woman subjects" in the cultural room are not observed.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something funny on Facebook over me and my partner and get 150 Likes of everywhere here," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post somewhat about, how colored in its own country stand under siege, the being quiet is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it not be certain for women to speak publicly over a relation, but over security in the public room"? asked it.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women such as Mitchell, the race, sex and sexuality in the story of the USA studied have, gives it no Dichotomie between race problems and sex problems.</seg>
<seg id="17">For it, black women had not the luxury to separate the subjects cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women connect now the subjects of races and sex in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen, says Angela Hattery, professor for women and sex investigation at the George Mason University that its predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and was the establishment almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story in order to justify the lynch murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point, at which white fighters assessed for the woman right to vote such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th century of analyzed and, that the battle was able to be successful for the right to vote only for respectively a group: Women or black.</seg>
<seg id="22">"You made the decision to support the woman right to vote, and the right to vote for black later should come," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If one remembers such things, becomes one with power aware why colored women do not trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We made our job not well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women at the same time to protect its husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also after women 1920 received the right to vote, it lasted another decade until white women against the lynching in the Association organized themselves of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group emerged ask for according to almost 40 years the original aid of sides of black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions is on the questions turned-up by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - a mirror of the time, in which white feminists played "catching" with the problems, with which black women sat down since generations apart.</seg>
<seg id="29">Would it "not be control so seriously would take do" crazy, if the activists, that such traditional feminist platforms the right on upbringing of a child like it that with the right on conception inspection? asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation, that constructed its career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means, try to understand now, what means that.</seg>
<seg id="31">The well known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks to the Erschießung of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article of Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian in which she demands more protests of white Americans to the subject of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women, the one other, but parallel reasons for that have to understand a danger characterizing the body - and opinions to the race, that in public surveys clearly differently are - the variations cite become," wrote Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for one sooner intersektionalen feminism, in which race subjects just as as sex subjects are addressed, some of its commentaries are astonished to the race subject in America yet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Did Christina in the summer, researcher on the American Enterprise institute and author of "Who stoles Feminism"? say vis-à-vis She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far vulnerableer are than its sisters," to its earlier criticism stand however Steinems comments to Ferguson in contrast.</seg>
<seg id="35">There is now hunderte of special programs for girl and young women, but almost nothing for boy.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the white house recently a small program, My Brother's it Keeper, put on in order to help vulnerable young black and hispanischen men, gave it annoying reactions of many feminists, under that Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ratio of the police to that of the black Community is not the single problem that into the foreground of the Mainstreamfeminismus presses itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US boundary police took up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minor at the south west boundary of the country this year, also the subject of the immigration reform steps again at the surface - this time as a woman subject.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax load of businessmen in the room Washington climbs with the economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customers, more Verkäufe and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It means also higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">National and local tax replies for business in the country increased in the past year easily while the economic recovery sped up, such a newly published study in the past week, and the firms in the room Washington formed no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Jointly 27.6 billions paid business in the room District, Maryland and Virginia $ at national and local places in the fiscal year 2013, a climb around 3.8 percent vis-à-vis the revenue of 2012 in the amount of 26.6 billions $.</seg>
<seg id="6">The national and local tax burden of the businesses climbed in the past year around 4.3 percent on 671 billions $ on, in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the replies 2009 sinking several years and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">National taxes climbed more strongly at than the local duties, around 4.3 percent, so the study, that was carried out by the service agency seriously & Young with the center for national taxation, a tax politics group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than the half of the tax collections of the District, 56 percent, comes from business tax while 36 percent of the revenue Marylands come from business.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia obtains the slightest tax collections with 28 percent out of business.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large part of the climb in the tax collections is established in a recovery of the real estate values of the businesses, say the researchers, what led to an increase of the real estate tax around 3.7 percent per year after the three successive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">During a large part of these profits out of large countries such as California, New York and Texas came, seems to be true the flow also for the room Washington.</seg>
<seg id="12">Business in the District, Maryland and Virginia 2012 - paid jointly a climb in the course of a year over 10 billions $ at national and local real estate taxes in the past year, in comparison with 9.6 billions $ around 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the real estate value is not in Maryland so effective in the increase of national and local tax collections because here the real estate tax amount to itself on tightly more than one-fifth of the tax replies of business.</seg>
<seg id="14">Business in Virginia and D.C. pay almost the half of its national and local taxes in the form of real estate tax.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland, following happens: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax zone around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of Non-profit-organizations, that pay no real estate tax," said Douglas Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is forced therefore to depended for example much more on the income tax, around which to be able to offer same services, that other countries offer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The youngest recovery in the tax collections through business cannot be assigned alone the recovery of the real-estate market</seg>
<seg id="18">Business revenue seem to recover also, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Business in the region reported over income tax in country organizations of 2.3 billions $ in comparison with 2.1 billions per year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took 1 billion $ in business income tax on, the highest sum of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the trend into the same direction goes, climbs the local tax load for business not at all three places uniformly on.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Anstiegsrate in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent while the climb in Maryland was clearly higher, 4.9 percent to the national average.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a below average tax recovery of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the clearly slightest business income taxes (in all three gives it firm business tax rates) with 6 percent in all three jurisdictions.</seg>
<seg id="25">The business tax rate in Maryland is about 8.25 percent and in the District in comparatively high 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A comparable study of the US chamber at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia slighter national and local business tax are demanded and altogether a better tax climate rules than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study, the District was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="28">In spite of the advantages, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina dismissed laws to the decline of its business tax rates this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, that same sentence such as Virginia, and the sentence sink becomes in the coming year to 5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the country reaches further its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the business income tax rate of the country until 2017 until to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems to go Washington better to the small businesses in the room, and they pay therefore more taxes national and local, so the youngest study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Business tax, that as a personal income tax by small businessmen paid become climbed - a transition structure, after that most small businesses organized are - in the District, Maryland and Virginia in the past year around 20 percent on 2.4 billions $ on, a clear faster growth rate than the business tax altogether.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the climb will stop in the business taxes in the entire country probably this year, with an increase of the general more defense tax collections for the country and the local governments around 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the preceding year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless the room could Washington afterwards lame if the edition abridgment of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billions $</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON confirmed just now, what had reported on Monday morning to information: The Online retailer - and video maker, and a multitude other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for 1.04 billions $ (970 million US$).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement does not come surprisingly, because no one had expected an acceptance of Twitch, but rather because largely assumed became, that YouTube would acquire the business.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it looked so, as would be the sale thing concluded by Twitch at the video service of Google for a cool billion, and the collaboration appear also naturally.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, that was established only three years ago as a Justin. tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead it became fast a platform for player, who wanted its Bravourstücke in games of published, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's it play", a video genre, in which know-it-all give that (usually older) games an Anstrich of secret science theater, are chosen on YouTube already very.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is just so that YouTube often is named, if one wants to describe Twitch, therefore the message became that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, somewhat bored received, a textbook example of an established technology business that buys up a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a riddle why the deal with YouTube did not come into being, because the business was ready according to reports to pay just as much like Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All, what we know in the moment about that, is these statements of Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We decided us for Amazon because they believe in our Community, they divide want to help us our values and long-term visions and it at the same time to arrive" more quickly there.</seg>
<seg id="12">A further secret is, honestly said, the incredible follow from Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snob such as, that explain that it dear sport to watch drive as at the same time to grasp is it heavily, the attraction, that assumes to watch other in the playing instead of even the control console into the hand to take me.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a thing to view a friend at 3 o'clock mornings over the shoulder while it slinks through Resident Evil, and somewhat entirely other to watch, a spinner at the same time, how he is shot 20 times one after another in Call of Duty into the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">You now just could look at all these games.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem lies therein that many of the most popular games are today egos games, therefore the watching can be without own control of the view perspective a really good prescription for headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the fast conduits, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age graduate games entire in record time, are, entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as a game masterly or humor masterly is not there, its Twitch canal is probably not so very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do skeptic such as I know already therefrom?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is that source fourth largest by Internet traffic tip.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly does Amazon want to make from that money?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video, how YouTube Twitch simply would have been able to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something what would have each business gladly: Thousands of young men, who are courted as advertise customers.</seg>
<seg id="24">How the chairperson of Twitch, Shear said,, Amazon and Twitch both "believe in the future of the Gaming," and the medium does not show no signs of an atrophy, yet once - swallow - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the hop castle in the castle garden festival was happening at the Saturday a few things.</seg>
<seg id="2">The draft of the organizers agreed.</seg>
<seg id="3">In spite of the strong downpour on Saturday evening approximately 1200 music fans to the opus-Air-festival in the castle garden came.</seg>
<seg id="4">Occasionally the entrance had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salt frond l light and joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">Out of two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brightness should for that opuses Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden at the day and in the evening through various shows radiate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and the joke comes anyway of alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">That appeared already from the early Saturday when the first visitors to the opus Air opened themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that is arrive them.</seg>
<seg id="13">All around the provision states on the castle garden meadow had itself it Salzwedeler, but also guests out of the nearer and further environment cozily made.</seg>
<seg id="14">They pursued the first live entrances, wippten with the foot in the tact, wetted cool drinks - shortly: Relaxation pure and enjoyment were announced.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that diagonally through the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">During itself the one sand white on covers on the extra angekarrten at the beach bar lümmelten, other itself at one-quarter wine in the Vinothek labten, raged the new generation on the hop castle, that was a large attraction point for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But also in the child make-up, the voluntary helpers in the truest sense of the word had all hands fully to do in order to become the press gentleman and to do magic imagination full creations into the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The larger used the Kickertische or were involved in a Skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot Crew aligned out of salt frond.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the large rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17.30 clock, it beat down sought on the visitors, above all families the expanse and dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">This did yet the attractiveness of the festival no discontinuance.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It came more people than expects", said Ron Sem, that spoke about a "success on the entire line".</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore would stand a repetition of the large party in the coming year toward nothing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although at contents and size of the Events yet worked will must, Sem in a first balance made on Sunday vis-à-vis the people voice clearly.</seg>
<seg id="25">As annoying it designated that meanwhile the entrance had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously the security firm had been booked with too little powers.</seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Many that already had paid came no longer on the terrain.</seg>
<seg id="28">The resonance had been very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first careful estimation, the Salzwedeler with organizer of about 1200 visitors, that romped about in the castle garden, spoke.</seg>
<seg id="30">There was problems in the tone technology.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler hiply-Hop-volumes Blocks`n`Rox interrupted unnerves its entrance therefore.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not in a position, to create a half-way sensible Sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned Shisha Lounges could not be constructed because the tents could not be brought because of a tire breakdown after salt frond.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In the next year become it however at the same time be", so the organizer.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of the Amula-opus-Airs was of the numbers of visitors more than arrive.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">To be sure the organizers committed some mistakes, removes will must, that yet are forgiven in the first time, but in the second levy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers must put away criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve Euro has one simply more expects", expresses itself Melanie Meier on the organization side.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have you unfortunately a little received", means Ele carpenter at same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not see the initial problems very so closely.</seg>
<seg id="42">I find it very good that many not only stupidly talk nonsense, but rather also really try to place something on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hat from"!, writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now a year time remains the organizers in order to turn down these points of criticism.</seg>

<seg id="4">As an example for the reconstruction of the wolf advice houses castle the deceased Richard Dimbath, former chairperson of the wolf advice houses of castle friends, the project in the French Guédelon cited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet a year ago no good climate between the castle society and the castle friend wolf advice Hausen ruled.</seg>

<seg id="7">Now move both warehouses on each other to: Discussions about a joint action are supposed to be led already soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">The society boards of directors confirm that Torsten Sjöberg (castle society) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends) on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have Mr. Piffl called and proposed, that we us once put together could", reports Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">In its opinion, all members of both societies could pull in the future again at a cord.</seg>
<seg id="11">So more quickly visible successes are to be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle friends had around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until finally a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in mind, the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the terrain stands for the castle society around Sjöberg at frontmost place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second chairperson of the castle friends, was happy according to own statements about the call very.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death, it projects the castle friend.</seg>

<seg id="17">"After death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have rest let" the society activities out of respect first of all. This phase" "think had been necessary go on could" in order "to consider, how it.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl, the new chairperson should go then into the conversation with the castle society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until there, the castle friends could make themselves also a current mood picture within its grouping.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is a candidate for the chair momentarily not yet, says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone becomes" be found. He himself does not want to run for office because he has its residence in bath Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairperson should be a wolf advice house.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer wanted at the project "but very gladly further cooperate".</seg>
<seg id="24">The different standpoints in things reconstruction will exist remain in the eyes Piffls probably in next time.</seg>
<seg id="25">It lauds Dimbath as a "missionary", who believed always in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is no air lock.</seg>
<seg id="27">Through a high participation of the population as well as through voluntary helpers out of all world, let they be a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "Also I was sceptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the course of the time, I arrived more and more at the conviction that it is meaningful to push the project". An "all attitude feature" could be created for the rafter city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here there is yes nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover the project would be through EU subsidies, visitor ticket and potential sponsors affordably, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">I want to throw" "the idea of the reconstruction personally therefore not simply over board. It hopes that the castle societies in this point perhaps something moves.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whose goal to document, the story first of all, "is important and good".</seg>

<seg id="7">"I have me thought, I chop the entire frustration of the Thursday purely and schnalzte it under the slat", meant the 26-year-old smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Schrammel had encountered on the 13th Novmember 2010 to the previously last time in a national league party, that was yet for reed.</seg>

<seg id="32">We not however also may believe that now all is good.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was not able to challenge the meaning of its roll for the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is yet a very young team that I can help in the moment very.</seg>
<seg id="35">That comply in certain phases yet with me at", said yard man.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig coach Michael Baur had itself and to reproach its team few.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands the reception of "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with the east Ukraine of Kiev</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian Präsident Wladimir Putin according to demanded Russian published reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government adjusts the battles against the separatists in the East of the country and directly with negotiations to that-ness" receives "national the disloyal region.</seg>
<seg id="3">Its speaker Dimitri Peskow placed later clearly that Putin not therewith had meant, that the zone standing under the inspection the separatist of the east Ukraine would become a part of Russia, but rather that status newly are defined become would must vis-à-vis the Ukraine in order to give the russischsprachigen region the power to the representation of its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putins proclamation at the Kiewer government to negotiations at eye level with the per Russian rebellious fits however to the strategy five months ago apparently pursued by it since the beginning the riot: Aid for the separatists in the taking in of zones and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west.</seg>
<seg id="5">Putin convicted in an interview with the national television station canal one the Ukrainian military campaign to the back conquest of the zone held by separatist in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, that were taken in in March and April, after Moscow had rummaged annexed the Ukrainian peninsula on the 18th of March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently the taken in zone as a "Novorossija" or "new Russia" designated, a concept that reminds one of the before revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin referred on that, that all that, that are attack hope caught" in the course of the campaign of Ukrainian politician for the choices on the 26th Oct and during government groups civil communities in the zones held by separatist for early peace conversations "in its illusions, Itar Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must receive immediately detailed conversations, not only to technical questions, but rather also to the political organization of the company and the country status of the south east Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the person living there," said he.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said, refer to seen become would must that Putins the national-ness in the context with the larger autonomy, that is discussed for months by the Kiewer leadership, in order to disperse fears in russischsprachigen zones that its cultural and linguistic rights would be endangerd.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern zones the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">It concerns here not negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it not around a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine concerns, but rather an internal conflict in the Ukraine".</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of that "false interpretation" of Putins comments unterstrich the claim to leadership of Russia in the contact with the separatist rebellion in the East in contrast to the direct Annektion of that rummaged, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in the east Ukraine because that of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and surveys yielded out of the time before the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy, that was addressed by Russian diplomat on international forums, would give give the regional governments in the Ukraine authority own trade agreement and outside relations to negotiate, and so the Kremlin de facto the control of a zone, that connects rummaged the Russian country zone with that.</seg>
<seg id="15">The five months ago annexed peninsula in the black sea is the homeland harbor for the large part of the Russian navy as well as an important trade harbor and historic coast region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and that rummaged is in addition rich at mines, factories and foundry, that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian Präsident Petro Poroshenko proposed in its speech to the inauguration on the 7th of June that the Ukrainian legislation - after reelection - additions should consider to the constitution, with which the respective zones a larger control is cleared of its finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But its presentation of autonomy seems in sharp contrast, to which the Kremlin and the separatist rebels to stand, whose armament is reproached and for Aufstachelung Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Request last Putins at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level, followed after a further advancing of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tank are penetrated over that peaceful region along the Asowschen sea into the east Ukraine previously.</seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists supported by Russia the first step of a campaign to the acceptance of the strategic coast region received rummaged is in the hand stroke, that of security officials Ukrainian according to fears to that, the inspection by Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason massive civil and military preparations started in order to secure Mariupol, a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants, that lies rummaged between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday in a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine, an earlier Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We stand shortly before a point, at which it gives no back more," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Troops strange thousand and hunderte of strange tanks are now on the territory of the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit concluded no concrete actions, that leadership demanded the design of further sanction against Russia that should step in an unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis effective.</seg>
