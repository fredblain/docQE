Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The congressmen, Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as a civil right.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
"As trade unions, die, die, the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
I am so proud, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee Ermächtigungsgesetz.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in discrimination because of the organization of trade unions - as with other forms of discrimination, and stops as anti-trade union-minded forces.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The supplement to the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for discriminating against NHS workers to organize a union representation to sue in a civil court for justice, and to obtain damages or criminal money - is a useful and necessary initiative.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In fact, the best way to understanding what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the connection back to a very American idea.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Despite the setbacks, which have been subjected to the unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans have encouraged countries all over the world to recognise labour rights, and to expand.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There was a time in which millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and freedom of association in the same breath.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In full awareness that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "workers ' rights of association and collective bargaining and action are guaranteed."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
When the United States after World War II Germany occupy pushed General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff, the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans have a clause that explicitly testified: " the right to form associations in order to safeguard and improve the health and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and each profession or business.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it is null and void; seeks to measures are illegal.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the Chair of the International Commission on Human Rights, drafted by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors of a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests, or to join them."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
When this country consulted other countries how to forge civil and democratic societies, told Americans that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and protected - that this union will take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies should be allowed.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Once these rights in America came under fire, it is actually very wise, the American ideal of that working people must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
As pastor, Martin Luther King Jr., 50 years ago said:
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The story is a great teacher.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
All now know that the labour movement is not restricted to the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
By raising the living standards of millions of people work miraculously created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history is preserved.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
History remembers, and we should do the same.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the rights of citizens as a protection against discrimination in the creation of workers ' representatives - is long overdue.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America made in the past, and the promises of democracy.

<seg id="9">
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment to the doctors from the two clinics, which are not connected to the lawsuit, and also had applied for admission rights.

</seg>
<seg id="16">
In their arguments against the verdict, said representatives of the state of Louisiana, that they would not punish doctors because of the performance of abortions, while their applications for Patienteneinweiserechte were still pending.

Lenny Henry: my father never took me in his arms.

Never said "I love you"

<seg id="3">
Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and her relationship was limited.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and was born out of the series on Radio 4.

<seg id="6">
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with a lively melodies.
</seg>

But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.

<seg id="8">
He visited "many" treatments after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It was hard to know him.

</seg>
<seg id="15">
I have never had such a conversation with him.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
A large part of my life, it was this serious guy in the corner of the newspaper.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won an insight into what life was like for him.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is a little brighter now, but they are dark, quite smoky, deep stygische mazes with Flammenstößen and smoke and a lot of soot.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
My father, earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him was growing.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents ' expressions of love.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Only when it came to my mother at the end of their lives badly, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
</seg>

So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said " you have to be radical.

</seg>
<seg id="44">
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then, after some of August Wilson.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
That is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.
</seg>
<seg id="46">

<seg id="47">
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he people imitation and wrote about it on New Faces.

<seg id="48">
His television career began in the mid-1970s, "I was looking for a fairly long time, the only black imitator/comedian on television."

<seg id="49">
He learned at work.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an efficient jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star of television, and it was really difficult.

<seg id="54">
Somehow, I just wish that it would never have happened, but I do not think I have done it.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I was working on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
But these "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."

<seg id="57">
With the introduction of characters, the British black culture, both as celebrated, Henry worked in the 1980s in an alternative comedy circuit.

</seg>
<seg id="63">
I had never been properly at school learned something about him and kept him mostly for a domain of middle-class whites in tights and a cabbage front.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
So I had a great fear of it.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
All of us who interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, " you should try it.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Do it not bad, if you do not know what you are talking back.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Put a few of the words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
I had the feeling that I could do it.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
It was almost as if someone gave me the head finally set up properly.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
" This is what it is, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, your text, recherchiere a bit.

<seg id="72">

Not only is the BBC as a vast and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The trust works in two directions: inward to the first Guard's own management hierarchy at the BBC, but also externally as the voice of public concern and unrest, if things go wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which requires a full comprehensive reform.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But the new incoming chairman would risk, to everything and an institution, which is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he himself perhaps brings to his job.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is a difficult task.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And as if that were not enough, are also still many interested to see the BBC reduced overtaken - power, money and status.

<seg id="17">
While the competition approaches and new technologies threaten the old, comfortable certainties, the forthcoming negotiations of license fees for the BBC with special dangers.

<seg id="18">
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year, is buying the British public in certainly the world's largest media company.

The BBC tells a good story: she says that she achieved 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.

And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale upwards: 53 percent support them today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.

Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both were absent in the spirit of the console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news than the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Your feet are too big.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Because of their very own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Not banned - nothing was forbidden - just not played.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It has been successfully obsolesziert, just as the word obsoleszieren.

The general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how the people in books choose From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and love novels, they chose the music of the ballads.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern an imaginary piano to play and sing in a gross-weird Serenade Ailinns big feet.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Ailinn did not understand that.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"It was a well-known song, a jazz pianist called fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
His father had always done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
His father had played it with his own father, he was told.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
If you start off with a word with a J, without two finger over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
It was not a very fun game, and it was not very funny.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It had to explain what jazz was.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Ailinn had never heard any.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Jazz was, even though he was not directly, not banned.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The improvisation was no longer fashionable.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
There was only room for one "if" in life.
</seg>

And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.

<seg id="39">
Although he was 10 years old, without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, knew Kevern something about jazz in the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
</seg>

But at least he had to explain Ailinn, fats Waller was black.

Since they had only heard ballads, it fell to Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words Kevern she had just vorgesungen could be set to music.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Music was an expression of love.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
"That is not really offensive," said Kevern.

Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
</seg>

They already thought he was a little odd.

"It was funny," he said instead.

So your feet do not directly.

<seg id="80">
If he was trying to be funny, he was often in trouble because he, like his father did not have the soothing charm that you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.

<seg id="81">
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.

<seg id="82">
Perhaps he wanted to be, Kevern.

Despite its friendly eyes.

In her excitement, she seemed to tremble as palms in the storm.

They knutschen - Knutschen was the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - it knutschen and then beat.
</seg>
<seg id="97">
It was an unnecessary refinement to Keverns view, since the Knutschen itself was an act of violence.
</seg>
<seg id="98">
Ailinn solo Mons gave him going through her body.
</seg>
<seg id="99">
He rose from the deck chair, like an old man.

Production in the euro zone on a 13-month low
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched study.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A figure over 50 indicates an expansion.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
New orders have fallen and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The figures prior to the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The markets expect the Bank to a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, during this week could provide such information, whether it is a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, are the deterrent impact of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.

The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months, with 51.4.

In the meantime, fell in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI to 46.9.

France remains a concern, as well as the descent of Italy of a solid expansion to stagnation.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany and in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are also not reassuring, " said Mr Dobson.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The decline in the industry is fueling the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Good news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August, is that the sector continues to grow."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He added: " producers in the eurozone's life are obviously very difficult, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine, uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries.

This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, in particular, and consumer confidence, and probably means that some orders are being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large orders.

The boy, who fled the bullets, believing that his mother was dead
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It was his first day of school (Russians go to the school) for 7 years and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother, Tamara.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
As a seven-year-old, he said, "mama told me that I should lie down, if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
She said to him: "run."
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and was on the way a toddler wines, it took in the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
His father, Vladimir, his son outside in the arms, said, " Damir told me that his mother had died.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
He said: "I could not save them."
</seg>
<seg id="44">
In fact, was Tamara stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, in the belief that her son died.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
After its reunification, she said: " I wept with joy.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
I could not believe it.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
He ran in and hugged me.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded newspaper News of the World) to get the title of Barnardo's, Children's Champion by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
"This horror you every day, but I wish I could stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
But I can say that it is in my memory.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
I remember that I am directly after all my toy guns wegwarf.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes, and that is no problem for me.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
" I am not afraid to go back into the gym, but I do not think about myself.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the yard, and they have not managed to get out.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
We never say that they were killed or are dead.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
We are saying that they remained in the sports hall.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
I remember very well my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
But now he has suffered anxiety to place such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
You followed this horror every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"I am so sorry for all those who suffer the atrocities," said Damir, who last week worked as a volunteer in a monastery.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
I am so happy to help.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
One day I will go to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the training academy.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: " 37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?
</seg>
<seg id="64">
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children, and run around, and the silence lasted for many months.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
She can still vividly recall their trip to London with Damir.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
The people of London, when I told our story.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
At the time, I understood how people understand our feelings on the other side of the world, and to show their support.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
I wish I could ring Cherie and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting me, her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and helped me.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all of the local Russian restaurants.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
I remember when he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot with his water gun on her and she ran away and played with him.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
And that was just a month after the horror.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
I was surprised that the British are so willing to share our pain and supported us.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
She said: " I always think that the world has not improved in those 10 years.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
In Ukraine, there is a war now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and still be killed.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
These are precisely such as our children.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
I think that for many of the war, some of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
I know just what these people feel, all the horror.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
And I can't stop it.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
When he was small, he suffered - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, his face away from us, for hours.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
I also remember how he threw all of its weapons and other military toys, Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
I can hardly believe that I was a few hours so sure that he is dead and that I would never see him again.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
When I recovered after the explosion and was on its feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with around the body parts.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could possibly have survived in this hell.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
" I remember that I shouted at him, " Damir, Run, Run away, " but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
But he has heard it and he ran away.
</seg>
<seg id="92">
And so is the life, unlike that of many others, for us.

Consolation: the Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother, Fatima, after the siege in 2004, right, a picture of Georgy today
</seg>
<seg id="96">
His blutüberströmtes face was scarred by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
</seg>
<seg id="97">
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
</seg>
<seg id="98">
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had sacked him for his first day of school before she ran in her older son Vladimir to the university.
</seg>
<seg id="99">
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and then my little boy remained there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.
</seg>
<seg id="100">
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives, but they were all killed.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
My Georgy only managed to survive.
</seg>
<seg id="102">
As the date draws nearer, the harder it is to remember and talk about it.
</seg>
<seg id="103">
There is no single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
</seg>
<seg id="104">
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days myself.
</seg>
<seg id="105">
No one will ever forget it, I promise you that.
</seg>
<seg id="106">
Urgent: the image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized (right) as the statue.
</seg>
<seg id="107">
I remember that Georgy on that day was so keen to go to school, he said that he wanted to hug his trainer.
</seg>
<seg id="108">
I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.
</seg>
<seg id="109">
And now there is even this statue of a weeping Georgy in San Marino.
</seg>
<seg id="110">
Georgy does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
</seg>
<seg id="111">
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world to feel our pain, thanks to this image.
</seg>
<seg id="112">
Georgy said today: " it is important that such a thing can never happen again.

<seg id="113">
" I doubt that we will ever know the truth.

<seg id="114">
Investigate the people keep such tragedies and never know the truth.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
And now they investigate the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="116">
Will we ever know what caused it?
</seg>
<seg id="117">
This world is becoming a little horror.
</seg>
<seg id="118">
" I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
</seg>
<seg id="119">
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
</seg>
<seg id="120">
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
</seg>
<seg id="121">
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
</seg>
<seg id="122">
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but by then it was better.
</seg>
<seg id="123">
I went back later in the year 2004 to school and I had every day fear.
</seg>
<seg id="124">
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.
</seg>
<seg id="125">
That is why I am always in the sports hall when the 1 September gets closer.
</seg>
<seg id="126">
I want to pay tribute to my my old childhood friends.
</seg>
<seg id="127">
It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
</seg>
<seg id="128">
I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
</seg>
<seg id="129">
I am not going to forget it, but I am not bemitleide.

I have completed this year, the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.

I am going to be a heart surgeon.

My first choice was an education in the army.

<seg id="138">
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
</seg>
<seg id="139">
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.
</seg>
<seg id="140">
It is really a miracle that he was not killed.
</seg>
<seg id="141">
"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB, the intelligence officer, but could do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
</seg>
<seg id="142">
It is still with me, it is nothing that I have left behind me.
</seg>
<seg id="143">
Now I am older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I must say that that is not true.

<seg id="150">
My pain is enormous and I wear it every day with me.
</seg>
<seg id="151">
My friends know that I do not like to think or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.
</seg>
<seg id="152">
Physically I am fine.
</seg>
<seg id="153">
I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.
</seg>
<seg id="154">
But because of my health, I could not study at the secret service, the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
</seg>
<seg id="155">
I have my documents, including the medical and they replied that it was not possible.
</seg>
<seg id="156">
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.

<seg id="157">
I have already two years behind me.

<seg id="158">
He has been studying the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
</seg>
<seg id="159">
He said: " I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
</seg>
<seg id="160">
Children should not know about it and they should not suffer, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="161">
His mother, Marina, 42, said: " the pain never leaves me.

<seg id="162">
He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary is approaching.
</seg>
<seg id="163">
I will go to the celebrations of the commemoration.
</seg>
<seg id="164">
I know that Georgy will not go.
</seg>
<seg id="165">
There is much more violent for him because he was there and I do not.
</seg>
<seg id="166">
I waited at home for him and could not help.
</seg>
<seg id="167">
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, all of them are painted in Beslan.
</seg>
<seg id="168">
It is in us.
</seg>
<seg id="169">
Georgy is now an adult, but the horror is still in it.
</seg>
<seg id="170">
It is hard to accept that if something is so Unfaires happened to her.
</seg>
<seg id="171">
He is a boy, he loves sports, but he cannot attend because of his knee.
</seg>
<seg id="172">
He was operated on several times, he can run, but not to participate in sport.
</seg>
<seg id="173">
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never be entirely overcome that and forget.
</seg>
<seg id="174">
This terrible experience will haunt us forever.
</seg>
<seg id="175">
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and this only reinforces my pain.
</seg>
<seg id="176">
I have lost many of the people I knew well and who were dear to me.
</seg>
<seg id="177">
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God gave me, but my heart cries for the killing.
</seg>
<seg id="178">
I know of families where children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
</seg>
<seg id="179">
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want that.
</seg>
<seg id="180">
I will never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="181">
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
</seg>
<seg id="182">
What these people are fighting for?
</seg>
<seg id="183">
Why they kill each other?
</seg>
<seg id="184">
The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.
</seg>
<seg id="185">
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
</seg>
<seg id="186">
People are suffering and children, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine have been killed and many more.

If we could only throw all these rebels and - as far away as possible.

The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
</seg>
<seg id="193">
The terrorists did they go, but kept their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister, Kristina and her brother Makhar in their cruelty in the school sports hall.
</seg>
<seg id="194">
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.

Her father, Ruslan has since married again and with his new wife Svetlana, a little girl that he had called after his lost daughter Kristina.

Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbours.

<seg id="197">
"Now they are a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.

Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories with the tenth anniversary.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
</seg>
<seg id="2">
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action-cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for about $300.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
I have these photos in a family with several cameras, which are all available at a price of less than $350.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Check your equipment twice.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other subjects are locked.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to take.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Some cameras and camcorders have scenes and recording modes, which optimizes exposure for the twilight these quickly underwater conditions.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
And before you jump into it, you look up in the depth of your equipment is functional.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Some cameras are only permitted for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Are you looking for in our shopping guides and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Take multiple shots - because many of them will not work.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCD, with which you can compose images, action-Cams normally does not.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the correct attitude is a matter of luck.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
So you make many shots.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If your camera has a terraced mode, with a series of recordings with slightly different exposure settings, you use it.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Stay near the surface.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
If possible, you remain so close to the surface, when you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
You can also be more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you see color.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Go close to the objects.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the bad lighting conditions.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
It is especially important if you are working with an action-cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have dense to your objects, if they are to fill the entire picture.

But mesothelioma is different.

In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber construction, which was once seen as a "miracle material" but has now been recognized as lethal.

For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore.

Asbestos is a product of the past.

The most dangerous use has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily to use it.

Even where it was used, only people working in certain sectors directly with the substance, plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.

<seg id="24">
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, he seems to be little concern.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
But such complacency is misplaced.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Britain, it seems, is enjoying the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.

<seg id="30">
The reason why we now see the deadly effects, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999, banned all types of asbestos), is that a mesothelioma emerged only after decades.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Asbestos was, and is often still exist in the houses, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we buy.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions and age.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected area.

Andrew Lawson was not old.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
He was also not a plumber.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
It was indeed hard to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Then he found out.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"It looks as if, in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I was six years of my education, a lot of asbestos." He wrote.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and guard - use the tunnel.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
One wonders how many of my contemporaries suffer from the same disease?
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question, at least in part.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and the diseased in mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one is still alive."

Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to be stalling, 90000 of the disease will be a victim.

She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible on the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years when she began her career at M &amp; S.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Now she has two children in their twenties.

<seg id="61">
" Before this, " she says, " I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.

<seg id="62">
I never thought that I would get this.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Three of the six were used in construction.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos is now by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
It has been used for roof panels, floor plates, Rohrisolationen, boilers, insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with potential casualties.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
However, more dangerous is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Britain was once the world's biggest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high rates of mesothelioma."

He has presented a study of the stakeholders in the argument that "a significant proportion of the Mesotheliome without known suspension was caused by work or in the home, presumably by asbestos contact in the environment."
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Most of these contacts, his words, based on the "normal use and aging" of our building.

<seg id="76">
It appears that no one could expect to be safe.

A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government, have been unwittingly exposed to the substance might be.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Goddard, 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipelines were contaminated with asbestos behind the committee rooms of the Parliament, whose lethal fibres could be something as harmless as "strong air movements".
</seg>
<seg id="79">
Parliament members are often accused of looking after their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
While the principals of the Parliamentary work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace received a "clean health certificate," it is now clear that £ 1 billion of work has to be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernise the electrical installations, and to remove the asbestos, and that the MPs after the general election in 2015 will take rather in nearby QE2 Conference Centre on the green benches at Westminster.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations."
</seg>
<seg id="82">
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
Everything you can do now is wait.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
A person who could never determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
As Andrew Lawson believed the 50-year-old Abbott, that he was during his work in hospitals exposed to asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
" I have worked in a hospital, where asbestos claims have been decidedly positive, " he says, " but I can't prove it in my case.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
It is so difficult to remember all the places where they worked and the data.

<seg id="92">

</seg>
<seg id="93">

</seg>
<seg id="94">
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain from the chest skin, the skin around his lungs.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
But as Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
</seg>
<seg id="96">
He went a month not to work.
</seg>
<seg id="97">
Verwunderte doctors made X-ray pictures of his chest and put Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the lab.
</seg>
<seg id="98">
His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.
</seg>
<seg id="99">
His health has slowly improved, and he returned to his job.
</seg>
<seg id="100">
From time to time, the symptoms returned, however, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
In 2011, Abbott's was a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
</seg>
<seg id="102">
But even now, Abbott is not with his own case.
</seg>
<seg id="103">
Finally, his patient was several decades older, and had worked directly with asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="104">
The connection in the case was clear.
</seg>
<seg id="105">
In September 2011, Abbott's deteriorated state and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray photographs of a group of experts.
</seg>
<seg id="106">
In December 2011, two years after Abbott was ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the ribs and chest fur.

Only now he realised the extent of the epidemic.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in large public buildings, where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="116">
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now ill.

And so mesothelioma is younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.

The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
</seg>
<seg id="119">
But many employees who came in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another alternated (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate (as Graham Abbott often did), most likely in contact with the toxic substances.

It also applies to schools.

Indeed, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.

And you gave me about 12 months.

Mesothelioma is a particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself - that is causing the deadly cancer.
</seg>
<seg id="147">
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="148">
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
</seg>
<seg id="149">
If the tremors of asbestos and the fibres are inhaled, they can fix the breast skin, the skin around the lungs.
</seg>
<seg id="150">
Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin cells and can cause mutations.
</seg>
<seg id="151">
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax-doctor moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="152">
It is the hospital of the Andrew Lawson believed that it was exposed to asbestos, it is now, ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
</seg>
<seg id="153">
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely during their training in hospital exposed to asbestos.
</seg>
<seg id="154">
Once the asbestos needles the lung tissue, says Treasure, " they will be pushed to the edge of the breathing process, where the skin is.
</seg>
<seg id="155">
Inherently it is invasive right from the start.
</seg>
<seg id="156">
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well for mesothelioma.
</seg>
<seg id="157">
The effectiveness of the operation, for example, is hotly disputed.
</seg>
<seg id="158">
Some say that it was worth a try.
</seg>
<seg id="159">

"You can't cut out the chest hairs," he says.

They are not concerned with the knife.
</seg>
<seg id="162">
Meanwhile, the cancer "is not very well to chemotherapy," the "effect", but not cures.
</seg>
<seg id="163">
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
</seg>
<seg id="164">
But in the end they all die.
</seg>
<seg id="165">
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.

The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
</seg>
<seg id="167">
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fighting.
</seg>
<seg id="168">
After he had mesothelioma contacted Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis was a one-man support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.
</seg>
<seg id="169">
"Hello, cancer," he was merrily on calls.
</seg>
<seg id="170">
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
</seg>
<seg id="171">
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
</seg>
<seg id="172">
Abbott originally been offered to six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life expected just a month.
</seg>
<seg id="173">
"I was desperate," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="174">
I wanted to give up.
</seg>
<seg id="175">
Lawson, however, was "to make things in a more positive light."
</seg>
<seg id="176">
Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy's.
</seg>
<seg id="177">
"We had an advantage that I had to be referred, I phoned up and got an appointment," admits Graham.
</seg>
<seg id="178">
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and must wait for the approval of the treatment.
</seg>
<seg id="179">
Money is crucial for mesothelioma-sufferers to be able to play the best available therapies.
</seg>
<seg id="180">
But if these treatments eventually inevitably fail, there are many people from another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
</seg>
<seg id="181">
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
</seg>
<seg id="182">
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
</seg>
<seg id="183">
"It has been known since 1898, that asbestos is extremely dangerous for health," says Morgan.
</seg>
<seg id="184">
But what has changed in the 1960s that it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
</seg>
<seg id="185">
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
</seg>
<seg id="186">
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, and in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls "full compensation" as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
</seg>
<seg id="187">
After the investigation, confirmed his death, a spokesman of the Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement."
</seg>
<seg id="188">
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
</seg>
<seg id="189">
How asbestos can be removed
</seg>
<seg id="190">
In fact, it is for mesothelioma-sufferers, seeking compensation, it is a huge problem, the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job, usually decades after the incidents.
</seg>
<seg id="191">
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
</seg>
<seg id="192">
Insurance documents can be lost.
</seg>
<seg id="193">
And those who resist claims to know that it is time for them, but certainly not in line with the prosecutor.
</seg>
<seg id="194">
In response, there were major new laws, it is easier for mesothelioma-affected, compensation for this, even if their former employers are no longer detectable in this year.
</seg>
<seg id="195">
The law has a fund sponsored by the insurance industry £ 350 million for all those diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but no one can sue.
</seg>
<seg id="196">
In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them could grant - about £ 120000.
</seg>
<seg id="197">
About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.
</seg>
<seg id="198">
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma-affected that £ 350 million is a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
</seg>
<seg id="199">
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay when the time would not have been able to overcome it and mesothelioma-PLD companies and they could sue.
</seg>
<seg id="200">
Also, Mike Penning, the former work and pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
</seg>
<seg id="201">
But both Penning as Morgan acknowledged that rapid action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day.
</seg>
<seg id="202">
"The people are suffering so much and now need help," said Penning during the second hearing of mesothelioma Act in December of last year.
</seg>
<seg id="203">
At this point was Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
</seg>
<seg id="204">
After her first consultation recommended long-Lazdunski surgery, which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
</seg>
<seg id="205">
This has been accompanied by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with a survival rate of long-Lazdunski over five years by up to 40 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="206">
Abbott felt strengthened.
</seg>
<seg id="207">
"This is, of course, with the most important thing," says Abbott.
</seg>
<seg id="208">
This is apparent in patients.
</seg>
<seg id="209">
There is something that you can move on.
</seg>
<seg id="210">
If you aufgibst, you very quickly deteriorate.
</seg>
<seg id="211">
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="212">
At the end of August, he had the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
</seg>
<seg id="213">
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
</seg>
<seg id="214">
Then I had in March 2014 a scan.
</seg>
<seg id="215">
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
</seg>
<seg id="216">

This is not life-threatening.

Hong Kong, China denied the right to choose government protesters swear vengeance
</seg>
<seg id="2">
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections by 2017, the Hong Kong electorate.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This approach probably fired long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists planning and mobilization to within a few hours after the announcement began.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows basically Communist leaders reject all candidates loyal to Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
That is not what Beijing had promised.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In his defense of the Chinese decision, said Li Fei, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the approval of public nominations for the elections for the Hong Kong government to "chaotic".
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Since 1997, when Britain created the control over Hong Kong, the Chinese, Beijing has promised that the inhabitants in 2017 to choose the presidency of government.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The Chinese leadership's decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it is the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also demonstrates that the Chinese leadership, the process by a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing firmly in the hands.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
After a new clause should be allowed to be the only candidate "with a love of country and love Hong Kong".
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most efficient public protests in Hong Kong took place for a number of years.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district, if Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
On Sunday evening had gathered within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central's supporters in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest planned in the coming weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
They did not give details, however, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In an online statement, the organizers disclosed that the movement has " the occupation of the central district of only as a last resort taken into account, an action which would only take place if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
We are sorry to have to say today that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the announcement of Beijing for days, and were on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures, including police and barricades.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The influx of people from the mainland increased the competition for products and services.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Moreover, there is growing fear that the values of Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"The protests, which they could talk to a lot of economic harm, depending on how many are involved and how long they continue," said legal expert Regine Ip, which has long been critical of the movement.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
We do not want to stoke fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This impression is bad for investment.
</seg>

Feminists criticising race and police conduct after Ferguson
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month of a police officer in Ferguson, Mon genau.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The participants raised their hands in the air and chanting, "hands high, do not shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez, a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After their experience, white feminist commentators sex before the race, when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But while the increased tensions in the Midwest and received nationwide attention, saw Perez that the responses of white women revolved around the race to 100%.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots came from 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But Perez was an important change.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I do not think that feminism is many people who talk about the white and privileges on such high-class way," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
People were urged to express something about the incidents.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is characteristic of the crisis we are facing and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized is that they need to express it.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell Ferguson problems brought to light by black American women every day, but they are not regarded as "women's issues" in the cultural area.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get 150 likes will from anywhere," said Mitchell.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
If I post something about how colours in their own country are under siege, the silence is deafening.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not on safety in public spaces?" She asked.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
For black women like Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the issues of clean; they live every day in the combined reality.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, says Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and Gender Studies at the George Mason University that their predecessors did the opposite.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"Between 1865 and 1890 were lynched at least 10000 black men and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
White women have had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For Hattery came the chasm between white and black women could be at the point where white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony, the country in the late years of the 19th century, analyzed and discovered that the fight for the right to vote only for one group: women or blacks.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"They took the decision to campaign for women's suffrage and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
When you think of such things, is a white women do not trust with power aware why coloured women.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
We have not done our job well.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Even after women the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women against the Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organised.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The group was established nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - a reflection of the time, in which white feminists "catch" with the problems, with black women for generations.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists with such traditional feminist platforms, the right to education of a child as seriously as they do with the right to birth control?" Asked Mitchell.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Feminists of the second generation, which built their careers on the battle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, and try to understand what that means.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian pundit, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the issue of racism.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on the race, which are different in public opinion polls - the changes," Steinem wrote.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, racial and gender issues, some are puzzled by their comments on the racial issue in America.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Christina summer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of Who Stole Feminism? " Said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, " are far more vulnerable than their sisters, " but Steinems comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their earlier criticism.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But as the White House recently, a small program, My Brother's Keeper, worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were infuriating reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem is that in the forefront of mainstream feminism.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
After the US border police has almost 63000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year, is also the issue of immigration reform back to the surface - this time as a women's issue.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important issue for women only, they should publish the stories of immigrant women.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
If the vast majority of the work visas of male immigrants, are the women who accompany them in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.

The tax burden of business people in the Washington area is rising with economic recovery
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A recovery of the economy means more customers and more sales and new jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It also means higher taxes.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the accelerated economic recovery, a new study published last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Companies in the region District, Maryland and Virginia, jointly paid $27.6 billion in state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The state and local tax burden of the company rose by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining Opinions in 2009 and 2010.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
State taxes rose to more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the Center for National tax, a tax policy group of the Services agency Ernst &amp; Young.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
More than half the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue of Maryland from companies.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Virginia, with 28 percent, the lowest tax revenue from companies.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A large part of the increase in tax revenues is in a recovery of the real-estate values of the companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase in real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
While a large proportion of these profits from large states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be for the Washington area.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But the apparent recovery in the real-estate values is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue in Maryland, as the real estate taxes to barely more than a fifth of the amount of tax decisions of companies.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"In Maryland is the following: a large proportion of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.

Maryland is therefore forced to rely, for example, more on income taxes, in order to offer the same services that other countries.

<seg id="17">
The recent recovery in tax revenues from companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Corporate earnings also appear to recover, the data.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations from $2.3 billion, compared with 2.1 billion in 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Maryland took a $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
While the trend is heading in the same direction, rising evenly to the local tax burden on companies is not at all three locations.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The Anstiegsrate in the District was at 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Only Virginia, reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Virginia, with 6 percent in all three areas of the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The corporate tax rate in Maryland stands at 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local corporate taxes and generally a better tax climate than in Maryland.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In the study of the District was not investigated.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Despite the advantages of Virginia, is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
If the state continues its revenue targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state of up to 3% by 2017.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In the meantime, it seems better to go to small businesses in the Washington area, and so they pay more state and local taxes, so the recent study.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Corporate taxes paid by small business and personal income taxes - a transitional structure, organized according to the most small businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a sharp faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes in the country are likely to persist this year, with an increase in the general VAT revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014, compared with the same period of the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
However, the region could lag behind Washington, if the spending cut in the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region.

Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Frankfurt's sister city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of officials in China.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"We would be delighted if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the deputy party secretary of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Again and again, the leader of the ruling Communist Party of China in the course of the conversation to this concern, the 12-million metropolis.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Guangzhou, also known as Canton, in Germany, is one of the richest cities of China, Li was canvassing.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Therefore, the people who have purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German politician delegation, said the host, he would hear in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"For beer, it does not take much: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at a lunch with the party upper in Guangzhou.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The joy of life strahle Mr Li, he flattered the hosts.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Then came the functionary from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served at dinner.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Chinese brand Tsingtao traces back to German brewing beer.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
More business transactions
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy leader Li.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The Lufthansa flight had offered earlier, but cancelled in 2012 due to economic reasons.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"It would be worth", were convinced the local politicians.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"The business connections between our two cities increasingly."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Currently, travelers have to detour via Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Also, the administration of Guangdong province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hopes for the flight.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, this wish during his meeting with the Social Democrats.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"This is a very good idea," said Shepherd-Gümbel - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, nodded approvingly.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Neat partnership
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The leutselige deputy party chief of Guangzhou hopes that he can visit Frankfurt a partnership next year.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Li Yiwei, was already on Main, but not yet in office.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Also, the local party chief Wan Qinglian had to go.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and the administration, which is enforced by the hardness of leader Xi Jinping.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The new leaders, Li Yiwei had worked against his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Before he took office in Guangzhou, he was a top official in Fujian, where the automakers VW built a magnum opus.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Frankfurt is officially received more than a dozen town-twinning.

Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Amazon has just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The announcement is a surprise, not because nobody had expected an acquisition of Twitch, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Three months ago, it looked as though the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion, and the cooperation was also, of course.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, "a YouTube for live games," says an insider.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Twitch interface.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
And "let us play," a video genre, a painting of secret science theatre in salving the (usually older) games, are already very popular on YouTube.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The fact is that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube would buy Twitch, a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is a mystery as to why the deal with YouTube was not derailed, because the company is reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Everything we know about at the moment, this statement is Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "we chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get there faster."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Am going to like me, who say that they prefer to play sports as a watch, it is hard to understand the attraction, which assumes that watching other games to even the control console.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It is one thing, a friend at 3.00 a.m. to look over the shoulder, while it creeps through Resident Evil, and quite another to a spinner poke it 20 times in succession in Call of Duty is shot in the head.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
You could just look at all these games.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so it can be to watch it without its own control over the prospect of a good recipe for headaches.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
I admit that the quick passes, the Roger Bannisters in our electronic age whole games in record time, entertaining.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But as long as not a game or humor virtuoso is his Twitch channel is probably not as interesting.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
But what skeptics know as I have of it?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Twitch is called 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video is integrated, such as YouTube, Twitch would have simply swallow.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
But Twitch has something any company would like: thousands of young men who are courted as advertisers.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said that Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of a contraction, not yet - schluck - as a spectator sport.

On the bouncy castle at the castle garden, had a lot on Saturday.

<seg id="2">
The concept of the organisers.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Despite the strong Regengusses on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
At times had to be stopped at all.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.

</seg>
<seg id="7">
Two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Shem, the name of Amula.

Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden brightness radiate through various shows during the day and evening.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Oh, and the fun comes from anyway.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This became evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors to the open air journeys.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A feast for all generations, the organizers had promised.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And they have done it.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
It had Salzwedeler, but also guests from their immediate surroundings relaxing around the supply levels at the castle garden lawn.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They watched the first live performances, wippten with one foot to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And across the generations.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
While the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten, others raged at a quarter of wine in the wine labten, the young on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But even in the crafts of the volunteers had their hands full in the truest sense of the word, to the onslaught of spells and imaginative creations in the little faces.

Shortly before 5: 30.00 p.m. prasselte down to the visitors, especially families sought the vastness and dry.
</seg>

But the attraction of the festival did not diminish.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Therefore am a repeat of the major party in the coming year.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Although the event is still working on the content and size, Sem, in a first assessment on Sunday with the popular vote, made it clear.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
He described as annoying that the admission had to be stopped.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Obviously, the security company has been booked with too little staff.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The result: some people who had already paid, were no longer on the site.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The response has been very good.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In a first tentative estimate said the Salzwedeler participates in about 1200 visitors who once thronged in the castle garden.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
There have been problems in the marriage.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks'n'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The technicians were not able to create a semi-reasonable tone.

<seg id="33">
The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents are not due to a puncture could be transferred to Salzwedel.
</seg>

"Next year, but they will be," according to the organizers.

<seg id="35">
The premiere of the Amula Open Airs was more than achieved by the number of visitors.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And in bad weather.

The castle clubs soon buddies again?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Finally, there has been disagreement between the two wolf Council Hauser castle.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Now the executives to think about a possible cooperation.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
As a model for the reconstruction of the wolf Council Hauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Council of Wolf Hauser castle friends, the project in the French Guédelon.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle of Wolfratshausen friends.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Seemed very different positions so far, as with the history of the wolf council houses and a possible reconstruction.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Now the two sides together: it should soon be held talks on a common approach.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This confirms the club executive Torsten Sjöberg (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (friends) to demand of our newspaper.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again," says Sjöberg.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
So are quicker to visible results.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
While the castle for the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath until the end of a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest in the eye, stands for the Association for Sjöberg ' unlocking and Erlebbarmachung " of the site.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle of friends, was very pleased by its own account of the call.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
He is the castle of friends since Dimbaths death.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Currently, the association, according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have the first association activities out of respect." This "theory" was needed to "consider how we might proceed."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
According to Piffl is the new chairman will be in the conversation with the club.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Meanwhile, the castle of friends could also make a current mood within their group.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A candidate for the presidency, there is not yet, says Piffl.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"But I am confident that someone will find" and he will not run because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The new chairman should be a wolf council houses.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The Tölz wants to continue to participate in the project "but very happy."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction in the eyes of Piffls seems to be in the near future.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
He praises Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France, would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
By a large number of the people, and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Piffl: " I was skeptical at the beginning.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Over time, but I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward. " It could be a " USP " for the Flößerstadt.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Here, there is nothing else.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In addition, the project by EU grants, coupons and potential sponsors would be financeable, believes Piffl.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"The idea of reconstruction, I personally do not throw away." He hoped that the castle club might move on this point.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Their goal is to document the story first, "is important and good."

Clever ways to save for university textbooks
</seg>
<seg id="2">
As the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 per year, pondered the fast second-semester student Matt Schroeder, a clever idea of austerity.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the re-sale.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"My maths book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The books needed for the last semester had cost him $430, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He gave $120.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The college management told the students, on average, more than $1200 per year for textbooks and study material that there were, however, various costs options for students.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Online stores and creative approaches as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The hiring of textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book a semester long, often at a much lower price than buying.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Polls in the industry, show that about one-quarter of the books in the college bookstores was hired last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Less than half of all books bought in campus bookstores, according to the trade association, National Association of College Stores.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Here is the ABC for the best deals.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Buy online
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Some new books online cost only one-third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The ninth edition of "Calculus" I will just describe how Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained at the specialized textbook retailers Chegg.com for 239.99 dollars.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Buy used
</seg>
<seg id="18">
If one of the notes or other normal tracks, used books are a good option.

Putin calls for the inclusion of Kiev "statehood talks" with the eastern Ukraine
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government to stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and directly to negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin had not meant that the territory under the control of the separatists in eastern Ukraine will be part of Russia, but that his status to Ukraine should be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region of the power of representation of its rights and interests.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Putin's appeal to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, fits the strategy pursued by him since the start of the riots five months ago, apparently: aid for the separatists in the adoption of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia with the West.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently taken the territory known as the "Novo Rossija" or "Neurussland", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the Ukrainian politicians, campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt. and while government groups to attack civilian communities in the rebel-held areas are hoping for early peace talks "are caught in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"We must immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organisation of society and the state status of the South-East of Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the wider autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The clarification of the Kremlin's spokesman on the correction of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Moscow would have far more difficulty to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys before the conflict, a broad majority in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The autonomy, which has been raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate trade agreements and foreign relations, and the Kremlin has de facto control of a territory that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The peninsula annexed five months ago in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, and an important trading port and historic coastal region.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, the major components for the Russian military.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - for new elections, amendments to the Constitution should bear in mind that the respective areas will be given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, arming and Moscow is accused of incitement.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Putin's last call on Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders, followed after another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks on the previously peaceful region invaded the eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup, according to the fears of Ukrainian security officials, the first step in a campaign for the takeover of the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations under way to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and a narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday and asked for urgent action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"We are now at a point where there is a point of no return," warned Poroshenko.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The EU summit decided to any concrete actions, the leaders demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of Ukraine crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian columns of tanks and 1000 soldiers invaded last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the beleaguered separatists, said Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were delivered by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk included, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers on Ukrainian territory captured a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
