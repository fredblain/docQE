<seg id="1">Recollection on the very American ideal of the labor laws as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The congressional representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a parliamentary bill, in order to establish the organization of trade unions as civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">“As trade unions, die also the middle class jobs die,” said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairmen progressive Caucus in the congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore I present the employee enabling act proudly together with the civil right icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative law gives the same legal possibilities to workers with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with other forms of discrimination - and stops so anti-into a union stopped forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of the national labor law law, in order to create a possibility for a discrimination suspended workers for the organization of a trade union agency to receive in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and around payment of damages or fines - is a meaningful and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is not with security a radical initiative - anyhow not after American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually the best way is to understand its that Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of its bill suggest, the connection back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">To expand and keep despite the setbacks, the trade unions were exposed to which in the past years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states generally speaking country - have Americans once countries in all world encouraged to recognize labor laws.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which millions of Americans still remember, when this country called democracy, free speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When after the Second World War Japan occupied the United States, it encouraged general Douglas Mac Arthur and its staff the country to adopt a condition which is to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full consciousness its that the workers and their trade unions took new Japan a role with the creation, used it a language, which recognized explicitly that “the rights of the workers to combination and common negotiating are guaranteed and acting.”</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupy Germany after the Second World War, Dwight David Eisenhower and its staff the Germans pushed general to write a condition which would ensure that fascism Adolf Hitlers was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In acknowledgment of the fact that the workers would have themselves to organize, and their voting in the new nation raise should, the Germans inserted a clause, which stated explicitly: “The right will improve to create combinations to secure around work and economic conditions and each particular and each profession or trade guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements, which limit this right or aim at, it to diminish are zero and futile; whereupon aiming at measures are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency over the international human rights commission, by which the universal declaration of human rights was sketched, as it was taken over 1948 of the United Nations as world-wide agreement, inserted Roosevelt and the other authors a warranty that “everyone has the right, to trade unions for the protection of its interests to form or them step.”</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations Americans accept the basic premise that labor laws are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country other countries advised how one could form civilian and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to the establishment of a trade union - and whereupon that this trade union may participate then in collective negotiations as equivalent partners with enterprises and government agencies - to be protected had.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights came in America under bombardment are it actually much point to lead itself the American ideal again before eyes therefore the working population the right to have must to unite and provide in a free and open society hearing.</seg>
<seg id="20">As minister said Martin Luther King Jr. before fifty years:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great instructor.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now all know the fact that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation but increased it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By the rise of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market for the industry in wondrous way and raised the entire nation to inconceivable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those, which attack the work, forget these simple truths, but history retains them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, and which we should also do.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal acknowledgment of the labor laws as human rights - and the extension of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination with the creation of representatives for the employees - is for a long time overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals, which made America in the past and which promises of democracy redeemed large.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge stops temporarily law that to the locking could force all abortion hospitals in Louisiana</seg>
<seg id="2">A US-Federal High Court Judge stopped the conversion of a law to Louisiana on Sunday provisionally, of whom lawyers said that it would have probably led to the locking of all five abortion hospitals of the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure, which was raised from Bobby Jindal, governor from Louisiana, in June to the law and on 1 September to go in effect was, would force physicians, who would drive through abortions, to it, to acquire a patient admission right with a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the judge means however that the physicians would drive through provisionally further legally abortions can, while they request such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">“The plaintiffs can continue working law-conformal, while they strive for the acquisition of these rights,” wrote Federal High Court Judges John deGravelles in its judgement.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within one month a hearing for the judge is set, in order to cause for the law a more permanent decision.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, which youngest in a set of judgements said against similar measures and that physicians would win so more time, in order to attain ill.</seg>
<seg id="8">“The today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a perfidious law, which wants to take their health and their rights to them” said Nancy Northup, Präsidentin and chairman of the center for reproduction rights, which had complained in the name of three of the five hospitals of the state, in order to stop the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not directly clear whether the judgement extended also to the physicians from the two hospitals, which had not followed the complaint and had not likewise requested briefing rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states, which issued similar laws, whereby courts explained recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the hospitals remained in the state to the locking, were stopped by a Federal High Court Judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion proponents and the American college OF Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as American Medical Association say agreeing that briefing rights require unnecessary restrictions of physicians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents hold out that the measures serve the protection of the health of the women, although some also the effects of a locking of hospitals welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one physician, who accomplishes abortions in Louisiana's, had patient A INSTRUCTION RIGHTs, communicated the center for reproduction rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all remaining physicians in the state are forced to accomplish no more abortions this physician became from fear around its security the operation any longer would not drive through, said the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">With their argumentation against the judgement representatives of the state said Louisiana that they would not punish physicians because of the execution of abortions, while their requests for patient instruction rights would be still pending.</seg>

<seg id="5">The research leader of RP DATA, Tim Lawless, communicated that Sydney and Melbourne propel a split market.</seg>

<seg id="2">The style of the university is not that, is called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus the family Medau was informed already “in the middle of June verbally about the unjustified demand of the university.</seg>
<seg id="4">The statement that only in July admits the plans became, are definitely wrongly”, like that Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time it refers to it that it does not concern with the plans “preliminary definitions or decisions”, it however “preferences” would give.</seg>
<seg id="6">Also the development of the narrow road to the lock, necessary for the approach road, is feared up less dramatically than of the Medaus.</seg>
<seg id="7">From nine meters spread road were and are not the speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Wide a meter goes than so far”, explains Pötzl to present conditions by 5.50 meters, that is.</seg>
<seg id="9">The argument of the Medau operators that their free and schoolown park surfaces are in the future then only used by students of the university, wants not to let Pötzl be valid.</seg>
<seg id="10">One does not park across at all, because as with other public parking lots meanwhile intelligently can be solved.</seg>

<seg id="12">The creche mountain dwarf, which is on the area and would lead before their doorstep the approach road to the parking deck along, is not to be impaired according to the university president “”.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather it gives to consider, “that it not only around the creche goes here, but also around the adjacents resident at the inlet to the Friedrich Streib road and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring six-form high school.</seg>
<seg id="14">It concerns thus much more than so around particularist interests of the Mr. Medau”, to Pötzl.</seg>
<seg id="15">Whether the criticism of the parents adviser of the creche, with which development of the road one “few nature-left marks the Coburgs to be lost” is entitled can decide “the reader”.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of Octobers wants Pötzl as well as the national board of works Bamberg the town councillors about the structural development of the university to 2020 to inform “and in this context the meaning of the new development address”.</seg>
<seg id="17">Peer Medau had informed past week parents of the creche about the plans of the university.</seg>
<seg id="18">Therefore the approach road for the new parking deck is to lead not as before across the campus and the Friedrich Streib road, but across the Medau mountain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thus the narrow road on approximately a kilometer of length would have to be removed two-lane.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to computer forecasts of the Medaus traffic in the park of lock high rock thereby would increase tenfold.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never took me into the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Has never said “I loves you”</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was from seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its father, who died, when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry rehearses rare records, which are partly based on an imaginary discussion with its father and developed from the series on radio 4 for a comedy, Rudy's.</seg>
<seg id="6">That soundtrack is a mixture from reggae and RAP, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work itself by some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">It visited “many” therapies after the death of its mother, and Henry is thoughtful over its relationship with its father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was heavy to know it.</seg>
<seg id="10">One never saw its face, heard only its voting: “Stop with the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move you!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to look Cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - which had already arisen, when I was a child - went with him into the tavern and spoke about things, like the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.</seg>
<seg id="15">I had never such a discussion with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A majority of my life it was this serious type in the corner, which the newspaper read.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of its father, he won nevertheless an insight of as the life for him might have been.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now somewhat brighter, but they are dark, stygische labyrinths smoke-filled and deep with flame impacts and smoke and much soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father put to hear in former times simply into the tub and then could one him slowly, how he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry of itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I ran around there, it became clear me that he had for many years done that, in order to bring the meal on the table, and my attention for him became larger.</seg>
<seg id="21">Henry buildup nevertheless as a child without love testifying of its parents.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he said never “I loves you”.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only as it to my mother toward end of their life badly went, began we, “I loves you, I loves you, I loves you” to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">By its own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could divide the love, which he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you times with “I love you” to stop?</seg>
<seg id="26">Stop nevertheless embracing me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I am 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">with Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why shouldn't we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still friendly with French, with which it was 25 years married.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is good humans.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why shouldn't we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henrys own mother was Diabetikerin.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to its death.</seg>
<seg id="37">As I thus very much, very overweight became and symptoms of diabetes showed, said my physician “you must be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">Thus I pulled this fitness thing through and had also a drastic diet to make, in order to turn around the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very heavy.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is arduous.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats gladly carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Perhaps Henrys career change shows up in its elegant, shortcut beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since it was praised by the critics for its Othello, he is taken in of the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">The comedy of the erring followed, and then Fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">That is another experience than the sitcom and comedies, which filled out its busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">It began with only 16 years, when he worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered it on the stage, as he people imitated and wrote new Faces over him.</seg>
<seg id="48">Its television career began in the middle of the seventies. “I was for a rather long time the only black Imitator/comedian on TV.”</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I did not only have to become large before the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 to learn, how I could become an efficient joke telling machine, while I was by the television a star, and that was really with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 with new Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">Since its manager possessed the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel show, an easy entertainment program, in which the people painted themselves “black”, specified Henry its Comedy there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family was very unpleasant that.</seg>
<seg id="54">I wished somehow that it would have never happened, but I do not repent that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated in giant projects and learned, how one deals with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this “price-crowned light column for many years of the British television” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”</seg>
<seg id="57">By the introduction of figures, which lampooned and celebrated the British black culture both, Henry in the 80s worked on an alternative Comedykreis.</seg>
<seg id="58">The front row of Lenny Henry Show went 1984 on transmission, and into the 90s he was among other things as the kitchen boss Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series boss! admits.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertisement, documentary films, TV-series and roles coined its next decade, but after its BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 it imagined: “Which you make next, Len, because it feels in such a way everything, as if bring you only the time rum or step a little on the place.”</seg>
<seg id="60">Afterwards a documentary series came in such a way for radio 4 with the title What's Great About…?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first consequence turned around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">On Shakespeare was I proper allergically.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had learned and regarded at school never correctly something over him him predominantly as a domain of the middle class, white one in thights and a cabbage in front in it.</seg>
<seg id="64">Thus I had large fear before it.</seg>
<seg id="65">All, which we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said “you should it times try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Do not make it bad, if you do not know, about which you talk.</seg>
<seg id="67">Take a few words into the mouth, and then you will understand, why we love all Shakespeare in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry specified 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary film and it was enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could create that.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was nearly, as if someone would have put the head finally correct to me on.</seg>
<seg id="71">“Around it, it goes is a serious thing, takes it seriously, learns your text, investigates a little.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months, before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and the happened simply not.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon it arose in the comedy of the erring.</seg>
<seg id="76">I in the national theatre and I were sudden could it hardly believe.</seg>
<seg id="77">There there was one moment, when I thought, “Oh, you changed. ""</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctive that he had to maintain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">“A small voice told me “you must now 10 minutes bridge, while they repair the computer. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead the stage leader announced that the conception would continue, as soon as the problem was solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said “Oh, thank God”.</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for it.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave that someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">“You plays in a play, therefore remain in your role.”</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">The text for Fences to learn was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, strengthens the chords.</seg>
<seg id="88">Also arrived well, it is thus like a large sign of the Gods, me say “that is your regulation here. ""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, naturally, with a THUNDERING voting.</seg>
<seg id="90">Thus I remain thereby.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love that.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love it to be in a sample area.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry has however still the head a comedian - our discussion is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while it imitates people again and again.</seg>
<seg id="94">I decided to make no condition UP Comedy because I find that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall of full strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If one looks for that all the time, one drives thereby before a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I arise sometimes live in the Apollo, if I have in addition desire, but altogether give not so much it to me like in former times.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask it whether he will make ever again a stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">That joke, which I have a beginning in an area with a director, who helps thereby, to form a center section and the end of a travel - I do not believe that I would like to ever again give up.</seg>
<seg id="99">Is that here thus its new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think already.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am gladly an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It makes joke.</seg>

<seg id="2">44 years was it in the school service, of it 23 as a head master.</seg>
<seg id="3">From this time Manfred Richter knows many stood Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a pupil.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its methods were sometimes unconventionally, but always carried from its striving to see in the pupil humans.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Schneekoppe is the most well-known mountain of the giant mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his homeland.</seg>
<seg id="7">Judge was born 1930 in cozy outer/north Bohemia, today Trutnov.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already with 14 it was interested after four years high school in the teacher profession.</seg>
<seg id="9">One year after the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a half hour the family had to leave their house.</seg>
<seg id="11">After some months in a camp it went 1946 to Bavaria - in the goods railroad car.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus it led to end up judges in the upper-Frankish lowering village.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher formation took place in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition Manfred Richter had to run six times per week of ten kilometers to the next station, drive with the course to Bamberg, go there three kilometers straight through the whole city to the school and in the evening back.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months Manfred Richter in a red cross home in Bamberg got a sleep opportunity: together with up to 15 schoolmates in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">it made first and 1954 for 1951 after three years teaching profession candidate the second state examination.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since Upper Franconia for it did not have a free position for teachers, it applied to Upper Bavaria and came themselves on 1 November 1954 to the school into Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The “Ms room” was its first “official residence” in the school building.</seg>
<seg id="19">1958 it referred a three-room official residence in the newly built teacher house beside the school.</seg>
<seg id="20">This house bought Manfred Richter 1980, after the school in Kollbach had been dissolved 1968.</seg>
<seg id="21">By then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school federation Petershausen Kollbach and in Peter living five.</seg>
<seg id="22">Starting from the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Peter living in the today's city hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the school federation Indian village was created, only the primary school remained in the place.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to escape a demotion in the smaller school, the rector at that time Georg Sigl changed to Karl field - and Manfred Richter became its successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Peter living grew, and so the children and their teachers could refer the today's building, which was extended 1997 after judge retirement starting from September 1982.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the mayor at that time Ludwig Götz, who let a work area build at community costs additionally and with the extension of 1997 cellar areas, although after the guidelines for school's buildings eligible for subsidy was not.</seg>
<seg id="27">“Mayor Götz was very schoolfriendly”, remembered judges gratefully.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his whole career Manfred Richter never forgot the speech contribution of a government representative, who had answered to a paper of a school advice on right and justice: “One may never forget the love”. Manfred Richter converted, which he had heard there as young teachers.</seg>
<seg id="29">“One must give two different kinds to the children: ”, The today 84-year old says roots and wings.</seg>
<seg id="30">And it had to experience: “Does not succeed always”. Whether he means only his pupils or exactly the same his own six children there, is not completely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In each case was judge doing sometimes unconventionally.</seg>
<seg id="32">If pupils flogged themselves, they got a punishing work from it not and also not for being kept in after school were condemned.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the community judge two pair boxing gloves had let purchase and let the two contractors begin against each other, even if there should be thereby times a violet.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the well-being of the school judge maintained a good relationship to the mayor at that time Ludwig Götz (CSU) as a rector.</seg>
<seg id="35">This induced the non-party judge after its retirement to stand as a candidate 1996 at least as last on the CSU list for the local council.</seg>
<seg id="36">But judge was preselected at place six and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="11">The BBC does not only stand as enormous and complex unit in the heart of the public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The confidence acts in two directions: inward on the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, in addition, outward as voice of public concern and unrest, if the things run wrongly.</seg>
<seg id="13">That provides for a nearly untenable duopoly, which requires for a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>

<seg id="17">While the competition moves more near and old, comfortable collateral threatens new technologies, the lining up negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of 145,50 £ per year the British public buys itself into the surely largest media company of the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tell a good story: she says that she reaches 96 percent of all households and to everyone of it only 40 pence per day costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently the BBC rises again upward on the popularity scale: They support 53 percent today, compared with 31 percent before 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="36">Likewise the understanding.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability made humans nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was in music expressed understanding.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although it had become 10 years old, without of Sammy Davis Junior to have heard, Kevern knew somewhat about jazz of the half secret collection of old CDs of its father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least it did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At its age it could not remember probably to a time, in which pop singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again was valid, no laws or obligations.</seg>
<seg id="43">A conformal society meant the fact that each element of this society agreed gratefully the principle of the group gift - gratefully as of the fate spared.</seg>
<seg id="44">Humans with afro Caribbean origin were suitable by temperament and figure for entertainment and sport, therefore and ran they sang.</seg>
<seg id="45">Humans, who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed as of nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task to guarantee that no family without functioning service telephone remained.</seg>
<seg id="46">Which still from the Polish community was remaining, worried about drains; which from the Greeks was remaining, plate smashed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country fast as WHICH HAPPENINGS WERE, IF IT WERE HAPPENING event from fear of fire stirring to be accused from fear even that the flames would consume them next had opened - Labneh and Shisha whistle restaurants, held themselves consider and became depressive with the inactivity.</seg>
<seg id="48">Everyone after its abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since it only ballads heard had, to understand fell it Ailinn heavily, how insulting words, which had sung Kevern it straight, set to music per become could.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">“Are not really insulting those,” said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for humans, whose feet are too large.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">It talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceitful feeling of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the sound absorption of the enormous Kohl-like sheets.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn did not understand yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have something so dear should?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a Jux, hesitated however, to put in their present again two fingers to the lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">It thought anyway already that he was somewhat strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">“It appeared to it hilariously,” said it instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">It shook disbelievingly its head and blocked Keverns view.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing else to see around the world, as its ungekämmtes jet-black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing that he would have wanted to see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="64">“If you it say,” my her without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But it does not explain yet why you sing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">It seemed honestly anxious.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too large?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so directly not.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps your ankles, a small little…</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say, you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">You hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Naturally I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That is nevertheless only the stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said “I loves you”, but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">“Your thick ankles are exactly the reason, why you please me,” he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am there a little perverted.</seg>
<seg id="78">That did not sound correctly.</seg>
<seg id="79">It should have been funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">If it tried to be funny he brought himself often in trouble, because he did not have like its father the reassuring Charm, which one needed, in order cruelty inherent in jokes to bezähmen.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps father wanted to be to be also cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps it, Kevern, wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite its friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from its beach chair, upset the console and buried the wine, which they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elder bloom wine, therefore was not drunkenness an apology for it.</seg>
<seg id="86">In its excitation it seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">“And your thick head is exactly the reason, why I feel perverted to you moved,” she said…</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am that not at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">She did suffering, both because of the unnecessary unkindliness of its words as well as the fear, to him who showed up in their eyes, when them revolted themselves against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did it think that he would strike her?</seg>
<seg id="91">It had not told it of the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he did not have doubts that it was essentially like that like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same enormous and ice-cold ocean broke here as there on the bank.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with still thicker skin and more morosely after the WHICH HAPPENING WAS than it their ancestors than smugglers and beach robber had been, pulled from tavern to tavern, always ready, the hand against a woman to raise, those them refused myself or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">Those would have shown it a thick fist, if them did not watch out!</seg>
<seg id="96">They only smooch - smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the insignificant love ballads from the console - it only smooch and then strike.</seg>
<seg id="97">After Keverns opinion was an unnecessary refinement, since smooching already represented an act of the force.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons gave to go to it through its body an indication.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the beach chair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">It felt likewise leaden, but the force of its mourning surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They nevertheless hardly knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">It watched it, as it departed - as of a room in the upper stick her companion it thereby watched - a man, weighted by somewhat, which he had caused.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, thought her.</seg>
<seg id="105">It felt a sudden pain for it and men generally, although some their hands had raised against her.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from it, its back bent, ashamedly, defeated, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight, which she seemed to know well, if she could not remember nevertheless only once, at which her something like that the today's day ago had already seen?</seg>
<seg id="107">When it again alone was, Ailinn Solomons looked on its feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Some years before straight told occurrences worked Esme Nussbaum, intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, which non-legislative monitoring device for the public tendency, at a short lecture on the continued force on low and middle level in exactly the regions, in which their decrease, if, earliest are had to be expected not abolishment, considering the funds and energy, which had been invested into the extermination of this force.</seg>
<seg id="109">“It was done already much, and much,” wrote it must be still done to appease “around the innate aggressiveness of a people who led thousand wars and won most of it, in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country, in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was felt rarely historically seen despite the high-rising steeples between the hedges.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some characteristics turn out as ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The more highly the steeple, then seems it, the smaller the passion, which it wakes further.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries when hearing sentimental ballads, inebriates themselves at stories over overcome difficulties and states to believe firmly in the virtues from marriage and family circle to but nevertheless only the earlier rawness does not keep the rural communities firm just like our urban structures in the hand, but there are also proofs for developing a new and perfidious contentiousness at home, on the job, on the roads and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">“You have a unfortunate tendency for exaggeration,” meant their mentor, when it had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read fewer novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: are you atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">“I believe, which I do not have to say,” answered to Esme Nussbaum.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme referred to its right to privacy and refusal of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">“I do not ask that,” said Luther Rabinowitz finally, “because I against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism would be.</seg>
<seg id="123">That is an impartial job here.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve an impartial society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, which are actually absolutely acceptable and praise worth, can distort occasionally results, as you presented it.</seg>
<seg id="126">They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things, which call you “perfidiously” and “roughly”, could be naturally interpreted of others just as well than expression of one strength and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If one continues to harp on on, WHICH HAPPENING IS, IF IT IS HAPPENING, as if it, if it had happened, would have happened yesterday, meant, to take to the country its substantial vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind its head a LED signature in flamingo-pink repeated the pieces of advice, which Ofnow had longer given to the country in the last quarter century or.</seg>
<seg id="130">If you smile at their neighbour, esteem their partner, hear you ballads, visit you musical, use you their telephone, speak you, explain you, listen you, agree you, apologize you.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speak is better as silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">“I understand absolutely, on which you want outside,” answered Esme Nussbaum with calm voting, when she was safe that its superior had in the end spoken, “and I said nothing else, that we did not heal yet so effectively, as we fool ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern lies in the fact that we regain us without preliminary warning possibly thereby as we repeat the errors, which ARE in the first place to the WHICH HAPPENING, IF IT IS HAPPENING led.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time there is however not the others, at which we vent our anger and our distrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to suggest thereby a patience of a saint.</seg>
<seg id="137">“You go too far,” said it, “if you to actions as “errors” to designate, which committed our grandparents perhaps or also not.</seg>
<seg id="138">They go also too far, if you speak of the fact that these would have vented their “anger” and it “distrust” at “others”.</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary actually to remind someone in your position of the fact that we with the understanding of the past as with the protection of the present, not of “us” and “others” to speak.</seg>
<seg id="140">There was none “we” and it gave no “different”.</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of the disorder, which is everything that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">“Of that, if we are honest to us, dared” Esme to throw in, “no part of the society to state can well to have behaved.</seg>
<seg id="143">I do not complain anybody on.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, is happened.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was at that time.</seg>
<seg id="146">In addition nothing more must be said - there are we us united.</seg>
<seg id="147">And exactly like no debt to be assigned must, then also no debt must be erased, if such a repayment were appropriate and if there were a way to erase it.</seg>
<seg id="148">But for which the past serves, if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past serves for the fact that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say to it something -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.</seg>
<seg id="152">“I will consider,” said and dismissed its report he her.</seg>

<seg id="2">Official representatives of the military in Lesotho denied a coup d'etat for the fall of the government to have planned and said that they proceeded against policemen, to who the armament of political fanatics is accused.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and communicated that the army of the country encircles its office domicile and Maseru occupied government buildings in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prime Minister brought his family into adjacent South Africa, after he had reported of assassination attempt threats.</seg>
<seg id="5">Military spokesperson Major Ntlele Ntoi said that it gives de facto no coup d'etat that however the military reacts to the threat by “political fanatics”, whose armament was approaching by the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">“Which happened this morning was that the staff of the defense forces of Lesotho acted, after it had received several intelligence reports that within the police some elements act, which wanted to actually arm some the political, party-political young fanatics, which stood shortly before, to cause devastating damage” said it opposite Voice OF America.</seg>
<seg id="7">The South African government spokesmen Clayson Monyela said, the military action had made the impression of a revolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Even if nobody maintained the government by force to have actually torn is all reports about it united that the activities of the defense forces of Lesotho show so far signs for a coup d'etat,” said it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Spokesmen of the military of Lesotho communicated on Sunday that the soldiers would withdraw themselves into their barracks and were calm the situation in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the meantime the vice-Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the government guidance during Thabanes absence.</seg>

<seg id="1">Production in the euro zone on a 13-Monats-Tief</seg>
<seg id="2">The rise with production in the euro zone slowed down in August on the lowest point of the last 13 months, so an exactly observed study also.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit purchase manager index of the producing trade (PMI) fell in August on 50,7 in, after conditions of 51,8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">An information concerning 50 indicates an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders decreased and factories experienced break-downs in a time of rising tensions between the European Union and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European central bank (EZB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect a clear plan for handling a hesitating recovery of the euro zone as well as for the threatening deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">It adds to speculations that the director/conductor of the EZB, could make Mario Draghi, in the process of this week more further details, whether it considers a quantitative relief for the euro zone, according to that, which was made by Great Britain and the USA during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">“Although a small growth is better than no growth, is the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturers become,” said more clearly Rob Dobson, leading economist with Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Factory PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner of Russia in the European Union, fell on the lowest level in 11 months with 51,4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime France, PMI fell on 46,9 in the second largest economic nation of the block.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a problem child, like also the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to the stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Referring to it that incentives for growth do not reach in the key industry mechanism Germany as well as into Spain and the Netherlands any longer, are likewise not reassuring,” said Mr. Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The decrease of the industry probably stirs the fire up of the analysts, which expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57,3, the highest level since at the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, Chefwirtschaftsexperte with IHS Global Insight, said: “The best, which one can say for the purchase manager index of the producing trade in the euro zone from August, is that thereafter the sector grows further.”</seg>
<seg id="17">It added: “Producers in the euro zone find the life at present obviously quite with difficulty, there the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly regarding Russia and Ukraine - to uncertainties in the further difficult conditions in many countries increase.</seg>
<seg id="18">These increased uncertainties impaired completely clearly the economy - in particular, and probably lead the confidence of the consumers, and to it that some orders are delayed or even cancellation, in particular large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that it becomes “ever more probable” that the EZB must finally introduce a kind of the QE, “although we assumes that this will be limited.”</seg>

<seg id="37">It was its first school day (Russians go with 7 years into the school) and survived the three-day-long siege in the arms of its mother Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a seven-year-old he said: “Mummy told me, I am to lie down, if there were an explosion, and its hand hold.”</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion thought it, it would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: “Run.”</seg>
<seg id="41">Full fear, it, fled he can be dead and saw on the way a crying infant, seized it at hand and fled by a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father Vladimir, who closed its son outside into the arms, said: “Damir told me that its mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: “I could not save it.”</seg>
<seg id="44">In reality Tamara was tripped after outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part in the acceptance that its son had died.</seg>
<seg id="45">After its reunification she said: “I cried for joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran and embraced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was flown later to London (of the newspaper news OF the World dissolved in the meantime), in order to receive from the Prime Minister at that time Tony Blair and his Mrs. Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's champion.</seg>
<seg id="49">“This horror pursues you each day, but I wished, I could stop with reminding,” said he yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory.</seg>
<seg id="51">I know still that I threw thereafter all my toy pistols away directly.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I cannot play computer games with firing scenes and that am for me a problem now.</seg>
<seg id="53">“I do not have a fear to decrease into the sports hall but I do not think about me.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these children, with whom I played in the yard, and who did not create it after outside.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they were killed or are dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they remained in the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember very well my travel to London, particularly the toys shop, where I could select myself everything, which I wanted, and which trip in an open above car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now it has fear around place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident, which it and its friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror pursues you each day, but I wished, I could stop to remind me of it.</seg>
<seg id="60">“It does in such a way suffering to me around all those, which suffer from the atrocities,” said Damir, which worked past week as a volunteer in a monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so gladly.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to go one day to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy.</seg>
<seg id="63">Its mother Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can imagine you that?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, it gave simply no children, who could call and run around, and this silence persisted many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">It remembers lively its travel to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">Humans in London cried, when I tell our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I understood at that time, how humans on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and shows their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was grateful to Cherie Blair and its foundation for the price and the possibility of traveling in the autumn 2004 to London.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wished, I could Cherie call and to her simply say that 10 years passed, but I the meeting me it and their man in London to still remember, and how the Damir helped and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember still, how Damir wanted to eat gladly borshch and they called all local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember, how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with its water pistol at it and it ran away and played with it.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was only one month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British divided so readily our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: “I always think that this world did not become better in these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Ukraine the war continues now, and each day die humans, and I believe the fact that many children were killed and still is killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">Those are exactly such children like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many the war is a part of the news, which hears it, if they are busy with something different one bored or.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know simply, what these humans feel, the whole horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I cannot stop with feeling.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing changed, humans wants still mutually to kill itself and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir became large and is a very gentle and calm boy, it is aggressive or furious not at all.</seg>
<seg id="82">It does not look for example for revenge, it is not overwhelmed from the past atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not remember gladly, but he has six close friends out of the class and her to go occasionally into the sports hall and ignite there candles.</seg>
<seg id="84">When it was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember, as he on the sofa put sometimes, the face turned away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, its eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I remember also still, how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. Damir is now 17, more largely than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I unite hours was long so safe that it is dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I came myself to the explosion recovered and on the legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with parts of the body lying about everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my small boy in this hell could not possibly have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">“I remember that I shouted him, “Damir, run, run away”, but I was also so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But it heard it and ran away it.</seg>
<seg id="92">And in such a way the life, differently than many different, continues for us.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgij Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose terrible picture became after the siege the symbol of the atrocities from Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with its mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right of a picture of Georgij today</seg>
<seg id="96">Its blutüberströmtes face was drawn of fear, when it ran around its life, while Chechnian terrorists shot his school fellows down.</seg>
<seg id="97">Its picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarism of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">Its mother Fatima, 54, a lady doctor, had set him off for his first school day, before she rushed loosely, in order to bring her older son Vladimir to the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">“I left the yard about two minutes, before the terrorists him stormed, and so remained my small boy there for three terrible days alone,” remember her.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were killed all.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgij created it to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The more near this date moves, the more heavily is it to remember and of it talk.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not one day, on which we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it for a long time ago is, I mean, some scenes would have happened from these days yesterday pursue me all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody is forgotten ever, promises I to you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgently: The picture of Georgij (left) was one the most shocking attack and as Statue (right) was perpetuated.</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that Georgij wanted to go on this day so gladly to the school. He said, he wanted to embrace its teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew only that he alive was, when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this Statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is at home in the bookshelf hidden with us.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I mean also that humans in all world feel our pain owing to this picture.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgij says today: “It is important, which can never happen something like that again.</seg>
<seg id="113">“I doubt that we ever experience the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">Humans examine such tragedies again and again and never experience the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Are we ever experienced, what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world becomes something terrible one.</seg>
<seg id="118">“I cannot understand, how that is possible, because if you ask humans, nobody wants a war, thus as happens that?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years are not nothing at all with such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years, in order to forget it a small little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It attacked my health and feels I it still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years long I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went later in the year 2004 again to the school and had each day fear.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and school fellows, who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">Therefore I always go into the sports hall, if 1 September more near moves.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to mean to mean old childhood friends tribute to tribute.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is heavy for me to go into the sports hall but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as a victim, this history am now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life continues.</seg>
<seg id="131">I concluded and visit this year the school a medical university in Wladikawkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will become a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was training in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not permit that.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgij Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, although he was imprisoned to feet of a murderous terrorist</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was imprisoned during the siege to feet of a murderous terrorist, but he created it to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege it was in the sports hall and sat beside the bomb, which was fastened to the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is really a miracle that it was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">“We feel it, as if it would have been yesterday,” say Georgij, which wanted to go as a secret service officer to FSB, but this because of its health damage due to the siege not to do could.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is not still with me, it is anything that I left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and humans say that children can deal easily with bad experiences - I do not have to say, vote.</seg>
<seg id="144">“2006 I worked with psychologists and felt for it actually somewhat better, but I cannot forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I was gladly forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - in the year after - was the first and only mark that I went again into the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will return never again there and not ask you me ask not to show you where I sat in this famous picture.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of itself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is tremendous and I carries it each day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know the fact that I do not remember gladly or about it speaks and asked it me never for the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically am I well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now run well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I returned my documents, also the medical and answered her that it is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion were the animals, therefore I went to veterinary Institut.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have there already two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals “from cats to cows”.</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: “I knew that I would never report to my children of my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">About it children should not know anything and them should it naturally also suffer.</seg>
<seg id="161">Its mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worse in my soul, if the anniversary moves more near.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the ceremonies to the memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgij will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be still many more violent for it, because he was not and I there.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited at home for him and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of it are drawn.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is heavy to accept if somewhat so unfair happens.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot participate because of its knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">It was operated several times, it can run, but drive no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he overcame the horror 50%, but one can never overcome and forget that completely.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always pursue us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbour were killed with the siege and to strengthened only mean the pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many humans, whom I could do well and who me were expensive.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the largest gift that God could make for me, but my heart cries around the killing.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know from families, in which new children were born, in addition, from widows, who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that the life continues, even if one does not want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I am never forgotten, how my heart jumped in me, when I saw it in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see, what proceeds in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">For what do these humans fight?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill themselves mutually?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is our country now much and I can that nearly not believe.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were in former times a friendly country, how it can be that we fight now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Humans and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children were already killed and still many are killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we only all these rebels to seize and eject could - as far away as only possible.</seg>
<seg id="188">Aljona Tskajewa, 10</seg>
<seg id="189">The baby, who was carried so moving by a special employment command in security</seg>
<seg id="190">Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought by a Russian special employment command in security (left).</seg>
<seg id="191">Them are now ten (right) and remember not at all cruelties</seg>
<seg id="192">Die Welt stopped 2004 the breath, when the baby Aljona in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege was carried of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists let it go, but held back in their cruelty her 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and its brother Makhar in the school sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, at that time three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.</seg>
<seg id="195">Its father Ruslan married since then again and has with his new Mrs. Swetlana a little girl that he called Kristina after his lost daughter.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, today ten years old, remembers the siege and is not grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="197">“You are a large happy family and Aljona and a Makhar are both now great children,” say a close friend.</seg>
<seg id="198">Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants them all the memories to save, which approach with the tenth anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="199">They will understand, why.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 hints for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you liked to make gladly photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The most inexpensive option is a waterproof POINT and Shoot, as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action Cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition, which both are to be had for approximately 300 $.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took up these photos with a family celebration with several cameras, which are available all at a price of under 350 $.</seg>
<seg id="5">Independently of the equipment there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Control your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closely locked.</seg>
<seg id="8">Adjust your camera also to the photos or video, which want to take up you.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and admission modes, with which the exposure time for the dämmrigen underwater conditions is optimized.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump inside, check, until into which depth your equipment is functional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are certified only for up to 5 foot, others to 50 or 60 foot.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look in our purchase leader and the evaluations for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Make for multiple photographs - because many will not fold.</seg>
<seg id="14">POINT and Shoot cameras do not have an LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action Cams normally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to view this under water and the correct framing is a luck thing.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus you take many photographs.</seg>
<seg id="17">If had your camera a row mode, with which a set of photographs also easily changed exposure settings are made, use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Remain close of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you depart from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you remain possible thus closely at the surface, if it photographs in a pool, a lake or the sea to make.</seg>
<seg id="21">Thus you can bring also more color into your photos; the more deeply you go, to the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Approach closely to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is also ashore a good advice, but he is all the more important under water because of the bad lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is completely particularly important, if you work with a Action Cam: These devices often have a firm wide angle lens, which means that you must more closely to your objects near, if these are to fill out the entire picture framework.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, a whose character changes things, even in a as gigantic organization as NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advisory anaesthesia physician he dedicated his career to the task to save to the patients both the death throes of the illness as well as the agonies of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, then its wife remembers, was a MI6-Mitarbeiter, which had to live with the devastating effects of tortures.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to the physicians, while the treated ones are busy with somewhat completely different one predominantly: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in the year 2007 it was however that, whose suffering way began.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I did not feel,” wrote he in the May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to gather up me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While it fought with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that he made impatiently reproaches for his Mrs. Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I want all dearer immediately than later”, noted he.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was, felt for one week on a business trip Lawson unusual-proves completely and without reason concerned.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was appropriate for something in air.</seg>
<seg id="12">It asked a colleague to make an x-ray examination of its chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago it in the French alps to the skiing had been.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the x-ray examination was present.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which attacks the chest skin, thus the lungs covering skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As is the case for most cancer conditions is difficult the exact trigger usually to determine.</seg>
<seg id="17">While for example some smokers at cancer of the lungs get sick, not all cancer of the lungs-gotten sick were early smoker.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In nearly all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was considered once as “miracle material” however in the meantime as deadly was recognized.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is an illness, which can to be easily ignored as.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is finally a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos was not no more used in Great Britain since the 1960er years, than itself the industry obligated voluntarily not to use this no more.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, where it was still used, only humans in certain industries worked directly with the material - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and throwing workers for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial dangerous material from another time it seems to be still causing concern today hardly.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.</seg>
<seg id="26">Great Britain, then seems it, deeply felt today the high point of an Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">It gives more deaths by mesothelioma here than in every other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With altogether 2,500 deaths per year twice as many humans at this illness die as with traffic accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual numbers of the mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and prospective future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason, why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999 all asbestos types forbidden), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge the mesothelioma is not limited on former workers the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is frequently still, in the houses present, in which we live, which offices, in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and which business, in which we buy.</seg>
<seg id="33">And from there mesothelioma does not know class barriers, financial borders, professions or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building are asbestos-contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals, in which we are nevertheless healthy to become to be supposed, already as an output herd of this deadly carcinogenic agent constituted.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also no plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It fell it indeed heavily to introduce itself where he could possibly have come with asbestos into contact.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then it found it out.</seg>
<seg id="41">“It looks in such a way, as if in the tunnels at the Guy's hospital, where I completed six years long my training, was present a quantity asbestos.” it wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All - students, nurses, physicians and doormen - use the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One asks oneself, how many become my contemporaries at the same illness suffering?</seg>
<seg id="44">It could unfortunately at least partly answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="45">“Of the four physicians, who were trained at the Guy's hospital, and who got sick in the last five years at mesothelioma”, wrote he to 2010 in a letter, “are I the latter, still live.”</seg>
<seg id="46">How will many of us still get sick?</seg>
<seg id="47">With Andrew Lawson mesothelioma at the age was diagnosed by 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When it died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">That was an unusually long survival period.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all mesothelioma-gotten sick die within 8 months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The illness ends always mortally.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can repeat from there only Lawsons question: “Will still get sick like many of us?”</seg>
<seg id="53">The prominent expert of Great Britain to mesothelioma, professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, if the asbestos epidemic will presumably come into Great Britain to succumbing altogether to the victim it will be pleased to 90,000 of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of it have for the moment still no idea that they will die in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A short view of the documents of the courts, to which the concerning turn frequently because of demands for payment of damages, shows, how far the scourge of the mesothelioma is already common.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June this Marks & Spencer added for example, Janice Allen to year negligent-proves asbestos to have suspended.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked nine years long for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible over the clothe department on two locations - one of it the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years as, when it began her activity with M&S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now it has two children in the 20s.</seg>
<seg id="61">“Before this thing,” it says, “I ever of mesothelioma had heard, I not yet times really did not know something about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I would have never thought that would concern me times.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are only few humans, who know much about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">Fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name is due to the word “Asbestiform”, a description of the fibrous structure, which makes the material resistant and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotil, also as white asbestos admits, is today by far most frequently found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof slabs, floor panels, Rohrisolationen, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less mortally as other asbestos forms, of the European Union and the WTO as “large health risk” with possible resulting in death is however nevertheless viewed.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous are however the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Great Britain was once the world largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts assume that “there are clear, however indirect notes for it that this was a principal reason for the singularly high mesothelioma rates.”</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to London, asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen did not see herself perhaps as a typical mesothelioma victim, but it points the work of Julian Peto to the fact that her history is not under any circumstances unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">It submitted a study of the concerning, in which it is represented that “a substantial portion of the mesotheliomas without well-known suspension was probably caused by work or in the house by asbestos contact in the environment.”</seg>
<seg id="75">A majority of these contacts is based to its statement after on the “normal use and aging” of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks in such a way, as if nobody can assume that to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report of Goddard consulting, which examined the palace of Westminster, shows, how humans could have been suspended also in the heart of the government, unknowingly the material.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 reported Goddard that the service pits and pipings behind the committee areas of the parliament with asbestos were contaminated, whose deadly fibers could be whirled up by somewhat as harmless as “strong air movements”.</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of parliament are frequently accused of to worry about their own interests but it looks in such a way here, as if the opposite would apply.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the management of the parliamentary one insisted labor service on the fact that the Westminsterpalast a “clean health certificate” had received, is it in the meantime undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years be brought up must, in order the parliament to recondition, the electricity installations to modernize and the asbestos remove, and that after the general elections 2015 the delegates will meet probably rather in the nearby QE2-Konferenzzentrum as in the green banks in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report pointed out also that “the presence was not handled by asbestos according to the respective regulations.”</seg>
<seg id="82">Nobody can know whether this Miss management will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">Everything that one can do now, is waits.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person, those the contact with asbestos exactly to never determine could is Graham Abbott, a general physician.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott assumes that it was exposed to the asbestos during its work in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">“I worked in a hospital, in which asbestos complaints were decided positively”, say he, “however I can it in my case not prove.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all places on which one worked, and the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">That it is still exactly reminded the day at the beginning of December 2009, on which he got so a kind fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">It was 45, and accomplished straight late in the evening an operation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had vibration frost.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came completely suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terribly.</seg>
<seg id="93">I believed not to create the trip home any longer.</seg>
<seg id="94">When physician knew Abbott that the pain was due to the skin to the chest skin, around its lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But like Janice Allen it did not have a reason to assume a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">It did not go one month to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Surprised physicians made radiographs of his chest and set Pleurakathether, in order to take and test in the laboratory liquid out of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="98">Its complaints remained however without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Its health improved slowly, and it returned to its job.</seg>
<seg id="100">Occasionally the symptoms returned however, frequently to sporty manipulation and violent breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">2011 came a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in its practice and with mesothelioma were later made a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="102">In addition, now did not connect Abbott this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">Finally its patient was older some decades and directly with asbestos had worked.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 Abbotts condition worsened again and its family doctor brought its CT-scans and radiographs to a team of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, accurately two years after Abbott for the first time suffer yourself had felt, became a probe equipped with a camera into the cave between the rib and the chest skin inserted.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I continue mostly simply,” say he.</seg>
<seg id="109">Honestly said, I had worried not at all so many.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was anxious.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the Biopsie was present in the week between Christmas and New Year: “One told me that it was mesothelioma.”</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, of whom one recommended to him to take itself a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">He understood the extent of the epidemic only now.</seg>
<seg id="115">“It turned out that asbestos was very far common, particularly in large public buildings, in which pipes were insulating with asbestos often,” says it.</seg>
<seg id="116">Humans, who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings, get sick now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And in such a way mesothelioma meets now younger people, who did not work in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay underground, therefore patients were probably rather not exposed to the material.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who changed in pedestrian tunnels of a building in the other one (how Andrew Lawson) or in underground cafeterias ate (like it Graham Abbott often did), came with largest probability into contact with the poisonous substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It is shown that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients were possibly life-saving, but life-threateningly for the treating physicians.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is also still today removed.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils turned their Bunsen burners off to asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it does not only concern hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was used due to its marvelous isolating and flame retarding characteristics frequently in offices, business, libraries and town halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Also schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Actually many humans probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils turned off their Bunsen burners to asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">To web pages the topic asbestos is now frequently responded in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile as innocent articles contained asbestos in our houses as floor panels or shed roofs according to standard.</seg>
<seg id="130">“It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our real estate is contained,” notices Andrew Morgan, the attorney, who represented Andrew Lawson during its process against Guy's hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In a case the only contact, which occurred to a woman concerned, was the outline of a garden shed into the 1970ern.</seg>
<seg id="132">Thus you watch out, how you tear your garden shed off.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the illness is incurable, it is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">“It takes a while to process” says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went again to the work and tried to make further but I noticed that I could not concentrate on that, which I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and to care me around me.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well yes, I will experience no further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the largest difficulty was the Perspektivwechsel of the position of a physician to some patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him it reminds of it, how he overwhelms from all the information was, with whom it by right to come oneself had.</seg>
<seg id="141">“It was very heavy to take up all this” says it.</seg>
<seg id="142">“I asked mean physician “like for a long time have I still?”</seg>
<seg id="143">And one gave me still about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I do not remember that I thought, “well yes, I a further Christmas will experience.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was it then. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious, because it our life support mechanism - which breathing - it is that causes the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">If that is whirled up asbestos and the fibers are inhaled, they can itself in the chest skin, which skin around the lungs, to determine.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can cell mutations release.</seg>
<seg id="151">“The problem develops in such a way for professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax physician, who changed 2001 to the Guy's hospital with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,”.</seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital, by which Andrew Lawson is assumed a prominent center that it exposed him to the asbestos, now ironically, with the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some different, which were probably likewise during their training in the hospital exposed to the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “it by the breath procedure to the edge is pressed, where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">By nature it is invasive from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options with other cancer conditions do not work with mesothelioma so well.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation is for example hot disputed.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some it mean that she is worth an attempt.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure answers that in the negative.</seg>
<seg id="160">“One cannot cut the chest skin out,” says he.</seg>
<seg id="161">They do not come around with the measurer therefore.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer does not address “on chemotherapy very well,” the “effect shows”, but does not heal.</seg>
<seg id="163">“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately some patients live actually for a long time, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">To two and a half year after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott fights still.</seg>
<seg id="168">After it had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become four years after its diagnosis a one-man support and a consulting office for affected too ones.</seg>
<seg id="169">To “cancer center,” he had an interview hello, with calls merrily.</seg>
<seg id="170">“It was very positive,” says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">It had received and was still very active its diagnosis 4 years before.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally Abbott six chemotherapy cycles had been offered, which would extend four months to last and its life presumably only by one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">“I had despaired,” say he.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson created it however “the things in a somewhat more positive light appear to let.”</seg>
<seg id="176">After the consultation of several physicians decided Abbott, its treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski to continue Herz-Thorax-Spezialist at the Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">“We had an advantage thereby that I did not have to be further-referred, I called simply and got a date,” admit Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and for the approval of the treatment to wait would have.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for mesothelioma-gotten sick, in order to be able to notice the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments finally fail inevitably, many concerning of another financial concern stand - over the future of the families, which leave them.</seg>
<seg id="181">And in such a way they turn to the courts in hope for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan von Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">“It is since 1898 well-known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health,” says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But which changed into the 1960ern is that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital settled her case finally, but it was not what calls Morgan a “full compensation”, since Lawson could not prove with absolute security that its mesothelioma was to due to an asbestos contact at the Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation to its death a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed however that “the asbestos fibers in the basement area concerned were removed into the 1990ern.”</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">As asbestos can be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">It is actual for mesothelioma-gotten sick, which strive for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - normally decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers were closed sold or.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those, which resist requirements, know that the time for it is, but completely surely not with the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="194">As reaction to it there were clear new legislation, which simpler for mesothelioma-concerned it makes in this year, to sue for a compensation even if their former employers are not to be found any longer.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law could prove from the insurance industry promoted funds of 350 million £ for all furnished, which were diagnosed after July 2012, a contact, but nobody to sue be able.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases the plaintiffs receive 80 percent its that could have awarded a court in them - about 120,000 to normal damage suit £.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful requests with the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks as so many mesothelioma-concerned that 350 million represented £ to “very good work” of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">“That is a deal of insurers for insurers,” says it, and suggests the fact that it concerns with this sum a quarter of its, which insurers would have had to pay, if the time had not passed over it and mesothelioma-got sick the enterprises find and it normally sue could.</seg>
<seg id="200">Also Mike Penning, work at that time and pension Minister, admitted that the law was not perfect “”.</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan addition that in view of seven victims daily fast acting was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">“Humans suffer so much and need today assistance,” said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in the December of the past year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After its first consultation long Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect contrary to Tom Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied by a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy, with which long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">“That is naturally the most important with,” says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">One sees that again and again with patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is there something that lets you continue.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you give up, are you very fast more badly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent in March 2012 of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August had it the last six chemotherapy cycles behind itself.</seg>
<seg id="213">Aftercare scans did not show any signs of the illness.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several cancer marks around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I became straight 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">That is life-terminating.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now no trace of the tumors is more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the procedure is physically and psychologically much exerting.</seg>
<seg id="222">They must think of practical things - of the money, if I am not any more, for example, or my wife to show, how the storage water heater time attitude functions.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, become negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">They must look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">“For parents that is heavy,” says it.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is difficult to know, what one is to say and like much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I mean first diagnosis received, said I mean girls that I would have an illness, with which I would become not old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted completely differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very informal and impetuous.</seg>
<seg id="231">It told her friends and we got soon a great many calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">She did not say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such discussions are something, which all cancer patients must go through.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for mesothelioma-gotten sick such discussions are from hope did not pull through, not from a trace of hope for surviving.</seg>
<seg id="236">The illness brings (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) a furious security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses Hong Kong right to government choice, demonstrator swears retaliation</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided despite the increased calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the Hongs Konger constituency.</seg>
<seg id="3">This action probably beacons the long announced protests in of Hong Kong business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization in addition within a few hours after the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese congress of people makes it possible to the communist leaders in principle to reject all not Peking-faithful candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">“Does not come unexpectedly, but it makes us nevertheless furious,” said Rechtsexpertin Emily Lau, chairman of the democratic party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what had promised Peking.</seg>
<seg id="7">One lay the inhabitants of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In its defense of the Chinese decision said left protect, vice-Secretary-General of the standing committee of the national congress of people that the permission of public nominations would be “chaotic” with the elections for the Hongs Konger government too.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since has Peking promised 1997, when Great Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, to let the inhabitants select starting from 2017 the government presidency.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese guidance presented the decision of Sunday as democratic break-through, because there is the citizen of Hong Kong a direct right to vote, but it makes the decision also clear that the Chinese guidance keeps the expiration firmly by a nomination committee controlled closely of Peking in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition after a new clause only candidates are to become certified “with love for the country and love for Hong Kong”.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows one summer, in which some the largest and audience-most effective protests in Hong Kong for some years took place.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the per-democratic campaign in Hong Kong the movement Occupy cent ral With Love stands and for Peace, whose organizers threatened to bulkhead the financial district if Peking does not permit genuine general right to vote.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening within a few hours after the announcement hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain before government headquarters in Hong Kong had met.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration the organizers said that its movement had achieved a new stage of civil disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They made however no more details to apparently avoid in order problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a report of online the organizers communicated that the movement considered “the occupation of the central district only as last means, an action, which was to take place only if all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.</seg>
<seg id="19">It does suffering to us, says to have that today all dialogue opportunities were exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong prepared for days for the announcement of Peking, and intensified security measures were valid for police force and barricades inclusively on Sunday before the government building.</seg>
<seg id="21">The riots are strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose slowly control of their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of humans of the mainland strengthens the competition around products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition the fear grows that the values of Hong Kong begin to crumble such as democracy and free speech under the increasing pressure of Peking.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, there it the business concern - which vital lines of Hong Kong - endanger.</seg>
<seg id="25">“The protests, of which they speak, could cause large economic damage, depending on, like many in it are involved and like for a long time them to persist,” said Rechtsexpertin Regine Ip, which criticizes the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stir fears up that Hong Kong turns out out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investments.</seg>
<seg id="28">The state-controlled mediums of China reported also recently on Demokratieaktivisten in Hong Kong as subversive agents steered of western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">In this summer activists organized an unofficial referendum to the choice elections, in which 780,000 humans participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands participated in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize race question and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants lifted their hands into air and sang, “hands highly, do not shoot,” during them before the funeral waited.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of shooting the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience white feminist commentators set the sex before the race, if it concerns to address reproduction right and income inequalities.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions in the middle west rose however and generally speaking country it received attention Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% around the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the comparison with the answers of black women shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles did not only come like “thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman” and “feminism turn around the suppression of women” relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez an important change meant.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I do not believe that one finds many humans, who speak privileges in so high-class kind about Weis its and in feminism” said her.</seg>
<seg id="10">Humans felt pushed to express something to the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis, in which we are and because the situation is so ethnisiert in Ferguson that they must express.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University brought Ferguson of problems to the light, black Americans are exposed to which each day, who however not when “women's issues” are regarded in the cultural area.</seg>
<seg id="13">“I can something hilarious ones on Facebook over me and mean partners publish and get 150 Likes from all sides,” said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post somewhat over it how colored ones are located in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">“As it can be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship but not over security in the public area?” she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women such as Mitchell, which studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between race and sex problems.</seg>
<seg id="17">For it black women did not have the luxury separate the topics cleanly; they live each day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women connect now the topics race and sex in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, Professorin for women and sex research says at George Mason University that its predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason were nearly always the rape of a white woman,” said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in history, in order to justify the lynching murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery splitting came between white and black women at the point, at that white fighters for the women's suffrage such as Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years the 19. Century it analyzed and stated that the fight for the right to vote could be successful only for in each case a group: Women or black ones.</seg>
<seg id="22">“You made the decision to use itself for the women's suffrage and which right to vote for black ones should come later,” said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If one remembers such things, it becomes conscious one with power why colored women white women not to trust.</seg>
<seg id="24">We did not make our job good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We helped never black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Also after women received 1920 the right to vote, it took still another one decade, until white women organized themselves against lynching into the Association OF Southern Woman for the Prevention OF Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group developed nearly 40 years after the original request for assistance on the part of black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions - police behavior, racial discrimination -, raised by Ferguson, is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists “catching” played with the problems, with which black women sat down for generations apart.</seg>
<seg id="29">“Wouldn't it be great, if the Aktivistinnen, which have such traditional feminist platforms the right to education of a child as seriously would take as it with the right to conception control do?” Mitchell asked.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation, which develops its career on the fight for reproduction rights and the entrance to conception-preventing means, try to understand now, what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The well-known white feminist activists Gloria Steinem two week to shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a trenchant article of Rebecca Carroll, Kolumnistin of the Guardian went, in which she requires more protests from white Americans to the topic racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I hope that women, who have another, but parallel reason for it the body an inherent danger to understand - and opinions to the race, which are in public surveys clearly different - the changes would start become,” wrote Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for a feminism rather intersektionalen, in which race is addressed just like sex topics, is nevertheless astonished some from their comments to the race topic in America.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommers, Forscherin at the American Enterprise Institute and authoress of “Who Stole Feminism?” The People that young men are far more vulnerable in the United States, in particular young colored men, “than their sisters, said” however of stone Ems remarks to Ferguson stands contrary to its earlier criticism opposite She.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but nearly nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the white house presented recently a small program, My Brother's keeper, in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, it gave annoying reactions of many feminists, under it to Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship of the police to the black Community is not the only problem that into the foreground of mainstream feminism pushes itself.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US-border police took up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied persons under age at the southwest border of the country in this year, also the topic of the immigration reform steps the surface - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, CO-chairman von We Belong Together, an organization, which mobilizes women for the immigration reform, said that for a new view of the topic as a substantial women's issue she had to only publish stories of the immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">“These speak for itself,” said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the large majority of the work visas goes to male immigrants, are the women, who accompany her, in a position, in which they are susceptible to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">“These stories find a response in the women's organizations,” told them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Genetic disturbance often wrongly makes a diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="2">A Briton says, it thought as consequence of a wrong diagnosis about many years that it would die.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers lived nearly her entire youth in the faith that she had to only live few years, after she had been diagnosed with another illness.</seg>
<seg id="4">She suffered actually from the Charcot Marie Tooth illness (CMT) - a group inherited disturbances, which damage the nerves outside of the brain and the spinal cord.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK communicated that wrong diagnoses are a frequent problem with humans with CMT, because so little admits over this illness is.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23,000 humans in Great Britain probably suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disturbances such as myasthenia, an uncertain course and curved toes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Got sick suffer also with deafness feelings or pain. The illness is incurable and progressively, which means that the symptoms become worse with the time.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffers from Friedreich ataxia (COMPANY) - an illness with very bad chances of survival.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought, it in the wheelchair would sit, before them became 18, and before their 30. Birthday die.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother of two children, that is 51 years old today, said: “As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.</seg>

<seg id="12">I could never drive with the other children roller skate or skateboard and go at school because of my kind and run was often teased.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said that she saw their patient document at the age of 13 years after several operations for the discharge of her Achilles' tendons and aspect ratio of their feet, when their physician had left and read the room that she suffered from COMPANIES.</seg>
<seg id="14">“I felt guiltily, because I had been curious, therefore I the nobody told, but I went home, looked for the illness in the library and wrote the company company,” said her.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I received answer, I was shocked and came dreadfully into panic.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought that I would be with 18 in the wheelchair and with 25 to die, and between them slowly all my abilities would lose.</seg>
<seg id="17">I constituted that everything alone with me and planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said, when them became 17, it clearly that had not so strongly removed her abilities, like it had introduced themselves and asked her physician.</seg>
<seg id="19">He rose simply, and embraced themselves and said, “my love, I does not believe not that you have that, otherwise now already wärst you in the wheelchair.”</seg>
<seg id="20">I believe, you have somewhat by far less life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="21">After some genetic tests with their CMT was determined.</seg>
<seg id="22">“As he me explained, what CMT was, I felt me, as if I would be a winner,” said her.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tax burden of businessmen in the area Washington rises with the economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customer, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It means also higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">National and local tax assessments for enterprises in the country rose last year easily, while the economic recovery accelerated itself, so a again published study in the past week, and the companies in the area Washington did not form an exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Enterprises in the area District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to national and local places in the financial year 2013, a rise by 3,8 percent in relation to the incomes of 2012 at a value of 26.6 billion $.</seg>
<seg id="6">The national and local fiscal charges of the enterprises rose last year by 4,3 percent to 671 billion $ on, compared with 3,9 percent in the year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">National taxes rose more strongly than the local deliveries, by 4,3 percent, so the study, which was accomplished by the service agency Ernst & Young with the center for national taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent, originates from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the incomes of Maryland from enterprises originate.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia obtains the smallest tax revenues from enterprises with 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">A majority of the rise with the tax revenues is justified in a recovery of the real estate values of the enterprises, says the researchers, what led to an increase of the real estate taxes by 3,7 percent in this year after the three following each other years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large part of these profits originated from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiration seems to apply also to the area Washington.</seg>
<seg id="12">Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid together over 10 billion $ at national and local real estate taxes last year, compared with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise in the process of one year by 4,2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery at the real estate values is not so effective in Maryland with the increase of national and local tax revenues, since the real estate taxes amount here to scarcely more than one fifth of the tax assessments of enterprises.</seg>
<seg id="14">Enterprises in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their national and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">“In Maryland the following happens: a large part of the real estate, in particular in the tax area around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or from Non profit organizations, which do not pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, Geschäftsführer the center of on State rating.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is compelling much more on the income taxes to rely for example in order to be able to offer the same services, which offer other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery with the tax revenues by enterprises cannot be added alone to the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Enterprise incomes seem to likewise recover, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Enterprises in the region reported over income taxes with state organisations of 2.3 billion $ compared with 2.1 billion in the year 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes, the highest amount of the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend goes into the same direction, the local tax burden for enterprises does not rise evenly at all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average, while the rise was clearly higher in Maryland, with 4,3 percent 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia announced a tax revenue below average of 4,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has with 6 percent in all three competences clearly smallest enterprise income taxes (in all three there is firm of taxation of enterprises sets).</seg>
<seg id="25">The taxation of enterprises set in Maryland lies with 8,25 percent and in the District with relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A comparable study of the US-Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia smaller national and local corporate taxes are required and altogether a better tax climate prevail than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study the District was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages Virginia stands under pressure by his southern neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina adopted laws for the lowering of his taxation of enterprises sets in this year from 6,9 percent to 6 percent, which same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will sink in the coming year on 5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state reaches further its income goals in the coming year, this law could reduce the enterprise income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime the small firms in the area Washington seem to be better, and they pay from there more national and local taxes, so the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes, those as personal income taxes by small businessmen to be paid - a transition structure, after which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $, a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes altogether.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably stop country with the corporate taxes generally speaking in this year, with an increase of the general multi-military tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6,2 percent in the first three quarter 2014 in the comparison to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless the area Washington could lag behind, if the output shortage of the Federal Government affects the job market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is called in Germany also canton, is one of the richest cities of China, promoted left.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore humans would possess also the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who stated the German politician delegation, assured to the host, he in Germany about a possible partner for the project will ask around.</seg>
<seg id="11">“For beer it needs not much: ”, he added good water, grain and joy of life with the lunch with the party-upper in Guangzhou.</seg>

<seg id="15">Tsingtao beer is brewed after the German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More course of business</seg>
<seg id="17">A second desire of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice-party chief left.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa the flight had in former times offered, but in the year 2012 for economic reasons had painted.</seg>
<seg id="19">“It again to be worth”, was it shown the local politician convinced.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for 1.04 billion $</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON confirmed just now, what had reported information on Monday mornings: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US-$).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected an assumption of Twitch, but because it was assumed far away that YouTube would acquire the enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it looked in such a way, as if the sale of Twitch was to the video service of Google for a cool billion done deal, and co-operation appeared also naturally.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, which was only created before three years as Justin.tv, was started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead it became fast a platform for players, who published their bravura pieces in plays wanted, a “YouTube for live plays”, such an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And “let's play”, a video category, in which know-it-alls give a painting of secret science theatre (usually older) to the plays, are on YouTube already much likes.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is just like that YouTube is often called, if one wants to describe Twitch therefore became the message that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, something bored taken up, a text book example of an established technology enterprise, which buys up a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery, why that did not come deal with YouTube, since the enterprise was ready according to reports, just as much to pay as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything that we know for the moment about it, is this statement of Emmet Shear, Präsident von Twitch: “We have ourselves for Amazon decided, because they believe in our Community, it divide our values and long-term visions and them want us to help to arrive faster there.”</seg>
<seg id="12">A further secret is honestly said, unbelievable success by Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me, which explain that they drive dear sport as thereby to watch, are it heavily to understand the attraction which assumes that, others when playing to watch instead of even the control console into the hand to take.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a thing to look a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while it creeps by resident Evil, and somewhat completely different one to watch a crank how it is shot 20 times successively in call OF Duty into the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">All these plays could view you now straight.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem lies in it that many of the popular plays are today ego plays, therefore can watching without own control of the view perspective a correctly good recipe for headache be.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the high-speed runs, into which of Roger Bannisters's our electronics age whole plays in record time complete are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as play or humor-virtuoso is not thereby, its Twitch channel is probably not so much interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But which sceptics know like I already of it?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called of 55 million different visitor per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet peak traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly does Amazon from it want to make money?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is heavy to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant video, as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed simply.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something that would have each enterprise gladly: Thousands of young men, who are wooed as advertising customers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Like the chairman Shear, said von Twitch, Amazon and Twitch “did not believe both in the future of the Gaming,” and the medium shows signs of a contraction, not yet times - sip - as spectator haven.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the hopping castle with the castle garden festival some was the matter on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organizers was correct.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the strong downpour on Saturday evening came roughly 1200 of music fan to the open air celebration in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">Occasionally had admit to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">“That was annoying”, said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel l light and joke.</seg>
<seg id="7">From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the open air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is to radiate brightness on the day and in the evening by various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and joke comes anyway from alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">That showed up already in early Saturday, when the first visitors opened themselves to the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that succeeded to them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Approximately around the supply conditions on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, in addition, guests from the closer and further environment had made themselves it cosy.</seg>
<seg id="14">They pursued the first live appearances, whipped with the foot in the beat, enjoyed cool beverages - short: Relaxation purely and benefit were announced.</seg>
<seg id="15">And straight through the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While the one on covers on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lolled themselves, others at a quarter wine in the Vinothek refreshed themselves, raved the new generation on the hopping castle, which was a large point of attraction for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, with child make-ups had the voluntary aides in the true sense of the word all hands fully to do, in order to become the crush gentleman and do magic fantasyful creations into the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The larger ones used the kicker tables or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel aligned.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the large rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it pelted down on the visitors, above all families looked for that width and dry one.</seg>
<seg id="21">But did to the attractiveness of the celebration this no abort.</seg>
<seg id="22">“Came more humans than expected”, said Ron Sem, which spoke of a “success on the whole line”.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore oppose a repetition of the large party in the coming year nothing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although on contents and size of the event must be still worked, Sem in a first balance made clear on Sunday in relation to the voice of the people.</seg>
<seg id="25">As annoying designated it that in the meantime admit to be stopped had.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously the security company had been booked also too few forces.</seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Some, which had already paid, did not come any longer on the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">The resonance was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first careful estimation the Salzwedeler Mitorganisator spoke of approximately 1200 visitors, who cavorted in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the audio engineering.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler hip hop volume of block ` n ` Rox fallow their appearance therefore weakens off.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned Shisha Lounges could not be developed, because the tents could not be brought because of a flat tyre to Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="34">“In the next year they will be however thereby”, so the organizer.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere the Amula open airs from the numbers of visitors had more than succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However the organizers committed some errors, which are still forgiven with the first time, but with the second edition to be eliminated to have.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also in the social network Facebook must put the organizers in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">“Sorry, but for twelve euros one expected, expresses themselves simply more” Melanie Meier on the event side.</seg>
<seg id="40">“Took over, means you you unfortunately a little” Ele Carpenter in same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not see the initial problems completely so closely.</seg>
<seg id="42">I find it very good that some do not only chat stupidly, but also really tries something on the legs to place.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hat off! ”, Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now one year remains for the organizers time, in order to turn these points of criticism off.</seg>

<seg id="12">While the castle friends had the deceased Richard Dimbath to last a reconstruction of the castle at the mountain forest in the eye around that suddenly, the “development and experiencing bar making” of the area in foremost place stand for the castle club around Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second chairmen of the castle friends, was pleased according to their own statements about the call very much.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death it manages the castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found to in the middle of Septembers in a meeting of the members.</seg>
<seg id="16">Momentarily the club counts 74-year old approximately 40 members according to.</seg>
<seg id="17">“After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we let the club activities from respect rest first”. This “thinking phase” was necessary, in order to consider “, like it to continue could”.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl the new chairman is to then go into the discussion with the castle club.</seg>
<seg id="19">By then the castle friends could make themselves also a current painting conveying a special atmosphere within their grouping.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is, says a candidate for the presidency momentarily not yet Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">“However I am confident that someone will be”. He does not want to stand as a candidate, because he has his domicile in bath Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer wants to cooperate in the project “however very gladly further”.</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view in things reconstruction will probably remain existing in the eyes Piffls in next time.</seg>
<seg id="25">It appreciates Dimbath as “missionary”, which always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far progressed projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a castle in the air.</seg>
<seg id="27">By a high participation of the population as well as by voluntary aides from all over the world they are a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: “Also I was at the beginning sceptical.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the course of the time I am more and more arrived at the conviction that it is meaningful, the project to advance”. A “unique selling proposition” can be created for the Flößerstadt.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here it gives nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the project would be eligible for financing by European Union-subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">“I do not want to throw the idea of the reconstruction personally therefore simply over board”. He hope that perhaps the castle club in this point moves something.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal of documenting history first “is important and good”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Afterwards one would know further marriages.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smarter ways to saving with university text books</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the costs of university text books of many students more than 1,000 $ per year are, the nearly secondary term student Matt Schroeder considered himself a smarter savings idea.</seg>
<seg id="3">It invented a borrowing system for books of students of higher terms and offered a nominal compensation, in order to delay the back sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">“My mathematics book costs normally 180 $, but I received it for 10 $ for one term and a Chick fil A cookie,” said Schroeder, 19, the Covenant college in Georgia visited.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the last term the needed books would have cost, said it to 430 $ it.</seg>
<seg id="6">It spent 120 $.</seg>
<seg id="7">The college line communicated, which students spend annually on the average more than 1,200 $ on text books and study material that there would be different curbing cost expansion options for the students however.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting of text books becomes more popular, and so students can use a book one term long, frequently for clearly a favourable price than with the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university book shops, communicated that renting librettos had doubled itself since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books was rented in the college book shops in the past spring semester, said Neebos vice-president Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all text books according to statement of the trade association national Association OF college store in campus book shops are bought.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the multiplication table for best deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Online buy</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books cost online only one third of the price, for which they are to be had in the campus book shop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of “calculus” vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly 290 $, can however with the specialized text book retailer Chegg .com for 239,99 $ be referred.</seg>
<seg id="17">Used buy</seg>
<seg id="18">If the notes other or normal signs of usage anything do not constitute, used books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">“Calculus” is to be had used on Chegg.com for 93,49 $.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, conclusion student at Brigham Young University, says that it spent 42 cents on Amazon.com on a used edition of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business end to OF The Advertising Business.”</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was sold again for 48 $.</seg>
<seg id="22">University graduate such as Ingrid Bracey, Leiterin of the University OF Massachusetts at the Amherst college Without of embankment recommended students to inquire with her professors whether earlier expenditures were permissible.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases older expenditures can often be acquired for a fraction of the costs of the newest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Except Chegg and Amazon also Half.com of eBay Inc. is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rents</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting text books is a consideration worth, if you treat it to some extent well, remembers, to return it and you the books after conclusion of the course not kept would like.</seg>
<seg id="28">They can save more than 80 percent of the costs of a again bought book.</seg>
<seg id="29">A student could rent for example “calculus” for the duration terms for approximately 20 $.</seg>
<seg id="30">Inform about the regulations of the business with that you rent yourselves, also about the penalty charges, which result if necessary for the letter of notes, underlinings or signs of usage.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tenant watched out: If you do not return the book, the penalty charges can even exceed the price of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="32">E-Books</seg>
<seg id="33">Also E-Books instead of conventional text books are an option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes these books are de facto rented, by an electronic license for a certain period of wholesale dealers such as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc. one makes available.</seg>
<seg id="35">With Chegg one can rent “calculus” for 6 months for approximately 61 $.</seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says that students in literature courses find frequently the best offers, since many classical authors can be downloaded nowadays free of charge, while scientific and engineer-scientific text books can be very expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">In any case look around.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Gault, 29, which will visit the Pepperdine Law School shortly, recommends the ISBN number for the price regulation with books, since one can be so safe, to find the correct text book.</seg>
<seg id="39">And before an online order one should check, so Gault whether the book is actually available.</seg>
<seg id="40">He learned this lesson the hard way.</seg>
<seg id="41">He bought a book the fact that four weeks delivery time had and paid finally the full price in the college book shop.</seg>

<seg id="6">“We wanted to show a positive reaction”, said counsel for the defense Thomas Schrammel, that with its wonderful guidance Volley of the sixteen-horizontal bar in the 14. Minute the switches set to victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">“I imagined, I strike whole frustration of Thursday purely and snapped him under the slat”, meant the 26-year old smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Schrammel to 13. Novmember had met 2010 to the last mark in a Bundesliga portion, still was for Ried.</seg>

<seg id="17">Barisic found even that one had been better “in many plays than today” before - against “the strongest crew, which played in this season in this stadium”.</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since 26 July proved from there that the crew structure the setbacks is intact to the defiance: “Today my crew showed that it has a character”.</seg>
<seg id="19">For it not less pleasing: “That we played finally again to zero”.</seg>
<seg id="20">Much work during international match break also the circumstance that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several losses are to be deplored, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schobesberger their first eleven debuts gave, make the victory still more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">“One may not forget that”, reminded Barisic, which lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, “those lately was very stable”.</seg>
<seg id="22">The international match break must be used from there to add over “wounds to leaking and in the physical range a little”, explained Barisic, who has five U21-Auswahlakteure in its rows.</seg>
<seg id="23">One, which the break probably particularly suits, is a captain Hofmann.</seg>

<seg id="27">For the 33-year old, its 350. Bundesliga play completed, was it the first hit from the play since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: “Being allowed not to believe the fact that now everything is good” “we has probably also a little luck had but sometime must come the luck also to us back.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now was it high time”, said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded certainly to concentrated continuing working: “One may do that not always black and knows to see.</seg>

<seg id="32">In addition, we may not believe that everything is good now.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could not deny the meaning of its role for the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is nevertheless a very young crew, which I can help for the moment much.</seg>
<seg id="35">Adhere in certain phases nevertheless to me on”, said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig coach Michael Baur had itself to accuse and its crew little.</seg>
<seg id="37">It regretted the fast goal against “from the category charm gate”, as well as the regular gate of use in the 40. Minute, which had been denied by arbitrator Kollegger to injustice.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only reproach, which I can make for the crew am that we were not concrete direction gate in some phases enough.</seg>
<seg id="39">There we had too few conclusions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin requires the admission of “statehood discussions” of Kiev with east Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian president Wladimir Putin required Russian media reports according to on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops and directly with negotiations to the “statehood” of the disloyal region takes up the fights against the separatists in the east of the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow got straight later that Putin had not meant with it that the area standing under control of the separatists becomes east Ukraine a part of Russia, but that its status must be redefined opposite Ukraine, in order to give to the Russian-speeking region power for the agency of his rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Of Putin call to the Kiev government to negotiations on eye level with the per-Russian insurgent ones fits however the strategy apparently pursued by him since beginning of the excesses five months ago: Help for the separatists when taking areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government, in order to make for the again proclaimed region possible Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of with the west.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the national television station channel unity condemned Putin the Ukrainian military campaign to the recapture of the areas in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, thought of separatists, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea to 18. March had annexed.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists called lately the taken area “Novorossija” or “new Russia”, a term, which reminds of the pre-revolutionary gloss time of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those, which attack in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 October and during government groups civilian communities in the areas thought of separatists for imminent peace talks hope “in their illusions” are imprisoned reported Itar Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">“We must take up immediately detailed discussions, not only to technical questions, but also for the political organization of the society and the state status of southeast Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of there living humans,” said it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said the fact that of Putin reference to the statehood in the context with the larger autonomy had to be seen, which is discussed for months by the Kiev guidance, in order to scatter fears in Russian-speeking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights is endangered.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, said Peskow.</seg>
<seg id="11">Here not Ukraine and Russia goes, said Peskow, “because it not around a conflict between Russia around negotiations between and Ukraine goes, but around an internal conflict in Ukraine.”</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for the correction of the “misinterpretation” of Putin remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia while handling the separatist rebellion in the east contrary to the direct Annektion the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitant ethnic Russians are.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far larger difficulties to annex the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine since most of the 6.5 million inhabitant are not Russians and surveys showed a broad majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine from the time before the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy, which was responded by Russian diplomats to international forums, would give to the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate own trade agreements and external relations and so the Kremlin de facto control of an area to give, which connects the Russian national territory with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">Five months ago the annexed peninsula in the black sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and a historical coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostov area in Russia and Crimea is beyond that rich at mines, factories and foundries, which manufacture important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested with his speech to the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - was to consider additives for condition, with which the respective areas larger control of their finances and the status of the languages is granted.</seg>
<seg id="18">But its conception of autonomy seems to stand for their armament and goading Moscow on in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, is accused.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of Putin last request of Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders after eye level followed after a further penetration of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tank penetrated over the before peaceful region along the Asow sea into east Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists supported by Russia transferred in the coup, which is according to fears of Ukrainian police officers the first step of a campaign for the assumption of the strategic coastal region up to Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason substantial civilian and military preparations started, in order to fasten Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500.000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow entrance to the peninsula Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke a former Soviet republic, which is independent for 23 years on Saturday with a meeting of the European Union-guidance in Brussels and asked urgently for acts, in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="23">“We stand shortly before one point, at which it gives no back more,” warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of strange troops and hundreds strange tank are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit did not decide concrete actions, the guidance required the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to go in effect with a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw themselves from their positions into Ilowajsk, after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated in order besieged last week into the Donezkregion, separatists to support, said Colonels Andrij Lysenko, Sprecher of the Ukrainian national safety and defence council reports on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who were included by the Russian idea in Ilowajsk, exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been imprisoned taken one week ago in Ukrainian area, communicated Lysenko on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="7">It can get over the small muscular strain there easily, particularly it the participation in 8th cycling on large Feldberg in favor of the club “assistance for cancer-ill children” (Frankfurt) also personally a valuable realization brought.</seg>
<seg id="8">A great thing.</seg>
<seg id="9">“I know now that I can do that - great!”</seg>
<seg id="10">Small short break on the way in the applause curve?</seg>
<seg id="11">No, if I had stopped, it would be out been…</seg>
<seg id="12">As many tormented themselves Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler city council, the 718 participants yesterday in the early rope to mountains and arrived the exhaustion close, but happy on the plateau.</seg>

<seg id="16">Also it drove through the distance in a slide, like also Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city Oberursel, which had made itself common with Frank Grüneisen on the way.</seg>
