The original name "Schützengesellschaft fir Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the club was founded on 21 March by the association for "social entertainment through exercise in the Zimmerstutzen- and Kleinkaliberschießen."
In 1937, the Nazi Party had led to the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964, there were 19 young men who, on 30 April at the inn Lukas, raised the "new" nearby "Berngau" Berngau.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the association as a Schützenmeister through a difficult period of time, in which it was primarily a question of finding a spring and installing the Schießbetrieb.
Already in autumn 1965 the nearby started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the Rundenwettkämpfen.
In the following years, the sport shooters, which have now been organized in seven teams, were in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The Vereinsrekorde prequel each year and the magic limit of 380 rings was achieved for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the spring "Leininger" no longer satisfies the requirements of a modern marksman, the then Vorstandschaft under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future domicile in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis."
After a work of 2700 hours on May 8, 1988, the priest Strasser for the new Schützenräume was awarded the church blessing.
One of the great highlights in the history was certainly the 44th 44, connected with the solemn consecration of the new Schützenfahne in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the nearby celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böllergruppe was established in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl was Böllerreferent.
A big challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bayerischer Böllertreffens 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the club members have modernised the rooms and the Schießanlage in the Berngauer Hof in the past year, thus bringing them up to date with the latest technology.
