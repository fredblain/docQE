Matthies means: Highest time to the great Connect
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to turn our cosy home into High-Tech-Schaltzentralen, our columnist Bernd Matthies is playing with a very familiar electronic accessory.
While I write this here, I have a look at the spiral that connects the listener with the phone, and I think: Boah, like retro is this?
But there is a thought: if the cable would not be, all the listeners would fly in the house in a very short time, and that would be much more retro.
In any case, is the ekeltronischen (ekeltronischen?
No, typos: electronic) sector is the rule that the world novelty of today's electronic waste is bought - outdated.
And who, for example, still has a CRT in the living room, who simply says that he is fundamentally opposed to television.
Why are these considerations?
Because the Andr√§ngen of the Ifa at the radio station this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who used the washing machine and CD player blindly, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread with incomprehensible Expertensprech before him: "Connected Home, wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises the press office.
Yes, is it?
What are we talking about with people who apparently voluntarily spread this kind of Quark?
After all, for about 20 years, it has been the case that we are going to have to interconnect our house.
In order for the yoghurt itself to be reordered so that we can tell the alarm on the Maldives that it burns in the office.
And would it not be wonderful if we came from the office out of air conditioning on our early arrival...?
Yes, but this requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: we lift our wristwatch, say "sucking!" - and at home the Staubsaugroboter goes off.
It is misleading.
Everything boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods blur," Rum an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphones, the purchasing sends the weather forecast and the " shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but that is not good because we are stuck in traffic jams.
We also know from everyday practice: if a Farmers device is really badly needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral on the phone will survive the next Funkausstellungen.
