George Webster for Hotelvergewaltigungen in Naim and Pitlochry
A man stands for the rape of women in two hotels in court.
George Webster, 28, received the indictment at a hearing from the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of having raped a woman in the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked them while they were "unconscious, sleeping, and no consent could signal."
Webster is also accused of having a second wife in the Golf Hotel in Naim in the Highlands of Scotland on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing for 17 November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
