The Höllenjahrzehnt of the survivors of Beslan: ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children of today are still suffering.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan in Beslan.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, in which 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, the start of a new year, captured and killed, this seemed like the skull of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in revulsion, and then turned surprisingly into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell is going to haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now ravaging Ukraine - and in the children as they die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed in the attempt at the NGO sports bruised
She was photographed by the Russian religion Dimitri Beliakow and famous, when she tried only in her underwear, in the NGO sports bruised after a mine exploded.
Aida, after her mother, has been was, now 40 years old.
Both were deemed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I was going to run my life, but I could not," said Aida then.
My legs were told.
I stood up and climbed again to search for my mother.
A soldier brought them in safety.
After a series of operations she felt completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid I have to work again.
Some shrapnel are still in my knees.
Their aim is to become dentist in order to help the people, as they have been helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it did not break me," she says tear.
"That is what happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I always go into the sports hall to remind me of those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about this in other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together as we were small, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I am thinking of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of it, although the memory of each year will be somewhat weak.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I look online at the photo of me, as I see in school zurückklettere, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to something that is not happening again.
The boy, who fled through the bullets, in the opinion that his mother was dead.
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school for 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the poor of his mother Tamara.
As Native he said: "Mom told me, I should lie down when there was an explosion and keep their hand."
After an explosion he thought it would die.
She said to him: 'Run.'
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a little infant, took it at hand and fled through a bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who joined his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said: 'I could not save them'.
In fact, Tamara was tripped up outside and with Beinverletzungen in the hospital, in turn, in the assumption that their son died.
After her reunion she said: "I wept for joy.
I could not believe.
He ran and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), to receive from the then Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion.
"This horror takes you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is pale in my memory.
I still know that I am using all my once.
But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me.
"I am not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the court, and who have not done it out.
We never say that they have been killed or dead.
We say that they have remained in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London, especially to the toy, where I was able to choose everything I wanted, and the ride in an open car.
But now he is afraid of place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends have suffered.
This horror takes you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me of it.
"I am sorry to all those who suffer from the barbarities," said Damir, who worked last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I would like to help.
I want to go one day to the police and hope that they will take me next year at the Schulungsakademie.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood have been killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and walk, and this stillness lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London wept when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and their support.
She was grateful Blair and her Foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and you just say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting of her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and she wanted to once all local Russian restaurants.
I remember, as he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot on her and she ran away and played with him.
And that was only one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and supported us.
She said: 'I always think that this world has not become better in these 10 years.
War is now continuing in Ukraine, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are exactly children like ours.
I think that for many of the war is part of the news that they hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else.
I simply know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can not stop feeling this.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or furious at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he does not like to remind him, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go into the sports hall and ignite candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember, as he sometimes put on the sofa, the face of us turned away, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I still remember, as he did all his weapons and other Militärspielzeuge, Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I woke up after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with all the parts of the body.
I was absolutely certain that my little boy in this hell could have survived.
"I remember that I was Sudanese-born," Damir, Budapest, Budapest ," but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it and he is away.
And so the life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Sverdlovsk Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible image after the siege to the symbol of the Beslan ordeal has been seen.
Comfort: The Beslan-Überlebende Sverdlovsk Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Sverdlovsk
His blutüberströmtes face was frightened when he ran his life, while Chechen terrorists beat his classmates.
His picture was one of the most emblematic symbols of the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a health care professional, had sacked him for his first day of school before she rushed to bring her older son, Vladimir to the University.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there for three horrible days alone," he remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Sverdlovsk managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no single day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We do not think it is long ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days keep me busy.
Nobody will ever forget that, I promise you.
intruder: The image of Sverdlovsk (left) was one of the most of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Sverdlovsk wanted to go to school this day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I just knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Sverdlovsk in San Marino.
Sverdlovsk does not like the picture, and it is hidden at home in the bookshelf.
I understand this, but I also mean that, thanks to this image, people throughout the world feel our pain.
Sverdlovsk says today: "It is important that this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we have ever experienced the truth.
People are constantly investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world will become a little bolder.
"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so what happens?
Ten years have nothing to do with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and had a fear of every day.
I thought to my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That is why I always go into the sports hall when 1 September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old Kindheitsfreunden.
It is difficult for me to go into the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I do not feel as a victim, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I am not ashamed.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will be surgeon.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to become a soldier, but my health was not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Sverdlovsk Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist.
A miracle: Sverdlovsk Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and was sitting next to the bomb, which was fastened on the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It really is a miracle that he has not been killed.
"We feel as if it were yesterday," says Sverdlovsk, who wanted to go to the FSB, but who could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It is still with me, it is not what I left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can " t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005 - in the year afterward - was the first and only time that I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return again and do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
survivor: Sverdlovsk Fanijew today, with a photograph of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop.
My pain is incredible and I wear it every day with me.
My friends know that I do not like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about the school.
I think it is a good thing.
I should be careful with my wounded knee, but I can now run well.
But because of my health I was not able to study at the Geheimdienstakademie of the FSB in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have my documents, also the medical submission and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been here for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not be aware of this and, of course, they should not suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.
I will go to the celebrations.
I know that Sverdlovsk will not go.
It must be much more violent for him, because he was there and I do not.
I waited at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and here in Beslan all of them have been drawn.
It remains in us.
Sverdlovsk is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that if something is to.
He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot take part because of his knee.
He has been operating on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.
I would say that he has overcome the horror of 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors have been killed in the siege, and this only reinforces my pain.
I have lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries around the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It is hard to accept that life will continue, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and many have been killed.
If we can only use all of these rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Aljona Tskajewa, 10
The baby, which has so far been carried in safety by a security specialist.
fascination: Aljona Tskajewa is brought into safety by a Russian Spezialeinsatzkommando (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was worn in the poor of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists left them, but in their savagery they kept their 30-year mother, the 10 Sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the sports.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father, Ruslan, has been married since then, and with his new wife Svetlana a little girl named him after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbours.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
