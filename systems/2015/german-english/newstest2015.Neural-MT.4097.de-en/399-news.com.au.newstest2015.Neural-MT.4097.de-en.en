Genetic disorder Often wrong
One British says that she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years that it would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she lived only a few years after she was diagnosed with another illness.
It was actually suffering from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth-Krankheit (CMT) - a group of ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that wrong is a frequent problem with people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle, an unsafe gear and curved toes.
The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms are worse.
As Rodgers 13, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (IAs) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child I knew I could not do the same thing as the others.
I was constantly falling and everything took me longer.
I could never ride with the other children rollerblade-riding or skateboard and was often done in school because of my way to go and run the.
Rodgers said that in the age of 13 years after several operations to discharge their tendons and stretching their feet their records ways, when their doctor had left the room and read that they suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-Gesellschaft," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and shocked to panic.
I thought that I would be with 18 in a wheelchair and dying with 25, and in between slowly losing all my abilities.
I made all of this with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said she was 17, she became aware that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and inquired of her doctor.
He stood up and hugged me and said, "my love, I do not think you have that, otherwise you are already in a wheelchair."
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, the CMT was detected.
"When he explained what was CMT, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness-Monat to draw attention to this disease.
