China denies Hong Kong " s right to Regierungswahl, protesters swear retaliation.
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach probably spurred the long announced protests in Hong Kong " s business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People " s Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all not candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said or Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That is not what Beijing had promised.
People have lied to the residents of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of China " s decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People " s Congress, said that admission of public nominations in the elections to the Hong Kong government would be too messy.
Since 1997, when Britain handed over China " s control over Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to allow the inhabitants of 2017 to choose the Regierungsvorsitz.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also makes it clear that China " s leaders remain firmly in the hands of a tightly controlled by Beijing.
According to a new clause, only candidates, with love for the country and love for Hong Kong, are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most violent protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for a number of years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial sector if Beijing does not permit a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy-Central-Anh√§ngern were gathered in Hong Kong in a few hours after the announcement.
In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned them in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In a Online-Mitteilung, the organizers shared that the movement "the occupation of the Zentralbezirks only had to be considered as last resort, an action that will only take place if all Dialogchancen are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to have to say that all Dialogchancen have been exhausted today and the occupation of the Zentralbezirks will definitely take place.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and it was on Sunday before the government building tightened security measures, including police forces and barricades.
The unrest is accentuated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
It is also growing that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticised the demonstrations demonstrations, because they risked the business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak could cause major economic damage, depending on how many people are involved and how long they continue," said or Regine Ip, who has been criticising the movement for a long time.
We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China " s state-controlled media also recently reported about Hong Kong " s activists in Hong Kong as a Western subversive agent.
In this summer, activists organised an unofficial referendum on the rights, in which 780,000 people took part - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest Demokratiedemonstrationen in the history of the region.
