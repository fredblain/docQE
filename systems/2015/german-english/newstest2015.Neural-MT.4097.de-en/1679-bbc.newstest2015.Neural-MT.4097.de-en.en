Kenya registers officials to curb "Geisterangestellte"
Kenya has begun to register all state officials in order to delete "Geisterangestellte" from the government's payroll.
Employees who did not register in the next two weeks would not pay more, was a Regierungsmitteilung.
The government is suspected that thousands of people will still be left out of the public service after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service at his office in 2013.
At a test at the beginning of this year, it was noted that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost to payments for "Geisterangestellte" and other abuses.
The government assumes that salaries will continue to be paid to accounts after a person has died or leaves the public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at Identifikationszentren in the next two weeks to ensure that their data is recorded on biometric registrations, has been reported in a Regierungsnachricht.
All those who did not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the communication continued.
"By doing this, it is essential to rationalise the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and clearing up the payroll at both levels - the" Geisterangestellten "is eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Kabinettssekret√§rin in the Ministry of Decentralisation and planning.
