It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to finish my career in the national team, "said the World Champion of 2007 on his Facebook page.
It is therefore a record of 167 friendlies and 576 for Germany in the international retirement.

There are some other verschleißbedingte complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year I realized that I could control my head, but my body could not be fooled, "explained Glandorf in the interview the magazine" Handball Time ."
For a comeback, it would only be available in absolute emergency.

I must also say that, after my long hospitalization in 2012, I have become quite humble as far as my health is concerned.
After my career I would like at least to be able to go some way.
