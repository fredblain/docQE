Putin calls for Kiev to include "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with eastern Ukraine.
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Russian media coverage on Sunday that the Ukrainian government suspended the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskow, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that, under the control of the separatists, the region of eastern Ukraine will become a part of Russia, but that its status with Ukraine must be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin " s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, is in line with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the beginning of the riots over five months ago: help for the separatists of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia, rather than with the West.
In an interview with the state-run television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian campaign to recapture the territories of the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the "Novorossija" or "Khadjibey," a term that is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26 Okt. and during the civilian communities in the territories held by separatists, are hoping for immediate peace talks "in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to engage in extensive talks immediately, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the Staatsstatus of the Südostukraine, in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin " s reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, 'because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine'.
The clarification of the "misinterpretation " of Putin " s remarks underscored Russia " s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct Annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy mentioned by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that links Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important seaport and historical coastal area.
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Petro proposed in his speech on 7 June that Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should take into consideration the constitution, with which the relevant areas are given greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in stark contrast to those of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement to Moscow is being reproached.
Putin " s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the Separatistenführern on an equal footing followed after another incursion of the rebels last week, after Russian troops and tanks invaded the Azov region along the Azov Sea to eastern Ukraine.
The separatists, supported by Russia, took over in the coup, which, according to fears Ukrainian security, is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a Stahlindustriehafen with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are nearing a point where there is no return," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership required the proposal for further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force in the event of an escalating escalation of nuclear power.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian columns and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donezkregion to support the besieged separatists, said Colonel Footballers 1898-1976, Speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Alpine-wide on Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk, were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers, who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian-style territory, divided 1898-1976 on Sunday.
