Ebola - The epidemic is affecting West Africa " s economy
The in West Africa is also a heavy blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are distancing themselves.
The devastation of West Africa is a serious blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely added the region.
Some international companies are already distancing themselves.
"The Ebola is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic," judge by the head of the African Development Bank, Donald fragile-state.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It is a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells on the second largest market in Liberia " s capital city.
On the market only, who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit hardest by the virus, on its own, the fever fell victim to more than 600 people.
Recently, health officials said that the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, thousands of others stuck.
Foreign companies are recruiting employees
Companies in the resource-rich countries are running their business.
Foreign companies like Arcelor " s Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers are also reacting: only few merchants left their homes to obtain supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, they are rotting, among other things, for the export of important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is going to be scarce.
"People will always travel less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the West African economy.
The man, for example, who normally goes on the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population will therefore feel the consequences of the epidemic directly and acute: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, stocks of staple foods such as rice are dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage the environment - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies shun the area for a long time, says Philippe Bibliografia of the French Think Tank Iris.
What is important is how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression is that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest, "warns Bibliografia.
The disease also interferes with the state budgets of the Member States.
The disease also interferes with the already strained national budgets of the countries concerned.
The credit rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets are heavily burdened by high spending on the health system, and in addition to the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
Keeping are the effects already in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola-FÃ¤lle have been diagnosed so far.
It is true that the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has so far not been affected.
But, elsewhere, many people remain in fear of contagion at home.
Reservations can also be made in hotels.
