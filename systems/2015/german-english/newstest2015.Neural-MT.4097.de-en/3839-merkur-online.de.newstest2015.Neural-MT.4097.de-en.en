Merkel speaks Power Word: toll is going to be "quite clear"
Now the Chancellor is clearly committed to this.
It is not, however, a licence for all the complicated details.
Christian Democrats in the Christian Democratic Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are increasingly sceptical about the Christian Democratic Party (Christian Democrats) and the CDU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken, after continuing opposition from her CDU, a power station for the introduction of a toll.
"To make it quite clear: you stand in the coalition agreement, and they will come," said the Parteichefin on Monday after meetings of the CDU-Spitzengremien in Berlin.
But, for the time being, Merkel did not lay down on a detailed model.
In the black-and government program, "certain parameters" are called.
stand Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now working on it.
The NRW-CDU, however, is insisting on its' no 'to a toll on all roads.
Merkel, as well as Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch채uble (CDU), has been constructively engaged in the deliberations of a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked about other possibilities to enable more private capital for investment in infrastructure, including the broadband.
"At the end of the day, the" Spiegel "report was left behind, and his house is looking for a new concept to remunerate Autobahn-Investoren with tolls - after the election in 2017.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer then warned against the lead minister in the Cabinet against the lead minister.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never went out of all circles and highways to charge," said the North CDU-Landesvorsitzende.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again on the subject.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverb채nden Baden-W체rttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are fears that a toll will affect local border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had asked for the Mautkritik of the CDU Koalitionstreue.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said leader Bernd Riexinger of the "Neue Osnabr체cker Zeitung" (Monday).
"With the toll failed the minister," Dobrindt wants to introduce a toll on all German roads to start 2016.
However, 8kn car owners may not be subject to additional charges according to the agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
The model must not, however, discriminate against foreign drivers under EU law because of their nationality.
