town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer has an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt " s twin sister in China now wants a brewery, and is also hoping for a Flug-Direktverbindung between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Vize-Parteisekret√§r of the South China metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week when visiting a the in his city.
Time and again, the official official of China " s ruling Communist Party came back in the course of the call to address this concern.
Guangzhou, which is also called the canton in Germany, is one of China " s richest cities,, Li.
That is why people also have the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.
The Hessen Platzeck Thorsten Paparazzi, who led the German Politikerdelegation, said to the host that he will become a partner in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does not need much: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou.
This joie de vivre is already in the hands of Mr. Li, he flatter the host.
As a result, the official official from Guangzhou with Paparazzi, but with a red wine that was served to eat.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to Germany.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed according to German purity law.
More commercial transactions
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a Flug-Direktverbindung between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
'It would be worthwhile', the local councillors were convinced.
"The business dealings between our two cities continues to grow."
At the moment, travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, sued Li.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for flights.
The Vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.
"This is a very good idea," replied Paparazzi - the Chinese vice-minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded approvingly.
Neat partnership
The portico-ed Vize-Parteichef of Guangzhou hopes that he will be able to visit Frankfurt in the next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this role.
He came into office only this year after his predecessor had been promoted as a result of corruption charges.
The local leader, Wan Wan, also had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being rigorously enforced by Head of State Xi Jinping.
The new leader, Li Yiwei, had worked in front of his the for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before joining Guangzhou, he worked as a propaganda in Fujian, where the VW Beetle built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen town-twinning activities.
The connection to the Guangzhou remote is one of those that are maintained by both sides, for example, with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25-year anniversary of the Sino-German connection was celebrated.
The China metropolis on the Dynasty is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic clout.
Next year they want to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, reported Li.
