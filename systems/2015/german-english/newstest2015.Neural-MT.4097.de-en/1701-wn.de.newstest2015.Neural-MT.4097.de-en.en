The scandal surrounding the Kunstberater Helge Achenbach will be on trial for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs to Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-Gründers Theo Albrecht, call for 19.4 million euros from Düsseldorf and two of his companies that are in insolvency proceedings.
This was announced on Monday.
In the Complaint, it is said that, when buying works of art and vintage cars, Berthold and Berthold Albrecht have calculated higher than actually paid prices.
As a result, the agreed commission would have been higher.
Achenbach has bought a total of 121 million euro items for Albrecht.
