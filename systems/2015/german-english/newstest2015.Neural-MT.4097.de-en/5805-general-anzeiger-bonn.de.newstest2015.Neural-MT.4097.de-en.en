New Radom in Berkum: Wachtbergs landmark
That is not the case at all.
On the other hand, the integrated part is waiting to be used in the prominent building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the Weltraumbeobachtungsradars TIRA the casing, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size, however, remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the Kappentausch
The upper part of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell will be set up.
As far as the weather is concerned, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
