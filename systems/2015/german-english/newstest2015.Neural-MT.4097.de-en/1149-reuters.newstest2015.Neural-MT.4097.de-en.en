Judges are temporarily stopping to force all Abtreibungskliniken in Louisiana to close down.
A the stopped on Sunday provisionally the implementation of a law in Louisiana, of which lawyers say that it would probably have led to the closure of all five Abtreibungskliniken of the state.
This measure, which was raised by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to enter into force on 1 January, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a Patientenaufnahmerecht at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles for their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being, while they are requesting such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law, while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote federal John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within a month, a hearing will be set for judges to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abtreibungsbefürworter welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said that doctors have so more time to obtain Krankenhauseinweisungsrechte.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a treacherous law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chair of the Center for reproductive rights lodged in the name of three of the five clinics of the state to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment was also extended to doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for Einweisungsrechte.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not.
key of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close down, were stopped by a federal on Friday.
Abtreibungsbefürworter and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, are saying that doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.
abortion believe that measures are designed to protect women's health, although some also welcomed the effects of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who carries out abortions in Louisiana has Patienteineinweiserechte, divided the center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop abortions, this doctor would no longer be able to carry out the operation, as the group said.
In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not penalize doctors for the execution of abortions, whereas their applications would still be pending.
