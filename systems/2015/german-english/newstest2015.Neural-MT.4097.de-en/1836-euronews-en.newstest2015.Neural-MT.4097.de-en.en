Not all children in Ukraine return to school.
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There he reported waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The Septemberfeiern were not held in any school.
The sky is not peaceful throughout Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian Peoples' Front, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slawjansk, who visited Jazenjuks daughter, spoke to Russian.
We hope that peace will finally prevail here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in the hands and giving their teachers flowers.
