Production in the Eurozone on a 13-Monats-Tief
The increase in production in the euro area slowed down in August at the lowest point in the last 13 months, so a closely observed study.
The final economics Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50,7 in August, after a stand of first in July.
An indication of 50 gives an expansion.
New orders went back and factories were experiencing break-ins at a time of rising tension between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures take place before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets are expecting a clear plan from the Bank for dealing with a reluctant recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could do more in the course of this week to consider a quantitative easing for the eurozone, according to those carried out by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the restraining effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at economics.
The Fabrik-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, it fell in the second largest economy of the bloc, France, the PMI on 46,9.
France remains a problem child, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Note that stimulus in the Schl√ºsselindustriemechanismus Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer resort, are also not reassuring, "said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of the analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI has risen to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chefwirtschaftsexperte at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing that can be said for the Einkaufsmanagerindex of the manufacturing industry in the euro area of August is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are obviously difficult to find life at the moment, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and it is likely that some orders will be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large contracts.
He said that it is' increasingly likely 'that the ECB should eventually embark on a kind of QE, "though we suspect that this will be limited."
