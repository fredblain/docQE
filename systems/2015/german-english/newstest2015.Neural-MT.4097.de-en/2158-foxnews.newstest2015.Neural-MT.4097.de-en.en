4 Tips for Better pictures and Videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a choice of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof waterproof, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a Action-Cam like the A Hero3 + Silver Edition, which are both for about $300.
I recorded these photos at a family celebration with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of $350.
Independently of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.
Control your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery pack and other compartments are closed.
Upload your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and home, with which the exposure time for the otherwise Unterwasserbedingungen is optimized.
And before you jump into it, check the depth of your equipment.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Find in our guide and the ratings for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make NC - because many will not work.
Point-and-Shoot-Kameras have an LCD with which you can compose images, do not normally not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see it under water, and the right Adjustment is a luck.
So you make a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a Reihenmodus with which a series of shots will be made with slightly altered exposure, you can use it.
Remain close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the more you remove from the surface.
If possible, you will remain close to the surface if you take pictures in a pool, a lake or the sea.
This allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice to the country, but it is all the more important because of the poor light conditions.
It is very important for you to work with a Action-Cam: these devices often have a fixed Panasonic, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if you want to complete the whole picture area.
