It was a step in the right direction, when it was cancelled a few years ago.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: who is not the winner, is!.
For example, Albrecht klassenhöchstes Team Torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, but only fünftklassig in the coming season.
In spite of their grandiose Durchmarsches, they remain in the regional league.
The boys and girls of torpedo start in the Niedersachsenliga, as well as the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve are in the new A-Juniors, in the finds there are no Göttingen clubs.
For the ladies the TTV Geismar in the A-Juniors, the Torpedo-Zweite in the finds.
What looks like a better Bezirksklasse, is now the new Bezirksoberliga South.
Here, TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Saat, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the plays, as regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende, in the Bezirksklasse of the TTC II, Rot-Weiß, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the game.
In the plays, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen are running.
The Nine Teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small plays.
Also the Bezirksliga-Staffel of the SCW-Jungen - there is still a torpedo II - is not complete.
In a Bezirksklasse, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the SV are going to the season.
In the first season of the founded founded, the two Göttingen Göttingen will start with the nine teams.
In the West-Staffel are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Gutingi, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the Ost-Staffel, among others, Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen / Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the circle of Osterode, where there are no more Damen-Teams at all.
It is striking that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen Arbeiterpartei has been reached, and here the innovative and man Kreisvorstand will have to think again.
