Taxation of businessmen in the space of Washington is rising with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local authority for business in the country grew slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, so a newly published study last week, and the companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia have paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue from 2012 to $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of business increased by 4.3 percent to 671 billion last year, compared to 3.9% in the previous year, and it was the third consecutive year after the several years of decline in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4.3%, according to the study carried out by the service Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe.
More than half of the country " s tax revenue, 56%, comes from corporate taxes, while 36% of revenues come from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, generates the lowest tax revenue from companies.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is justified in a recovery of corporate profits, say the researchers, which led to an increase of 3.7 by 3.7% this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1%.
While a large share of these profits from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also appears to be the case for Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia have paid more than $10 billion in government and local Immobiliensteuern last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery at the property in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenue, as the US economy is in excess of more than one-fifth of corporate profits.
Businesses in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.
"In Maryland, the following: a large part of real estate, especially in the frontier area around DC, is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that do not pay Immobiliensteuern," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by businesses cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market.
Unternehmenseinnahmen also seem to recover, so the data.
Companies in the region reported about income taxes of $2.3 billion, compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern, the highest amount in the region.
As the trend moves in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses does not grow evenly across all three places.
The road in the district corresponded with 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a subpar tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia, with 6% in all three Amtsbereichen, has the least Unternehmenseinkommenssteuern (in all three there are fixed rates).
The Unternehmenssteuersatz in Maryland stands at Dura-Flange percent and in the district at relatively high Sullivan percent.
A similar study by the US-Handelskammer at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local business taxes are required, and a better environment than in Maryland.
In the study the district was not investigated.
Despite its advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate-tax rate this year from 6.9% to 6%, the same sentence as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5% next year.
If the state continues to reach its Einkommensziele in the coming year, this law could reduce the state " s state monopoly by up to 3% by 2017.
In the meantime, it seems to be better for small businesses in the area of Washington, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, so the recent study.
Corporate taxes, which are paid as a personal income tax by small businessmen - a institutions, after which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia last year increased by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster rate of growth than corporate taxes as a whole.
Researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in overall government spending for the state and local governments by 6.2% in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Nevertheless, the space of Washington could lag behind if the federal government " s fiscal retrenchment has an impact on the labor market in the region.
