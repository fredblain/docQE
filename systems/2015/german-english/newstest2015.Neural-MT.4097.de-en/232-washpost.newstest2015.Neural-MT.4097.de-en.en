Feminists criticize race and Polizeiverhalten
The unarmed teenager was killed at the beginning of this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands high, not shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After three-week protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown noticed the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the playing white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to raising income and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Middle West have increased and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% around the race.
In comparison with the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the suppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant an important change.
"I do not think that in feminism there is a lot of people who speak about the white and the privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt compelled to say something about the events.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they must express this.
For Englischprofessorin Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson " s problems have come to light that black women are exposed every day, but they are not considered as "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partners and get 150 likes from anywhere," said Mitchell.
If I post something about how blacks are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, the race, sex, and sexuality in the history of the US, there is no dichotomy between racial and Geschlechterproblemen.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating the themes neatly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now associate the subjects of race and gender in feminist Mainstreamkreisen, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the flair.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women, such as Susan B. Anthony, analyzed the country in the late nineteenth century and discovered that the fight for electoral law could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They met the decision to stand up for women's rights, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.
When you are reminded of such things, one with power is aware of why coloured women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to compete against the C in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Cruelty.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell is the spate of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - Polizeiverhalten, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists were "catching" with the problems faced by black women for generations.
"Would it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child as seriously as they do with the right to Empf√§ngniskontrolle?" asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, 11636 of Guardian, calling for more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand one of the body's inherent danger - and opinions on race, which are clearly different in public opinion - will lead to change," wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersektionalen feminism, to be addressed in the race, as well as Geschlechterthemen, some of her comments about the grounds in America are perplexed.
Christina Sommer, Researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole cyberfeminsm?" said to The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments on Ferguson are in contrast to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, LSD, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were irritating reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem in the foreground.
After the US-Grenzpolizei almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the CHEEZ-al-PEEN-o of the country this year, the theme of the reform is coming back to the surface - this time as a women.
Andrea Mercado, IESG of We the Together, an organization that mobilizes women for the reform, said that for a reconsidered of the subject as an essential women they only need to publish the stories of the women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of immigrant workers go to male immigrants, the women they accompany are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find an echo in women's organisations," she said.
