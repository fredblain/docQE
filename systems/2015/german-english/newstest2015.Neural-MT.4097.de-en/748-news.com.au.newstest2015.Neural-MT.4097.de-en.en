Teens from the Blue Mountains
TWO young Buschwanderer were brought in safety with the winch, after they had been caught in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man collapsed shortly after Sunday in Govetts in Blackheath on her tour.
Scared relatives called the police at about 20 o'clock, when the two did not return home.
A search from local police and emergency services broke down and the pair was found at about 23 o'clock in the vicinity of the Bridal Waterfalls.
The girl had fallen to the knees and the man was overthrown and had turned his head.
Ambulances stayed overnight at the couple, and they were flown on Monday morning.
They were hospitalized in a stable state with an ambulance in the Blue Mountains Hospital.
