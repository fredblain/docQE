Smart ways to save at Uni-Lehrbüchern
As the cost of Uni-Lehrbücher for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent Matt Schroeder pondered a clever Sparidee.
He invented a Leihsystem for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay the went.
"My Mathematikbuch normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-Keks," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He gave $120.
The Collegeleitung informed the students on average more than 1,200 $per year for textbooks and study, but for the students there were different Kostendämpfungsoptionen.
Online-Läden and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
The renting of textbooks is becoming more popular, so students can use a book for a semester long, often at a much cheaper price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 Universitätsbuchläden, announced that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Polls in the industry show that around a quarter of the books were rented in the College-Buchläden in the past semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased by the Amalgamation National Association of College Stores in Campus-Buchläden.
Here is the multiplication for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are in the Campus-Buchladen.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" Debian Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be taken with the specialist Lehrbucheinzelhändler Chegg.com for $239,99.
Used to buy
If one of the notes of other or normal usage tracks, then used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for $93,49.
Matt Casaday, 25, Abschlussstudent at Brigham Young University, says he spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used edition of "Strategic Media Knova: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Professionals such as Ingrid Bracey, Head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether earlier editions are admissible.
Sometimes the updates for the many are not relevant.
In such cases, older editions can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.
rent
The renting of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and do not want to keep the books after completion of the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform yourself about the provisions of the business in which you rent, including the fines, which may apply for writing notes, underlined or usage tracks.
attention: If you do not return the book, the fines can even exceed the price of a new book.
e-books
Even e-books instead of conventional textbooks are an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in Literaturkursen often find the best offers, because many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineer-scientific textbooks can be very expensive.
Look at each case.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN ISBN for books, because you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order you should check whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery and finally paid the full price in the College-Buchladen.
