In an opinion on the new press, he contradicts statements by the executive director Peer Medau and attested to this "as a Feldherr."
The style of the university is not, that is, in the communication.
For example, the family family had already been informed of the request of the university in the middle of June.
The statement that the plans were only known in July are definitely wrong, "says so.
At the same time, it points out that the plans are not 'Vorfestlegungen or even decisions', but there are 'preferences'.
Also, the extension of the narrow road to the entrance to the castle is less dramatic than that of the Medaus.
It was from a nine metre wide road and is not mentioned.
It goes to the current state at 5.50 metres, which is a metre wide than before, "explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau-Betreiber, that their free and inquire parking spaces in the future will only be used by students of the university, does not want to apply Pötzl.
Zugeparkt is not at all because, as with other public car parks, it has become an intelligent solution.
Thinking to the People " s Villages
The nursery Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and, in front of its door, would have access to the parking deck, should not be affected by the "Hochschulpräsidenten."
Instead, he has to bear in mind that this is not only about the crèche, but also about the residents at the entrance to the transition and the 800 students of the neighbouring secondary school.
So it is a question of much more than the special interests of Mr Medau, " says Pötzl.
Whether the critique of the Elternbeirats of the crèche, with the expansion of the road would be lost to a "the few natural stains of Coburgs," the reader can decide for himself ."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Bauamt Bamberg, wants to inform the town councils about the constructional development of the University of Applied Sciences by 2020 and to address the importance of new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week.
As a result, access to the new parking deck is not going to take place via the Campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the campus.
In this way, the narrow road should be extended to approximately one kilometre length.
According to the estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles every day.
From the side of the city you have not wanted to comment on the project.
