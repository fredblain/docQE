Tony Stewart suffers an accident at the race track.
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended roughly halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.

Stewart drove his damaged car in the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that his 14-k√∂pfiges team is disappointed, but now concentrates on the race at the coming weekend in Richmond, Virginia.

We drive to Richmond and hope that we will be able to do it better.
Stewart sailed earlier on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch in a wall and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I am today with quite good hopes of a good result," said Johnston and added: "It simply did not work."
