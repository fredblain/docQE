Under this Treetop
A powerful tribe we showed in our Rätselaufgabe of the Herren "My piece of the lucky luck" last Friday.
Several of these trees are still in the district, the illustrated copy is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A uneven footpath leads up to the 600 year old oak.
It is about fields, Basaltsteinhaufen and Basaltsteinmeeren.
A little bit below the quarry of Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, where it stands.
Vital is the natural monument, it towers over the other trees of the surrounding area, and is reminiscent of an American giant with a circumference of over eight metres.
A small Buddha on a stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But, despite intensive research, there were only references to the raspberries.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has also consulted the Bischofsheim archive and asked older people from Unterweißenbrunn to know what explanation it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the Ziegenhirten have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously cleared and stones meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the weary, exhausted by the rise, will have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows it is actually grazing again.
The area has also been explained to the Grafenegg of the Reserve, Schneider has continued to find out.
When you enter the Steinansammlungen, you should be careful, because the sun basalt is also a popular place for Kreuzottern.
A footpath leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, but it is hidden.
Further directions are signposted, the direction of Hochrhön and an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
A Wasserburg that is sought in our next task, however, is rarely found in the height.
The reflection in the ditch already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district that could fit the Gebäudekonterfei.
Where is our "piece of happiness happiness"?
