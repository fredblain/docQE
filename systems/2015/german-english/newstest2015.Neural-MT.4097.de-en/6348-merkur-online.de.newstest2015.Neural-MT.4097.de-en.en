Will the Burgvereine again be pulling in the same direction?
Last but not least, there was a dispute between the two warring factions.
Now the board members are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, took the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden.
At the same time, the points of view of the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and possible reconstruction have to be dealt with in a very different way.
Now the two camps are moving: there should be discussions on a common approach in the near future.
This is confirmed by the Vereinsvorstände Torsten Stockaryd (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on demand of our newspaper.
"I phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit together," says Stockaryd.
In his view, all the members of the two clubs could pull together again in the future.
As a result, progress has been made more quickly.
While the Burgfreunde, the late Richard Dimbath, until the last time a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain massif, has been in the forefront for the Burgverein, the "development und Erlebbarmachung" of the terrain is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, has been very pleased about the call.
He has been in charge of the Burgfreunden since Dimbaths death.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in the middle of September.
At the moment, the club has a population of about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we have left the Portland out of respect at first," This "was necessary to think about how to proceed.
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current the within their group.
There is still no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself," he does not want to stand, because he has his domicile in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Toelzer wanted to participate in the project "but very much to work."
The various points of view on reconstruction will probably remain in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.
Through a high participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist.
Piffl: "I was also sceptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time I am more and more convinced that it makes sense to advance the project.
There is nothing else there.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU, pass and potential sponsors.
"The idea of reconstruction does not, therefore, want me to simply throw it overboard," he hopes that the Burgverein will perhaps be slightly moved on this point.
Their goal, first to document history, is "is important and good."
After that, it could be there.
