Housing prices have experienced the strongest growth rate in seven years, showing a widely quoted index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, so the RP-Daten from Monday.
This increase is due to the increase in June, July and August at 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice as high as the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research of RP Data, Tim BardCon, told Sydney and Melbourne to drive a two-part market.
The figures of RP data show that house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1% last year, in Melbourne, by 11.7%.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane, and Darwin, where average prices rose by five and six per cent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra has been hit hard by the cuts in government spending, and where prices rose by only 1.4% over the year.
Mr BardCon said that, with the US rebate, there will now be an increase in the real estate market for the next few months, which would be subject to a real test of the market.
"If you consider the constantly high rate of the, a generally fast the and the constantly low Zinsumgebung, it is likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
