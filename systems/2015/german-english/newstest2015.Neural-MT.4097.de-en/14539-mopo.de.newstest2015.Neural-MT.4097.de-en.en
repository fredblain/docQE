Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the Neul√§nder place, refugees are now accommodated in tents.
The head office for refugees in Harburg is bursting at all seams.
Now the the have set up three tents of the Red Cross.
The Bezirkspolitiker have been informed only briefly - they are not enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck-Aktionen continue to arouse public concern and give the Bezirkspolitikern no opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, group chairman of the Greens in the Harburg Bezirksversammlung.
Their party demands that the administration Harburg are currently making unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for overcrowding in the initial are the onslaught of help - and the fact that the authorities are not able to provide enough places in social.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
