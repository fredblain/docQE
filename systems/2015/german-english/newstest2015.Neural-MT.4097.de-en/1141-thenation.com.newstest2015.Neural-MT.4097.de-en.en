Returning to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"As trade unions die, the Mittelklassejobs," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and vice president of the Progressive Caucus Congress in Congress.
That is why I proudly present the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities of discrimination because of the organisation of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich.
The addition of the national anti-discrimination law, in order to create an opportunity for discrimination against vulnerable workers, in order to sue a civil court in order to sue justice - and to obtain compensation or compensation - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislative proposal suggests is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once again encouraged countries all over the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember this country, democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognised that 'the rights of workers in association and common negotiation and action are guaranteed.'
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would make fascism Adolf Hitler replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize themselves and their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly the: "The right to establish associations to safeguard and improve the labour and economic conditions of each individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it are null and void; targeted measures are illegal.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Human Rights Commission, which was drawn up by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors have a guarantee that 'everyone has the right to form trade unions to protect their interests or to join them.'
For generations, Americans have been forced to accept that labour rights are human rights.
When this country consulted other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government authorities - must be protected.
With these rights in America under attack, it is indeed very wise to recall the American ideal, which is why the working population must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement has not reduced the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable increase.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History reminds us, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has made in the past and the promise of democracy.
