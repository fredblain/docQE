Perry from Texas says that unworthy Tweet was not authorized.
A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a belittling remark about the democratic Bezirksstaatsanwältin, which is at the heart of a criminal offense against him because of abuse of authority.
The Tweet was deleted later and replaced by another of the Perry user account, the previous one.
Just a tweet has been sent from my account, which was not authorized by me.
"I do not accept the tweet and have deleted it," said it in the later news.
Mr Perry did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets of Perry have been the official user account, it was not clear who actually served the feed.
In the previous Tweet, a two image of the Bezirksstaatsanwältin of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was condemned in April 2013 for drink-driving.
Perry put a veto against financial support for their offices, as they refused to resign, leading to a charge against Perry - which could be a presidential candidate for 2016 - before a Grand Jury held this month in Austin.
The text of the tweets reads: "I am not always drunk with the triple permissible permitted... but if I do it, I accuse Mr Perry when he ausplaudert it."
I am the betrunkenste in Texas.
Lehmbergs's office was not responsible for the investigation of the Grand Jury against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry is not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His illustrious team of lawyers applied in the case of the judge who was responsible for the prosecution and argued that the law dealing with the longest-serving governor in the history of the State of Texas is diffuse.
Perry stopped 7.5 million $public funds to the Public Integrity Unit of the state, based in Travis County, and identified in cases of state corruption in Texas, as Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint on the part of a public complaint.
Perry official user account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After graduating from the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy in 2012, Perry went to speculation that he will stop by making a tweet of a photograph of himself near a lake x11, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
