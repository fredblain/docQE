After election in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl is NPD-Verbotsverfahren
In view of the vez of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl has spoken out in favour of an end to the current NPD-Verbotsverfahrens in front of the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the current proceedings against the German Federal Constitutional Court should come to an end.
"The NPD is worse off than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landeschef in Baden-Wuerttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung."
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me more likely to be the result of a political battle against the NPD and not before the Constitutional Court.
At the time of the vote on Sunday, the NPD had failed spectacularly.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party was a failure in 2003, because, at that time, the GÃ¶rus was also in the hands of informers.
In December 2013, the Federal Council filed a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
Federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
