"Schweine-Haus" in Ipswich stands for sale.
The image of a house was removed from real estate agents, when it became clear that there was a big pig that made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
One of the details was a picture of the living room of the house - to which a pig belonged to his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo is the pet of the owner.
"The photo was published erroneously and has now been removed," said a spokeswoman of the company.
In the expos√© of the house, Connells described the former Islet as a "unique one-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The at caused interest in the social media, as some wondered if the pig was included in the purchase price.
