Amazon buys minutes for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON confirmed what was reported on Monday morning: The online - and the, and a lot of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst minutes for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because nobody expected a takeover of minutes, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as though the sale of minutes to the Google blog of Google for a cool billion was decided, and cooperation also seemed natural.
minutes, which was founded only three years ago as broadcasting, was launched as a general Streamingdienst - a version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their favorite games in games, a "Youtube for live games," so an insider.
The Twitch-Schnittstelle.
And "let's play," a Videogenre, in which knowing-better (mostly older) games give a painting of Geheimwissenschaftstheater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It's just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe minutes, so the news that YouTube minutes wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook of an established Technikunternehmens that buys a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not materialise, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment is this statement by Fusion-Band belonging, president of minutes: "We have chosen Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision and they want to help us get faster."
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of minutes.
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to ride sports than watching it, it is hard to understand the attraction that comes from watching other games instead of taking the Kontrollkonsole into the hand.
It is one thing to watch a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning, while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a Spinner as he shot 20 times in Call of Duty.
You could see all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are Ego-Spiele, so it can be a good recipe for headaches without your own control over the Blickperspektive.
I admit that the sweeps, in which the Roger Bannisters of our Elektronikzeitalters play all the games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game or video game, its Twitch-Kanal is probably not so interesting.
But what are sceptics like me already?
minutes is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is hard to imagine that minutes will be integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, such as YouTube minutes could easily swallow.
But minutes has something that every company would have liked: thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of minutes, belonging, said, Amazon and minutes "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinkage, not yet - schluck - as sport.
