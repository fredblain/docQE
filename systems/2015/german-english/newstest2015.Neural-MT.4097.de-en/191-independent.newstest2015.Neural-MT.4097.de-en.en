Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons's novel novel about Love and the letter "J."
They were zerflossen, so it was best to describe them, they were slowly moving on like a carton that was left in the rain.
Occasionally he said a woman that he was too serious, tiring, intensive, distanced himself, and perhaps a little bit from.
And he shook his hand.
He knew he was.
He was the, as in hedgehog, yes.
The last casualty of this Stacheligkeit was a recent affair, which was more promising to ease the solitary boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even a certain satisfaction.
Ailinn where was a Mount-Trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She was accompanied by an older accompaniment to the south, who held Kevern for her aunt, and who inherited a land in a humid but paradisiacal valley with the proper name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leak, in the baths were still spiders, nudibranchs had left their traces on all windows and believed that they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant Elin.
It was like the house of a children, both menacing and seductive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, the novel "J" on the posthumously for the It Award 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting in high grass and had an unusually warm Frühlingsnachmittag with Ailinn published in the broken in, who provided the land with soothing music and soothing messages, as the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer that his father liked to listen to closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their innate aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was properly banned - simply not played.
It has been successfully obsolesziert, as the word obsoleszieren.
The general taste, which decrees and rules never managed, and how people in books choose the Vom-Tellerwäscher-zum-Millionär-Memoiren, cookery and romantic, they chose the ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day Kevern began to play a imaginary piano and in a grob-komischen serenade Ailinns great feet to sing.
Ailinn did not understand this.
"This was a well-known song of a pianists called Roll Waller," he explained it and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That had always done his father to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had been playing with his own father, he told him.
If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very funny game at the time, and it was not very funny now.
He knew that it was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not banned directly.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "if" in life.
The people wanted to be very safe at the beginning of a melody where they would end.
It is the same mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically fact mind.
Although he was ten years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from the half collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least he didn " t have to explain that Roll Waller was black.
In her age, she probably could not remember a time when singers was not black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conforming society meant that any element of this society would be grateful to the principle of Gruppenbegabung - grateful to the fate of spared.
People with afro-karibischer origins were suitable for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were treated with the task of ensuring that no family remained without functioning 7629.
What was left of the Polish community was concerned about the sewer system; what was left of the Greeks, crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly as WHAT HAPPENING WAR, IF ES HAPPENING WAR WAR from fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, fearing that the flames would devour them as next - had Labneh- and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, thought and became depressed.
Each one of his abilities.
As she had heard only ballads, it was difficult to understand how the abusive words that Kevern had just had been able to be played.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really insulting," said Kevern.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the illusion of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the huge kohlartigen leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father have such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on the lips in her presence.
She thought, anyway, that he was a little strange.
"It appeared funny," he said instead.
They shook their heads and blocked Keverns.
There was nothing else to see on the whole world than her ungekämmtes bleak hair.
There was nothing he would like to see.
"If you say," I mean it without conviction.
But that does not explain why you vorsingst me.
She seemed to be honest.
Are my feet too big?
He saw it again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Do you hate?
Of course I hate you.
That is only the silly song.
He could have said 'I love you', but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think me," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That sounded wrong.
It had to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because he, like his father, did not have the soothing charm needed to control the savagery inherent in jokes.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn where was red and rose out of her deck-chair, threw the console around and buried the wine she had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein, so drunk was not an excuse for him.
In their excitation, they seemed to tremble, like palm-branches in the storm.
"And your Dickkopf is precisely why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except that I am not.
She was sorry, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she turned against him.
Did they say that he would beat them?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke out here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with still thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE WAR, who had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from tavern to pub, always willing to raise the hand against a woman who refused or derided.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown a thick fist if they were not farewells!
You only canoodle - kissing was the most frequently used word for an erotic appeal between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous ballads from the console - they only canoodle and then beat.
According to Keverns, this was an unnecessary refinement, as the kissing itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn where gave him a sign through her body.
He rose from a deck-chair like an old man.
She also felt bleiern, but the fury of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They did not know.
She saw him as he departed - just like a room on the upper floor, her companion to him - a man, complaining through something he had created himself.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back, embarrassed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was it a sight that she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before the day before?
When she was back alone, Ailinn looked looked on her feet.
Several years before the recent incidents, town Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic VIENNA researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body for public sentiment, gave a short talk about continued violence at low and medium levels in precisely the parts of the country where their reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much still needs to be done," wrote it, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that led a thousand wars, and most of them won, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human kindness has seldom been felt historically despite the soaring church between hedgerows.
But some properties stand out as ineradicable.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion that it continues to awaken.
The population cries to hear sentimental ballads, intoxicated in stories about Reinvigorated difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but still does not only maintain the former harshness the rural communities as well as our urban fabric, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious Streitsucht at home, at work, on the streets and even on the squares.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor when he had read the whole report.
I suggest you read less novels.
town Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also ask: are you atheist?
"I think that I do not have to say," replied town walnut.
Are you lesbian?
Again, town appealed to her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
feminist?
Again silence.
"I don't ask this," said Luther Rabinowitz, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.
This is a labour-intensive workplace.
We serve a unprejudiced society.
However, certain types of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable, may distort results, as you have presented them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things that you call 'deceitful' and 'raw' may be interpreted by others as well as an expression of power and vitality.
If you continue on the herumreitet, WHAT HAPPENING IST, IF ES HAPPENING IST, as if it had happened yesterday, would mean to take the country its essential vitality.
town walnut looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head repeated a LED-Schriftzug in Flamingorosa the advice that the had given to the country in the last quarter-century or longer.
smile to their neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, take advantage of your phone, speak your phone, talk to you, tell you, you listen to, you agree, excuse yourself.
Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand what you want," replied town walnut with a calmer voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing more than that we are not as effective as we are deceiving ourselves.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves in the process of repeating the mistakes that were made at the very first of the WHAT, IF ES HAPPENING.
This time, however, it is not the others in which we forget our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz shaped with the hands a pyramid.
In order to indicate a warning message.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as" errors "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far, when you say that they have left their "rage" and their "distrust" to "others."
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we are talking about the past, such as the protection of the present, not of 'us' and 'other'.
There was no "we" and there was no "other."
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.
"If we are honest with ourselves," durst town release, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not accuse anybody.
Whether it has been done badly or well, what has happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say anything more - we are in agreement on this.
And, just as no blame must be allocated, it must not be repaid if such a repayment is appropriate and if there is a way to wipe it out.
But what serves the past if we do not learn from it -
The past serves us to forget them.
If I may say something about this, I should like to say something about this.
Luther Rabinowitz rocked his pyramid.
"I will consider her report," he said and dismissed it.
On the next day, when she went to work as usual, she was ridden by a motorcyclist who, like passers-by, was in a kind of "brutal fury" on the footpath.
Chance exists.
