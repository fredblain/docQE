<seg id="1">Moving-recollection of the very American ideal the industrial law as human rights </seg>
<seg id="2">The congress representatives Keith Ellison and John Lewis brought in a law proposal in order to establish the organization of trade unions as some civil rights. </seg>
<seg id="3">"So as trade unions die, die also the middle class jobs", Ellison said, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy chairperson of the Progressive Caucus in the congress. </seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore I present proudly the employee authorization law together with the civil rights icon John Lewis. </seg>
<seg id="5">This epoch-making law gives workers the same legal possibilities in the case of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions as with the case of other forms of the discrimination - and stops strengths in a so antiunion-related way stopped. </seg>
<seg id="6">The supplement of the national industrial law law, around a possibility for exposed to a discrimination workers to the organization of a trade union representation to create, in order to complain before a civil court around justice - and in order to receive compensation or punishment money - a reasonable and necessary initiative is. </seg>
<seg id="7">But it is not a radical initiative with security - anyway not according to American standards. </seg>
<seg id="8">In fact the best kind and manner for the sense of what Ellison, Lewis and the further sponsors of their bill suggest is the connection back for a very American idea. </seg>
<seg id="9">In spite of the setbacks to whom the trade unions were misfired in the last years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states in the whole country - Americans encouraged once countries in all world to acknowledging stretching and stopping industrial law. </seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time which millions of Americans still remember, when this country mentioned democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the union right in a breath. </seg>
<seg id="11">When Japan filled the United States after the Second World War, general Douglas Mac Arthur and his stick encouraged the country to adopting a constitution which is supposed to guarantee that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy. </seg>
<seg id="12">In full consciousness of that, that the workers and their trade unions during the creation of a new Japan took a role, they used a language that acknowledged explicitly that "the rights of the workers to union and common negotiating and action are guaranteed." </seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States fill after the Second World War Germany, general Dwight David Eisenhower and his stick pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would provide that that the fascism Adolf Hitlers would be replaced by a strong democracy. </seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact, that the workers would have to organize, and should rise their voice in the new nation, the Germans inserted a stipulation that testified explicitly: "The right to base unions around which Work and economical conditions to safeguard and to improve is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade. </seg>
<seg id="15">To curtail it agreements that restrict this right or are aimed at that are zero and vain; measures being aimed at that are unlawful. </seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship about the International Human Rights Commission from which the General declaration of the human rights was projected as it was taken over in 1948 of the United Nations as a worldwide agreement Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form trade unions to the protection of his interests or to join them." </seg>
<seg id="17">Since generations Americans accept the basic premise, that industrial law human rights are. </seg>
<seg id="18">As this country other countries in this case advised as one can shape civilian and democratic societies Americans declared that the right to the foundation of a trade union must be protected - and on this trade union may participate in collective negotiations as an equivalent significant partner with enterprises and government places then. </seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights is turned out into America under bombardment it in fact very points, to make clear the American ideal again, accordingly the working population the must be right, to unite and hearing to be provided with in a free and open society </seg>
<seg id="20">How pastor Martin Luther King said Jr ones fifty years ago: </seg>
<seg id="21">A splendid instructor is the history </seg>
<seg id="22">Now they all know that the labor movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but extended it. </seg>
<seg id="23">Through the increase of the standard of living of millions of people work created a market in wondrous way for the industry and raised the entire nation to inconceivable production levels. </seg>
<seg id="24">Those ones who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the history preserves it </seg>
<seg id="25">The history remembers, and we should also do that. </seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition the industrial law as human rights - and the enlargement of the protection of the civil rights as protection against discrimination during the creation of employee representations - is for a long time overdue. </seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which made America big in the past and kept the promise of democracy. </seg>

<seg id="1">Richter stops law temporarily, that all abortion clinics could force in Louisiana for the closing </seg>
<seg id="2">A US federal judge stopped on Sunday the conversion of a law into Louisiana, from which attorneys say that it would presumably have led to the closing of all five abortion clinics of the state, temporarily. </seg>
<seg id="3">This measure which was raised by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June for the law and is supposed to come into force on 1st Sept. would force doctors who carry out abortions to gaining a reception admission right near a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice. </seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the judge means, however, that the doctors keep on being able to carry on abortions legally temporarily while they are applying for such right. </seg>
<seg id="5">"The complainants can weiterarbeiten law-consistently while they" are "making" an effort for the attainment of these rights, wrote federal judge John deGravelles in his judgment. </seg>
<seg id="6">Within a month a hearing is scheduled for the judge in order to cause a lasting decision for the law. </seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion proponents welcomed the decision, the youngest one in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors would win so more time in order to attain hospital installation rights. </seg>
<seg id="8">"Meant "the present decision that the women escape" in Louisiana" "an insidious law that wants to take their health and their rights from them", Nancy Northup, president and chairperson of the center for reproduction rights that had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state in order to stop the law, said. </seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the judgment applied also to the doctors from the two clinics which had not followed the complaint and applied also installation rights at it. </seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is to one of 11 states that enacted similar laws at which courts have declared recently such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitution </seg>
<seg id="11">Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remained in the state for the closing, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday. </seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion proponent and the American college of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association say matchingly that installation rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors. </seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents object that that the measures are used for the protection of the health of the women although some welcomed also the effects of a closing of clinics. </seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor that carries out abortions in Louisiana, proceeded above Patienteineinweiserechte, informed of the center for reproduction rights. </seg>
<seg id="15">If all remaining doctors are forced in the state not to carry out any abortions anymore, this doctor would not carry out the operation anymore for fear around his security said the group. </seg>
<seg id="16">During their argumentation against the judgment representatives of the Louisiana state said that they would not punish any doctors because of the realization of abortions during whom requests for Patienteneinweiserechte would still be pendant. </seg>

<seg id="7">The researchers examined the medical care of the women more than seven years. </seg>
<seg id="8">Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman with the case of the diagnosis, the type of the ovary cancer, existing Vorerkrankungen as well as the social and economical status influenced also the survival chances. </seg>

<seg id="10">For those ones that lived in rural and remote regions of the state the mortality risk lay during the study about 20 percent higher than for those ones in town areas. </seg>
<seg id="11">Although the study did not examine, why outside of the city living women with higher probability at ovary cancer died, Dr. Jordan presumes a late diagnosis and the lacking access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for that. </seg>
<seg id="12">"This illness is handled best by gynecological oncologists, and these are to be found mostly in bigger cities", she said. </seg>
<seg id="13">In spite of the improvement of the telemedizinischen services in order to counter the distances with something she suggested a strengthening of the service of doctors flown in as possible remedy in order to give specialists the possibility to look after women more thickly at their place of residence as well as treatment programs for people outside of their region </seg>
<seg id="14">Dr. Jordan said, that the study showed a bad long-term survival rate independently of the geographical status with women in the ovary cancer and underlined it the need for better treatment and provision strategies. </seg>
<seg id="15">The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia. </seg>

<seg id="10">But for my club I would like to be available healthily also in the next years, for that longer regeneration pauses which the current double load does not approve are necessary. </seg>

<seg id="4">His father that died when henry 19 was worked in a factory and their relation was restricted. </seg>
<seg id="5">Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, the partial one is based on an imaginary conversation with his father and arose from the series on radio 4. </seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with lively melodies. </seg>
<seg id="7">But henry had to plow through some difficult childhood moments. </seg>
<seg id="8">He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father. </seg>
<seg id="9">It was heavy to know it </seg>
<seg id="10">One never saw his face, heard only his voice Stop with the crash. </seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister in peace. </seg>
<seg id="12">Move! </seg>

<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with it </seg>
<seg id="16">A majority of my life it this serious type in the corner that read the newspaper was. </seg>
<seg id="17">Recently henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at times of his father, nevertheless he gained an insight in how the life liked to have been for it </seg>
<seg id="18">It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, verraucht, deep stygische labyrinths with flame punches and smoke and a lot of soot. </seg>
<seg id="19">My father simply lay down formerly into the tub and then one could hear it slowly how he started singing because it could wash the foundry of themselves. </seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked around there, I realized that he had done that for years in order to bring the food to the table, and my respect for it became greater. </seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless Henry grew up as a child without love evidence of his parents. </seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you". </seg>
<seg id="23">Only when my mother was feeling bad by the end of their life, we began, "I love you, I love you, I love" to say "you". </seg>
<seg id="24">Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could split up the love which he had missed as a child. </seg>
<seg id="25">You could stop once with that "I love you"? </seg>
<seg id="26">Nevertheless stop embracing me! </seg>

<seg id="36">That contributed to their death. </seg>
<seg id="37">When I therefore very much, very became overweight and symptoms of diabetes showed, my doctor said "You must be radical. </seg>

<seg id="44">It The comedy of the errors, and then Fences of August Wilson followed. </seg>
<seg id="45">That is another experience than the Sitcoms and comedies which filled his busy working life. </seg>
<seg id="46">He began only with 16 years, when it worked in a factory. </seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered it on the stage, than he imitated persons and wrote to New Faces about it </seg>
<seg id="48">His TV career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on televison for a quite long time." </seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession. </seg>
<seg id="50">I did not have to become tall only before the eyes of the public, but learn also from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient Witze-Erzähl-Maschine while I was being a star through the television and that was really difficult. </seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 with New Faces </seg>
<seg id="52">There his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show had, a light conversation program in which the people painted themselves black henry performed his Comedy there more than five years. </seg>
<seg id="53">That was very unpleasant to my family. </seg>
<seg id="54">I wanted somehow that it would never have happened, however, I do not regret that I did it. </seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I cooperated in giant projects and learned how one deals with a large public. </seg>
<seg id="56">But this "prize-winning light column of the British watching television lasting for years was also a "grotesque parody of black people." </seg>
<seg id="57">Through the introduction of figures, that the British black culture both mocked as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties on an alternative Comedykreis. </seg>
<seg id="58">The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went in 1984 on the air, and in the nineties it was among other things in the Comedyserie Chef as the chef de cuisine Gareth Blacklock! known. </seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising documentaries, TV-series and reels of film shaped his next decade, but according to his BBC-series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought himself: "What you do as next, Len, because it feels so everything when you bring only the time for that or kick a little on the place." </seg>
<seg id="60">After that a documentary series came for radio 4 with the title What's So Great About...? </seg>
<seg id="61">The first consequence turned around Shakespeare. </seg>
<seg id="62">On Shakespeare I was downright allergic. </seg>
<seg id="63">I had never learned something about it correctly in the school and mainly held it for a domain of the middle class, whiteness, in tights and a cabbage in front in that. </seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore I had great fear of that. </seg>
<seg id="65">All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it once. </seg>
<seg id="66">Do not make it bad if you do not know which you talk about. </seg>
<seg id="67">Take a few of the words into the mouth, and then you will understand, why we all Shakespeare so dear. </seg>
<seg id="68">Henry listed 20 lines from Othellos of last speech for the documentary and it was enthusiastic. </seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could create that. </seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if somebody would have put me on the head correctly at last </seg>
<seg id="71">"For that it works, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, investigates a little. </seg>
<seg id="72">The tests were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it. </seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success. </seg>
<seg id="74">You splint a car accident expect, and that did simply not happen. </seg>
<seg id="75">And soon it occurred in the comedy of the errors. </seg>
<seg id="76">I was sudden in the national theater and I could hardly believe it. </seg>
<seg id="77">Over there there was a moment when I thought "Oh, you changed." </seg>
<seg id="78">There were a technical error and henry felt instinctively, that he must maintain the public. </seg>
<seg id="79">"A small voice said to me "You must bridge 10 minutes now, while they are repairing the computer." </seg>
<seg id="80">Instead of this the stage conductor announced that the idea would go on as soon as the problem is solved. </seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God". </seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for that. </seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave that to somebody else. </seg>
<seg id="84">You play in a play, therefore bleib in your role." </seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre </seg>
<seg id="86">To learn the text for Fences was pretentious. </seg>

<seg id="90">Therefore I persevere. </seg>
<seg id="91">I really love that. </seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a test room </seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has, however, the head of one comedian - our conversation is from humorous outbreaks pulled through, while he is imitating persons again and again. </seg>
<seg id="94">I decided on not doing any Stand-up-Comedy because I think that this kind of the immediate satisfaction of a hall is somehow dangerous to full foreigner. </seg>

<seg id="2">44 years it was in the teaching profession, of that 23 as headmasters. </seg>
<seg id="3">From this time Manfred Richter knows many stood Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as pupils. </seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were sometimes unconventional, however, always taken from his aspiration to see the human being in the pupil. </seg>
<seg id="5">The Schneekoppe is the best known mountain of the giant mountains. </seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his home. </seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/north Bohemias, today Trutnov. </seg>
<seg id="8">Already with 14 he was interested in the teacher profession after four years of high school. </seg>
<seg id="9">A year after that the Sudeten German ones were expropriated. </seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour the family had to leave their house. </seg>
<seg id="11">After some months in a warehouse it went in 1946 to Bavaria - in the good freight car carriage. </seg>
<seg id="12">So it brought judges into the upper-Franconian depression village. </seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher education occurred in Bamberg. </seg>
<seg id="14">For this purpose Manfred Richter six times weekly had to run ten kilometers to the next railway station, go going with the railways according to Bamberg, there three kilometers crossways through the whole city to the school and in the evening back. </seg>
<seg id="15">After two months Manfred Richter got a sleep occasion in a red-cross-home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 schoolmates in a sleep hall. </seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951 it did teaching position candidate the first and in 1954 after three years the second state examination. </seg>
<seg id="17">Since Oberfranken did not have any free teacher place for it he applied after upper Bavarians and came on 1st November 1954 onto the school in Kollbach. </seg>
<seg id="18">The "young woman room" was his first "official residence" in the school building. </seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958 he got a three room official residence in the again built teacher house next to the school. </seg>
<seg id="20">Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school had been solved in Kollbach 1968. </seg>
<seg id="21">Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and in Peter beluga five. </seg>
<seg id="22">From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Peter beluga in the present city hall. </seg>
<seg id="23">When the school association Indian village was based, only still the elementary school stayed in the place. </seg>
<seg id="24">In order to escape a moving-graduation in the now smaller school, the former rector Georg Sigl changed according to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor. </seg>
<seg id="25">However, Peter beluga increased, and so the children and their teachers from September 1982 could get the present construction which was expanded in 1997 after Richters superannuation. </seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the simple generosity of the former mayor Ludwig Götz, that additional on municipality costs a craft room and build 1997 cellar rooms during the enlargement made although that was not subsidy-capable to the guidelines for school constructions </seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", remembered judge thankfully. </seg>
<seg id="28">In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech contribution of a government representative which had answered a paper of a school council on right and justice: "One must never forget the love". Manfred Richter transformed, what it had belonged to there as a young teacher. </seg>
<seg id="29">"One must give the children two kinds: Roots and wings", the today 84-year long one says. </seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to find out: "That does always not succeed". Whether it means only his pupils or just the same his own six children there is not very clear. </seg>
<seg id="31">Always Richters actions were sometimes unconventional. </seg>
<seg id="32">If pupils fought, they did not get a punishment work from it and did not become either the Nachsitzen verdonnert. </seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the municipality Richter had made buy two pairs of boxing gloves and made the two opponents be lined up against each other even if there should be once in this case a violet. </seg>
<seg id="34">For the welfare of the school Richter maintained a good relation to the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as a rector. </seg>
<seg id="35">This convinced the independent judge of that after his superannuation, 1996 at least than last to run for the district council on the CSU list. </seg>
<seg id="36">However Richter was dialed on place six and the CSU joined. </seg>

<seg id="3">Freehold dwellings in the the capital were sought after hot and object of enormous price climbs, what persuaded the bank from England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble to setting upper limits in June for mortgage credits. </seg>

<seg id="5">The property market in London was during the downturn well stationed since foreign buyers rushed towards the capital. </seg>
<seg id="6">According to information of the land-registry the prices went up around 18.5 percent in the town area alone in the last year suddenly, far more than the average rise in England and Wales in total. </seg>
<seg id="7">The average sale prices at Berkeleys private, economical and studentischen offers climbed around approximately a fifth in the lasted year and lay at the end of April around the 423,000 £. </seg>
<seg id="8">A stronger pound made however, real property property attractive in the last months in London for foreign buyers less - some of them were deterred also by the introduction of new real property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible "Villensteuer" in front of the general elections in coming May. </seg>
<seg id="9">The London estate agent Foxtons warned in the last week against the mortgage market report leading also to smaller market growth for April in which sharper granting of credit regulations were presented in the second year half both with the case of the real property sale and with the case of the prices. </seg>

<seg id="12">The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington year went back in the meantime about a quarter for year, according to the broker WA Ellis. </seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless the wish is a blessing to a freehold dwelling in the capital for Berkeley since the due amounts amount to more than 2.2 billion £ for appointment sales. </seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the correct, well planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result also the appointment sales remained stable." </seg>
<seg id="15">In June the enterprise told that it had sold 3,742 new freehold dwellings in the year until end of April - almost a third more than to the highest level 2007 in front of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="16">The annual input tax result changed annually 40 percent onto 280 million £, the turnover about 18 percent on 1.6 billion £. </seg>
<seg id="17">In a communication on Monday in front of the year meeting of the enterprise Mr Pidgley said that the gains would probably comply with the present market expectations for Berkeley in the current year. </seg>
<seg id="18">The analysts estimate matchingly the annual input tax result at 450 million £. </seg>

<seg id="11">The tubes were leaky, in the baths spiders were still, slugs had left behind their tracks on all windows and believed, that all belongs to them, and the garden was with weed practiced grown-up, that looked like gigantic cabbages. </seg>
<seg id="12">It was a garden of full secrets as the house from a child fairy tale, both alarming and enticing. </seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the Longlist for that one stands One Booker price 2014. </seg>
<seg id="14">The short cunning is announced in the coming week. </seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken beach chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had latched themselves absentmindedly into the service console that supplied the country with calming music and calming news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a for a long time forgotten black entertainer which his father had listened to gladly near closed rolling shutters in the house. </seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too large. </seg>
<seg id="17">Due to their ureigenen aggressivity songs of this kind were not played anymore on the console. </seg>
<seg id="18">Not forbidden - nothingness was so correctly prohibited - not played simply. </seg>
<seg id="19">It became successfully obsolesziert, so as the word obsoleszieren. </seg>
<seg id="20">The general taste created, what decrees and rules would never have created, and choose the Vom plate scrubber zum-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and love novels as the people at books, so they chose with the case of the music the ballads. </seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day began to play Kevern an imaginary piano and to record on large feet in a coarse-funny serenade Ailinns. </seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn did not understand that. </seg>
<seg id="23">"That was a known song of a jazz pianist by the name of Fats Waller", it declared her and laid automatically two fingers onto his lips. </seg>
<seg id="24">His father had always done that in order to stop the letter J before his coming from his mouth. </seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between it and his father when it was still small. </seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, so it had told. </seg>
<seg id="27">If you begin a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny. </seg>
<seg id="28">It had not been already a very merry game then, and it was not also now very merry. </seg>
<seg id="29">He knew, which this was expected by him, that was everything. </seg>
<seg id="30">It had to be declared what jazz was. </seg>
<seg id="31">To which ones Ailinn had never yet belonged. </seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was not played even if it was not directly forbidden. </seg>
<seg id="33">The improvising was not more modern. </seg>
<seg id="34">It was only place for an only "when" in the life. </seg>
<seg id="35">The people wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody, where it would end. </seg>
<seg id="36">In the same way the intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="37">His Unvorhersehbarkeit made the people nervous. </seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically expressed intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="39">Although he had become 10 years old without having heard about Sammy Davis junior, knew Kevern a little about jazz of that one half secret collection old CDs' of his father. </seg>
<seg id="40">However, at least it did not have to declare Ailinn that Fats Waller was black. </seg>
<seg id="41">In their age she could not remember presumably a time in which pop singers were not black. </seg>
<seg id="42">Again was valid, no laws or compulsions </seg>
<seg id="43">A consistent society meant, that every element of this society agreed thankful the principle of the group talent - thankfully as the ones spared to from the fate. </seg>
<seg id="44">People with afro-Caribbean origin were suitable through temperament and build for conversation and sport, therefore they sang and they ran. </seg>
<seg id="45">People who came from the Indian subcontinent initially were blessed as of the nature with electronic talent and were looked after with the task of guaranteeing that no family without functioning engineer's order wire unit telephone stayed. </seg>
<seg id="46">What was still remaining from the Polish community cared around the canalization; what was remaining from the Greeks smashed plates. </seg>
<seg id="47">Those ones from the Gulf States and the Levante, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD HAPPENED, IF IT HAD HAPPENED happen- for fear, to be accused of fire poke, for fear even, that they would consume the flames as next - had held Labneh- and revealed to Shisha whistle restaurants,themselves considers and became with the idleness depressive. </seg>
<seg id="48">Everyone according to his abilities </seg>
<seg id="49">Since she had heard only ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words could ever be vertont that had just vorgesungen her Kevern. </seg>
<seg id="50">Music was expression of love. </seg>
<seg id="51">"Those ones are not really offensive", said to Kevern. </seg>
<seg id="52">Except for maybe for people whose feet are too large. </seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never offended somebody, but he loved this song. </seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the treacherous feeling of security </seg>
<seg id="55">The sound absorption of the gigantic cabbage-like leaves could not overcome anything. </seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn did still not understand. </seg>
<seg id="57">Why your father should have loved something like that? </seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, hesitated, however, with laying two fingers again onto the lips in their present </seg>
<seg id="59">She thought anyhow already that it was a little strange. </seg>
<seg id="60">"It appeared merry to him", he said instead of this. </seg>
<seg id="61">It joggled unbelievingly their head and obstructed Keverns view </seg>
<seg id="62">It did not admit anything else on the whole world see, as their uncombed raven hair. </seg>
<seg id="63">There was not Anything which otherwise he would have wanted to see. </seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say it", she thinks without conviction. </seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not declare why you vorsingst it to me yet. </seg>
<seg id="66">It seemed honestly worried. </seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too large? </seg>
<seg id="68">He looked once again there. </seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so directly not. </seg>
<seg id="70">Maybe your ankles a little bit... </seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick? </seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you? </seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I do not hate you. </seg>
<seg id="74">Nevertheless that is only the stupid song. </seg>
<seg id="75">It could have said "I love you", but for that it was still too early. </seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you", he attempted it instead of this. </seg>
<seg id="77">I am a little perverted there. </seg>
<seg id="78">That did not ring correctly. </seg>
<seg id="79">It had been supposed to be funny. </seg>
<seg id="80">If he attempted to be funny, he often in trouble killed himself, because it did not have as his father the calming Charm that one needed in order to control the cruelty inherent in jokes. </seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be also cruel. </seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he of Kevern wanted, that be. </seg>
<seg id="83">In spite of his friendly eyes. </seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons became red and rose from their beach chair, overturned the console and spilled the wine which they had drunk. </seg>
<seg id="85">Elder flower wine, therefore drunkenness was not an excuse for it </seg>
<seg id="86">In their excitement it seemed to tremble, as palm fronds in the storm </seg>
<seg id="87">"And your stubborn person is exactly the reason why I feel perverted drawn to you", it said... </seg>
<seg id="88">Except for, that I am not that at all. </seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry about it both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words as also the fear that was proved in their eyes when she revolted against it </seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think that he would beat it </seg>
<seg id="91">It had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he did not have any doubts that it was like this basically as here. </seg>
<seg id="92">The same gigantic and icy-cold ocean broke to itself here as there at the shore </seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more peevish after THAT WHAT HAD HAPPENED than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, drew from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman, who refused them or verlachte. </seg>
<seg id="94">Stubborn person? </seg>
<seg id="95">Those ones would have shown her a thick fist if she did not look out! </seg>
<seg id="96">You first smooch - Smooching was the most frequently used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote for the meaningless love ballads from the console - with her first smooch and beat then. </seg>
<seg id="97">According to Keverns opinion that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching represented even already an act of the power </seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons admitted a sign to him through their body go. </seg>
<seg id="99">It rose from the beach chair as an old man. </seg>
<seg id="100">She felt also leaden, but the impact of his grief surprised her. </seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world. </seg>
<seg id="102">Nevertheless you hardly knew yourself. </seg>
<seg id="103">She watched to him, as he left - so as from a room in the upper stick their companion watched him during that - a man, burdened by something that he himself had caused. </seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought. </seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for it and men in general, although some their hands against them had risen. </seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from it bent his back, abashed, conquer, without fighting spirit - why that was a sight that it seemed good to know, when they could remember nevertheless not onto an only time, at which she had seen something like that before the present day already once? </seg>
<seg id="107">When it was again alone, Ailinn Solomons looked at their feet. </seg>
<seg id="108">Many years in front of the just told incidents Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher worked on a short lecture on the consecutive power in the task of Ofnow, the nonlegislative monitoring control for the public atmosphere, on low and middle level in exactly the regions, in which to expect their decrease, if not abolition, at the ehesten are been, in view of the money and energy that the extermination of this power had been invested in. </seg>
<seg id="109">"It was done already a lot, and a lot must still be done", she wrote "in order to soothe the innate aggressivity of a nation that led a thousand wars and won most of them in particular in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human friendliness was verspürt seen historical in spite of the church towers rising highly between the rears rarely. </seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties turn out as ineradicable. </seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the church tower, it seems like this, the passion in a the smaller way that it keeps on waking. </seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries during the hearing of sentimental ballads, intoxicates with histories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family lives firmly, however, nevertheless only the former brutality does not hold the rural municipalities just the same as our urban structures do in the hand, but there are also proofs for the origin of a new and insidious belligerence at home, at the job, on the streets and even on the grounds. </seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unhappy tendency towards the exaggeration", thought their mentor when he had read the whole report. </seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less novels. </seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum bowed their head. </seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: are you an atheist? </seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe, I do not have "to say" that, Esme Nussbaum answered. </seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian? </seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme referred onto their right to privacy and refusal of the statement </seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist? </seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence. </seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not ask that," finally Luther Rabinowitz said "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism. </seg>
<seg id="123">That here an unprejudiced job is. </seg>
<seg id="124">An unprejudiced society uses us. </seg>
<seg id="125">However, specific kinds of hypersensitivity that are completely acceptable and praiseworthy at themselves can distort on the occasion of results as you introduced it </seg>
<seg id="126">You yourself have prejudices obviously against the church, and these things which you refer to as "insidious" and "raw" strength and vitality could be interpreted by others just as well than expression of one of course. </seg>
<seg id="127">When one rides out wider on the, WHAT HAPPENED IF IT HAS HAPPENED as if it would have happened yesterday if it had happened means, to take his essential vitality the country. </seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking. </seg>
<seg id="129">Repeated behind his head a LED lettering in flamingo pink the advice, that Ofnow the country in the last quarter century or longer had given. </seg>
<seg id="130">You smile at their neighbor, wertschätzen you you visit their partner, you hear ballads, musicals, you use their telephone, speak you hear, you declare, you excusing too, you vote too, you. </seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence is, the sung word is better than the written one is, but nothing is better than love is. </seg>
<seg id="132">"I completely understand on what you want out", Esme Nussbaum with quiet voice answered, als sie secure was, that their superior to end had spoken, "and I do not say anything else than that we did not cure as effectively as we show ourselves ourselves yet. </seg>
<seg id="133">My concern lies in our recovering ourselves possibly without prior warning at how we repeat the errors that anyway first to THAT WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAS HAPPENED led. </seg>
<seg id="134">This time the others at whom we skip our rage and our distrust are not it, however. </seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz shaped a pyramid with the hands. </seg>
<seg id="136">Around in this way a patience of Job point out. </seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far", he said "if you refer to actions" as "errors which our grandparents maybe or neither committed". </seg>
<seg id="138">You go also too far if you speak of that that these their "rage" and their "Distrusting" at "others" would have let out. </seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be actually necessary, somebody in your position at that remember, that we with the case of the sense of the past as with the case of the protection of the present not speak of "us" and "others". </seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were not any "else". </seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of the disorder that is all which we know. </seg>
<seg id="142">"Of that one if we are honest to ourselves ourselves" dared to throw in Esme, "to have behaved well, "no part of the society can claim. </seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse anybody. </seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it badly or well what happened was done is happen. </seg>
<seg id="145">That was then. </seg>
<seg id="146">More does not have to be said with regard to that anything - there we agree agreed to ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="147">And exactly as no fault has to be assigned, so also no fault has to be paid off if such deletion would be appropriate and if it would give a way to wipe it out. </seg>
<seg id="148">But for what the past is used if we do not learn from that - </seg>
<seg id="149">The past is used for our forgetting it </seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something with regard to that - </seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid tumble down. </seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider their report", he said and released her. </seg>
<seg id="153">On the next day, when it went as usual to the work it was run over by a motorcyclist who had gone onto the footpath, described as passers-by, in a kind of "brutal rage". </seg>

<seg id="60">"I am sorry about it so around all those ones that suffer from the Greueln", said Damir that last week worked as a volunteer in a cloister. </seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so gladly. </seg>
<seg id="62">I want to go one day to the police and hope for their taking me next year at the training academy. </seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, you can imagine that? </seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply not any children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted many months. </seg>
<seg id="65">She remembers lively their journey to London with Damir. </seg>
<seg id="66">The people in London cried when I told our history </seg>
<seg id="67">I understood then how people on the other hand of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support. </seg>
<seg id="68">It was thankful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in the fall 2004 to Cherie Blair and to their foundation </seg>
<seg id="69">I wanted I could call Cherie and simply say to her that 10 years went by, however, myself I me still onto the meeting me it and her husband in London remember, and as the Damir and me has helped. </seg>
<seg id="70">I still remember as Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch gladly and they called all local Russian restaurants. </seg>
<seg id="71">I remember as he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir fired with his water pistol onto them and they ran away and they played with it </seg>
<seg id="72">And that was only a month according to the horror. </seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised, that the Britons in a so inclined way divided our pain and supported us. </seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world did not become better during these 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="75">In Ukraine the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I believe that many children were killed and are still killed. </seg>
<seg id="76">Those ones are exactly such children as ours. </seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many the war is a part of the news which they hear if they are bored or occupied with something else. </seg>
<seg id="78">I simply know what these people feel the whole horror. </seg>
<seg id="79">And I cannot stop with feeling that. </seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing changed, the people want to kill themselves still mutually and that is so sad. </seg>
<seg id="81">Damir became big and is a very gentle and quiet boy, it is not aggressive or furious at all. </seg>
<seg id="82">He does not search for example for revenge it is not overwhelmed by the last Greueln. </seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not remember that gladly, but he has six narrow friends from the class and they go sometimes into the gym and they light candles there. </seg>
<seg id="84">When it was smaller, he suffered from that - I remember as he laid onto the sofa sometimes, turned away the face from us, for hours. </seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open. </seg>
<seg id="86">I also still remember, as it all his arms and other military toys away flung. Damir is now 17, larger than I, good-looking, intelligent and healthy. </seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I was so secure for some hours that it is dead and I would never again see it </seg>
<seg id="88">When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and the hell looked around me around, with parts of the body lying around everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="89">I was completely secure that my small boy could have survived in this hell impossibly. </seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember, that I called out to him, "Damir, run, run away", however I was also so secure that he had not heard me. </seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard it and he ran away. </seg>
<seg id="92">And so the life, different than that of many others, for us goes wider. </seg>

<seg id="95">Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, to the right a picture of Georgij today </seg>
<seg id="96">His face covered with blood was drawn from fear when he ran around his life while tschetschenische terrorists were shooting down his classmates. </seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the schockierendsten symbols for the barbarism of Beslan. </seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped it off for his first school day before she hurried loosely in order to bring their older son Wladimir to the university. </seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my small boy remained alone there for three terrible days", she remembers. </seg>
<seg id="100">Not very alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were killed all. </seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgij created it, survive. </seg>
<seg id="102">The nearer this date moves, the heavier it is, to think of that and to talk about that. </seg>
<seg id="103">There is not any single day, at which we do not remember this tragedy. </seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is long here, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days follow me continuously. </seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget that, I promise that to you. </seg>
<seg id="106">Insistent: The picture of Georgij (to the left) was one of the schockierendsten of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (to the right). </seg>
<seg id="107">I remember, that Georgij wanted to go so gladly on this day to the school. He said he wants to embrace his teacher. </seg>
<seg id="108">I knew first that it was at the life when I saw it on televison. </seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgij in San Marino. </seg>
<seg id="110">Georgij does not see the picture gladly, and it is hidden with us at home in the bookshelf. </seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also mean, that the people in all world thanks to this picture our pain feel. </seg>
<seg id="112">Georgij says today: "It is important, that something like that can never again happen. </seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever find out the truth. </seg>
<seg id="114">The people examine such tragedies again and again and never find out the truth. </seg>
<seg id="115">And now they examine the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="116">Will we find out ever what caused it? </seg>
<seg id="117">This world becomes something terrible. </seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand as that is possible, because if you ask to the people, nobody wants a war, therefore as happens that? </seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years are not anything at all with the case of such pain. </seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years, around it one to forget little in a small way. </seg>
<seg id="121">It attacked my health and I still feel it. </seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it became better. </seg>
<seg id="123">I went later again in the year 2004 to the school and had every day of fear. </seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed. </seg>
<seg id="125">For that I always go into the gym when the 1st September comes closer. </seg>
<seg id="126">I want to mean my old childhood friends toll express. </seg>
<seg id="127">It is heavy for me to go into the gym, but I must do it. </seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as a victim this history is now a part of my past. </seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I do not pity myself. </seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on. </seg>
<seg id="131">I finished this year the school and go to a medical college in Wladikawkaz. </seg>
<seg id="132">I will become heart surgeon. </seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was a training in the army. </seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to become a soldier, but my health did not approve that. </seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen. </seg>

<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was during the siege caught to feet of a murderous terrorist, but it managed to survive. </seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege it was caught in the gym and was next to the bomb which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist. </seg>
<seg id="140">It is really a miracle that it was not killed. </seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it as if it have been yesterday", says Georgij that wanted to go to the FSB as a secret service officer, but could not do this because of his sanitary damages due to the siege. </seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, it is not anything which I have let behind myself. </seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and the people say that children can deal with bad experiences easily - I must say that is not right. </seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after that a little better in fact, however I cannot forget it. </seg>
<seg id="145">And I would be forgotten gladly. </seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only times, that I went again into the gym. </seg>
<seg id="147">I lost the consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="148">I will return never again there and you do not ask to me please, to show you where I was in this famous picture. </seg>
<seg id="149">Survivors': Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of themselves in the hospital after the siege on the laptop </seg>

<seg id="151">My friends know, that I do not think of that gladly or talk about that and they did not ask me ever for the school. </seg>
<seg id="152">Physically I am fine. </seg>
<seg id="153">I should be cautious with my hurt knee, but I can walk now well. </seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health I could not study at the secret service academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg as I wanted. </seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents also the medical ones sent in and they answered, that it is not possible. </seg>
<seg id="156">The animals were my second passion, therefore I went onto the veterinary institute. </seg>
<seg id="157">I have two years there already behind myself. </seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats up to cows". </seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never report my children about my experiences. </seg>
<seg id="160">About that children should not know anything and they should not suffer it as a matter of course either. </seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain leaves me never. </seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse, if the anniversary comes closer. </seg>
<seg id="163">I will go for the ceremonies for the memory. </seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgij will not go. </seg>
<seg id="165">It must be still much more vehement for it because it was there and I not. </seg>
<seg id="166">I waited at home for it and could not help. </seg>
<seg id="167">I am God so thankful that it was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn </seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us. </seg>
<seg id="169">Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in it </seg>
<seg id="170">It is heavy to accept that when something so Unfair happens to one. </seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sport, but he cannot participate because of his knee. </seg>
<seg id="172">It was operated on multiple, he cannot run, but not do any sport. </seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he overcame the horror to 50%, but one can completely never overcome that and forget that. </seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow us. </seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that intensifies only my pain. </seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people who I knew well and who were expensive to me. </seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the biggest present that God could do to me, however, my heart cries around the killed ones. </seg>
<seg id="178">I know about families in which new children were born, but also about Witwen who never again got married. </seg>
<seg id="179">It is heavy to accept that the life goes on even if one does not want that. </seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw it in the hospital. </seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see what in the world goes on - wars in other regions </seg>
<seg id="182">What do these people fight for? </seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill themselves mutually </seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very much near to our country and I can almost not believe that. </seg>
<seg id="185">We were formerly a friendly country, as it can be that we fight now? </seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am secure that in Ukraine already many children were killed and still many are killed. </seg>
<seg id="187">If we grasp and could throw out only all these rebels - as far away as only possibly. </seg>

<seg id="193">The terrorists made her go, but they held up their 30-year old mother, the 10-year old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym in their cruelty. </seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos </seg>
<seg id="2">If you liked to make photos or videos underwater gladly, there is a selection of devices. </seg>
<seg id="3">The most economical option is a waterproof Point-and-Shoot, as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an Action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver edition that to have both for about 300 $ are. </seg>
<seg id="4">I received these photos at a family celebration with several cameras which are available all for a price of less than 350 $. </seg>
<seg id="5">Independently of the outfit there are a few rules for the best results. </seg>
<seg id="6">Control your outfit twice. </seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, you assure, that the battery chamber and other compartments are thick locked up. </seg>
<seg id="8">Put your camera also on the photos or videos which you want to receive. </seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene and photo modes with which the exposure time is optimized for the dim underwater conditions. </seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, you check until which depth your outfit is operative. </seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet. </seg>
<seg id="12">Search for digital cameras in our purchase leader and the evaluations for traditional and waterproof models. </seg>
<seg id="13">You do multiple photos - because many will not bang. </seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-Shoot cameras have a LCD, with which you can compose pictures, Action-Cams usually not. </seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to notice this underwater, and the correct framing is a matter of luck. </seg>
<seg id="16">Therefore you do many photos </seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a row mode with which a series of photos with slightly changed illumination attitudes are done, you use it. </seg>
<seg id="18">You remain near the surface. </seg>
<seg id="19">The light becomes dramatically worse the wider you leave the surface. </seg>
<seg id="20">If possible you stay therefore close to the surface if you do photos in a pool, a lake or the sea. </seg>
<seg id="21">Through that you can bring also more color into your photos; the deeper you go, the little color you become see. </seg>
<seg id="22">Approach close to the objects. </seg>
<seg id="23">That is a good council also ashore, but it is the more important underwater because of the bad lighting conditions. </seg>
<seg id="24">It is completely especially important if you work with an Action-Cam: These devices have often a firm wide-angle coverage lens which means, that you thicker onto your objects must, if these are supposed to fill the entire picture frame. </seg>

<seg id="3">Among his patients, so his wife remembers, a MI6 employee was that had to live from tortures with the disastrous effects. </seg>
<seg id="4">Lawsone knew that the diagnoses and illnesses are important to the doctors while the handled ones are being occupied with something very else mainly: Pain. </seg>
<seg id="5">One day in the year 2007 he was, however, that one whose ordeal began. </seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel myself", he wrote in May this year. </seg>
<seg id="7">I had picked myself up difficulties. </seg>
<seg id="8">While he was fighting with the flu-similar symptoms, he noticed that it did his wife Juliet reproaches impatiently. </seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything more gladly immediately than later", he noted down. </seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, lawsone completely felt ungewöhnlicherweise and without reason worries. </seg>
<seg id="11">Something lay in the air. </seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague for carrying out a X-ray examination of his breast. </seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago it had been in the French alps for the skiing. </seg>
<seg id="14">There was the result of the X-ray examination </seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from Mesotheliom, an incurable cancer, that the pleura attacks, therefore the skin cladding the lungs. </seg>
<seg id="16">As with the case of most cancer illnesses the exact trigger is to be determined mostly heavily. </seg>
<seg id="17">While for example some smokers are falling with lung cancer ill, all Lungenkrebserkrankten were not formerly smokers. </seg>
<seg id="18">But Mesotheliom is different. </seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fibre material that once was regarded as "Miracle material but meanwhile was recognized as fatal </seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us Mesotheliom is an illness that can ignore as easily. </seg>
<seg id="21">Finally asbestos is a product of the past. </seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous asbestos type was not used in Great Britain since the 1960th years more than the industry committed itself voluntarily to not using this anymore. </seg>
<seg id="23">Also, where it was still used, only people worked in certain branches directly with the material - plumbers, building workers, carpenters and dockers for example. </seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial dangerous material from another time it today hardly yet seems to be alarming. </seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is inappropriate. </seg>
<seg id="26">Great Britain, it seems like this, experiences today the climax of a Mesoltheliom epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths through Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world. </seg>
<seg id="28">With in total 2,500 deaths per annum so many people die twice of this illness than at road accidents. </seg>
<seg id="29">Annual numbers of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and probable future deaths in Great Britain </seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we experience the fatal effects now although asbestos for years is illegal (In 1999 all asbestos types were forbidden) that one is that a Mesotheliom develops first after decades. </seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of the Mesotheliom is not open former worker of the construction branch restricts. </seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is frequent still, in the houses available, in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools, in which we learn and the businesses in which we shop. </seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class bars financial borders professions or age. </seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, of the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter. </seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament Buildings are asbestos-hot. </seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals in which nevertheless we are supposed to become healthy were defined already as initial stoves of this fatal carcinogen. </seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old. </seg>
<seg id="38">He was not also a plumber. </seg>
<seg id="39">It was difficult for him in fact to imagine where it could have come possibly with asbestos in contact. </seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found it out. </seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if in the tunnels at the Guy's an amount of asbestos were available to hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote. </seg>
<seg id="42">All - Students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels. </seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many will stand my contemporaries at the same illness? </seg>
<seg id="44">It could answer this question unfortunately at least in part. </seg>
<seg id="45">"From the four doctors that were trained at the Guy's hospital, and that fell with Mesotheliom ill in the last five years" he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one that still lives." </seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will fall ill still? </seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with Mesotheliom in the age of 48 years. </seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17th February of this year, he was 55. </seg>
<seg id="49">That was an unusually long survival time. </seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months according to the diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="51">The illness ends always fatally </seg>
<seg id="52">We can repeat therefore only lawsones question: "How much of us will fall ill still"? </seg>
<seg id="53">The leading expert of Great Britain to Mesotheliom, professor Julian Peto, accepts that in between 1870 and 2050 in total 90,000 will have fallen victim to the illness if the asbestos epidemic will probably come into Great Britain for the succumbing. </seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them do not have any presentiment at the moment yet, that they will die so. </seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy </seg>

<seg id="57">In June this year's Marks & Spencer gave for example too, to have stopped Janice of All fahrlässigerweise asbestos. </seg>
<seg id="58">It worked for nine years for the chain, of 1978 to 1987 and was responsible above the clothing department at two locations - one of them of the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street. </seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Only 18 years was to all than when she began their activity at M&S. </seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in the twenties. </seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this thing, she says, "I had heard by Mesotheliom never yet I did once really not know something over asbestos yet. </seg>
<seg id="62">I would never have thought that that affected me once. </seg>
<seg id="63">There are only few people who know a lot over asbestos. </seg>
<seg id="64">Fact is, that the concept asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals. </seg>
<seg id="65">The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure that makes the material resistantly and flexibly. </seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six of them were used in the building trade. </seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotil, also than white known to asbestos, the asbestos found today by far most frequent is in buildings. </seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof plates, slabs, tube isolations, storage water heater isolations, even for brake linings in cars. </seg>
<seg id="69">It is less fatal than other asbestos forms are, nevertheless is regarded, however, as "a great health risk" with possible death consequence by the EU and the WHO. </seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous is, however, the brown asbestos (Amosite) and that blue asbestos (Cape asbestos). </seg>
<seg id="71">Great Britain was once the world-largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts presume, that "it clear, however indirect tips for this being a main reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten gives </seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was stopped asbestos in the Flagshipstore in the Oxford Street, London, Alamy </seg>
<seg id="73">Maybe Janice of All Of It did not see himself as typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto indicates that their history is not unusual under any circumstances. </seg>
<seg id="74">He presented a study of the concerned persons in which it is represented that "an essential part of the Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the house was presumably caused by asbestos contact in the environment." </seg>
<seg id="75">A majority of these contacts is based according to his statement on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings. </seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as if nobody can assume to be secure </seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, who examined the palace of Westminster, shows, as people also in the heart of the government, unknowingly the material would be stopped could </seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 Goddard told that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of the parliament with asbestos whose fatal fibres could be swirled up by something so harmless as "strong air movements" were contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="79">Parliament members are accused frequent to see to their own interests, however, here it looks as if the opposite would affect to. </seg>
<seg id="80">While the management office of the Parliamentary Work Service was insisting on the Westminsterpalast receiving a "clean health certificate", meanwhile it is undisputed that 1 billion £ of amount of work must be found over several years in order to renovate the parliament to modernize the electrical installations and that asbestos remove, and that according to the general elections in 2015 the representatives will presumably rather meet in the QE2 conference center seemed likely than on the green banks in Westminster. </seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard-report referred also to "the existence of asbestos not being handled according to the respective regulations." </seg>
<seg id="82">Nobody can know whether this Missmanagement will taste lives. </seg>
<seg id="83">All that one can do now is wait. </seg>
<seg id="84">A person, that the contact with asbestos never exactly is been able to determine Graham Abbott, a general physician. </seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson the 50-year old Abbott presumes, that it was stopped during his work in hospitals the asbestos. </seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital in which asbestos complaints were decided on positively", he says, "however I cannot prove it in my case. </seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all places which one worked on and onto the data. </seg>
<seg id="88">At which it still exactly remembered is the day at the beginning of December 2009 at which he got such kind of fevers. </seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and an operation just carried on late in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had joggling-frost. </seg>
<seg id="91">It came very suddenly. </seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible. </seg>
<seg id="93">I believed not to get the journey anymore home. </seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor Abbott knew, that the pains of the pleura came, the skin around his lungs around. </seg>
<seg id="95">But as Janice of All Of It he did not have any reason to presume a Mesotheliom. </seg>
<seg id="96">It did not go a month to work </seg>
<seg id="97">Amazed doctors made X-rays of his breast and apply Pleurakathether in order to take liquid from the lungs and to test in the lab. </seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints remained, however, without diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="99">His health improved slowly, and it returned onto his job. </seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time the symptoms returned, however, frequent after sporting activity and vehement buckling. </seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011 a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms came in his practice and was diagnosed later with Mesotheliom. </seg>
<seg id="102">But also now Abbott did not combine this with his own case. </seg>
<seg id="103">Finally his patient was some decades older and had worked directly with asbestos. </seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear. </seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 Abbotts state worsened again and his family doctor brought his CT-Scans and X-rays to an expert group. </seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exact two years after Abbott for the first time had felt sick, a probe equipped with a camera into the cave became between the Rib- and the pleura introduced. </seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist. </seg>
<seg id="108">I continue mostly one-times", he says. </seg>
<seg id="109">Honestly said, I had not made myself as many worries at all. </seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worried. </seg>
<seg id="111">There was the result of the biopsy weekdays between Christmas and New Year: "One said to me that it was Mesotheliom." </seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnose Mesotheliom </seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott had appointments with Macmillan-nurses from whom one recommended him to take an attorney. </seg>
<seg id="114">Only now he understood the extent of the epidemic. </seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread especially in big public buildings in which tubes were often isolated with asbestos", he says. </seg>
<seg id="116">The people, that the asbestos in these buildings were stopped, fall ill now. </seg>
<seg id="117">And so Mesotheliom hits now younger people who did not work in the typical professions. </seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous tubes with asbestos isolations in hospitals lay under the earth, therefore patients were rather not stopped presumably the material </seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, that changed into pedestrian tunneling from a building into the other one (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as it often did to Graham Abbott), came with greatest probability into contact with the poisonous substances. </seg>
<seg id="120">It it proves that over several decades after the war hospitals for the patients possibly life-saving were, however, life-alarmingly for the handling doctors. </seg>
<seg id="121">It is removed also today still. </seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats. </seg>
<seg id="123">And it only hospital does not affect. </seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was used due to his fabulous isolating and flammhemmenden properties frequently in offices, businesses libraries and municipal halls. </seg>
<seg id="125">Also schools. </seg>
<seg id="126">In fact many people had presumably the first asbestos contact in the classroom. </seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils geared their bunsen burners to asbestos mats. </seg>
<seg id="128">The topic asbestos is spoken about web pages now frequently in schools. </seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile so innocent objects in our houses as slabs or scale roofs contained asbestos as a default. </seg>
<seg id="130">"It is an industry poison that in big parts of our real properties contained is", notices Andrew Morgan, the lawyer that Andrew Lawson represented Hospital in his process against Guy's. </seg>
<seg id="131">In a case the only contact which an affected woman remembered was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970ern. </seg>
<seg id="132">Therefore you look out as you tear down your garden shed. </seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge, that the illness is incurable, is immense. </seg>
<seg id="134">A while regrets to process that", Graham Abbott says. </seg>
<seg id="135">I went again to the work and attempted to make wider, however I noticed that I could not concentrate on what I did. </seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in the practice. </seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and take care of myself myself. </seg>
<seg id="138">Na yes, I will not experience any further Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the perspective change of the position of a doctor to that of a patient. </seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients in front of it he remembers how overwhelmed it was from all the information with which he rakes had to come. </seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very heavy to record that all", he says. </seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked to my doctor "how long has I still"? </seg>
<seg id="143">And one gave me still about 12 months. </seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, that I thought, "Na yes, I will not experience any further Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="145">That was it then." </seg>
<seg id="146">Mesotheliom is especially insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - the buckling itself - that the fatal cancer causes. </seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbestos contact. </seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of smallest fibres. </seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is swirled up and the fibres are inhaled, can they in the pleura, the skin around the lungs around, set. </seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can activate cell mutations. </seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with the inhaled acerose asbestos fibers", so professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor that changed Hospital in 2001 onto the Guy's. </seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital, presumed by the Andrew Lawson, that it has stopped it the asbestos, is now ironischerweise, a leading center during the treatment of Mesotheliom. </seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew lawsone and handled some others, that presumably also during their training in the hospital the asbestos were stopped. </seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles reach the pulmonary fabric Treasure says "where the skin is, if they are pressed from the breath process onto the edge. </seg>
<seg id="155">By nature it is from the beginning invasive. </seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options with the case of other cancer illnesses do not function at Mesotheliom so well. </seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation is for example hotly controversial. </seg>
<seg id="158">Some mean, that they is an attempt worth. </seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies that. </seg>
<seg id="160">"One cannot cut out the pleura", he says. </seg>
<seg id="161">You do not avoid that with the knife </seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy very well the "effect shows", however, "not cures. </seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long-term survivors, says Treasure. </seg>
<seg id="164">However, at the end they all die. </seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately some patients long live in fact, much longer than expects. </seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years according to the diagnosis. </seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years according to his own diagnosis Graham Abbott still fights. </seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultation office four years according to his diagnosis for coaffected ones. </seg>
<seg id="169">He imagined "Hallo, cancer headquarters," cheerfully in the case of calls. </seg>
<seg id="170">"It was very positive", says Abbott. </seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis 4 years before and was still very much active </seg>
<seg id="172">Initially Abbott had been offered to six chemotherapy cycles which would last four months and probably prolong his life only around a month. </seg>
<seg id="173">"I had despaired", he says. </seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up. </seg>
<seg id="175">Lawsone managed "to make "appear" it, however, "the things in an a little more positive light." </seg>
<seg id="176">After the consultation of several doctors Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, decided on continuing heart-thorax-specialist at the Guy's. </seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage through my not having to be referred, I simply called and I got an appointment admits Graham. </seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and to have to wait for the permission of the treatment </seg>
<seg id="179">Money is decisive for Mesotheliom-ills in order to be able to perceive the best available therapies. </seg>
<seg id="180">But if finally these treatments fail unavoidably, many concerned persons of another financial worry stand - over the future of the families that leave it behind. </seg>
<seg id="181">And so they are directed to the courts in the hope for compensation. </seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP. </seg>
<seg id="183">"It is since 1898 known that asbestos is extreme dangerously for the health", says Morgan. </seg>
<seg id="184">But what is changed, that one recognized that also a very small load represented a health risk. </seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the enterprises began to play a role. </seg>
<seg id="186">Finally Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital settled their case, but it was not what Morgan mentions a "genuine compensation" since lawsone could not prove with absolute security that his Mesotheliom was to be put down to an asbestos contact at the Guy's. </seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation for his death a speaker of the Guy's confirmed, however, that "the asbestos fibers in the affected cellar field in the 1990ern were removed." </seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson. </seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be removed </seg>
<seg id="190">It is actual for Mesotheliom ills that make an effort for compensation, an enormous problem to assign the fatal asbestos contact to a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents. </seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers are sold or closed. </seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can disappear. </seg>
<seg id="193">And definitely those ones that defend themselves against claims do not know that the time is for them, however, with the complainants </seg>
<seg id="194">As reaction to that there were this year clear new legislations that it makes more simply for Mesotheliom concerned persons to demand a compensation even if their former employers are not to be discovered anymore. </seg>
<seg id="195">The law established a fund of 350 million £ for all that were diagnosed after July 2012 supported by the insurance industry be able to prove a contact, but not be able to sue anybody. </seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases the complainants receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded to them in a normal compensation process - about 120,000 £. </seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful requests with the case of the program are expected per annum. </seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks as so many Mesotheliom concerned persons, that 350 million £ represented one "very good work of the insurance branch. </seg>
<seg id="199">"That is a deal of insurers for insurers", he says, and points out that it is a question of a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay with the case of this sum if the time had not passed over that and Mesotheliom ills find the enterprises and they could sue normal. </seg>
<seg id="200">Also Mike Penning, former work and retirement minister, admitted that the law is not "perfect". </seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admitted that faced with seven deaths a fast action is necessary daily. </seg>
<seg id="202">"The people suffer so very much and need help today", said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom-law in December of the last year. </seg>
<seg id="203">To this time Graham Abbott was for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski. </seg>
<seg id="204">After their first consultations Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation which he expects a positive effect of unlike Tom Treasure. </seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied from a radiotherapy and a chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate more than five years of up to 40 percent. </seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt fortified </seg>
<seg id="207">"That is natural with the most important thing, Abbott says. </seg>
<seg id="208">One sees that again and again with patients. </seg>
<seg id="209">There is over there something which makes you continue. </seg>
<seg id="210">If you give up, you are feeling very quickly more bad. </seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott subjected himself to the operation in March 2012. </seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August he had the last one of the six chemotherapy cycles behind themselves. </seg>
<seg id="213">Nachsorgescans did not show any sign of the illness. </seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had in March 2014 a Scan. </seg>
<seg id="215">There were several cancer-spots around my breast. </seg>
<seg id="216">I became 50. </seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-alarming. </seg>
<seg id="218">That is life-ending. </seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott subjected himself to six chemotherapy cycles. </seg>
<seg id="220">Now no track of the tumors is more visible. </seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is very hard physically and psychologically. </seg>
<seg id="222">You must think of practical things - above the money, if I am not more, for example, or to my wife show, as the storage water heater timing functioned. </seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you become negative. </seg>
<seg id="224">You must look forward. </seg>
<seg id="225">As father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy. </seg>
<seg id="226">"For parents that is heavy", he says. </seg>
<seg id="227">It is heavy to know, what one is supposed to say and how much. </seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I would have an illness with which I would not get old. </seg>
<seg id="229">You reacted very differently. </seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous. </seg>
<seg id="231">She told it to their friends and we got soon many calls. </seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved. </seg>
<seg id="233">She did not say much. </seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something, that all cancer patients must go through. </seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such conversations are not from hope pulled through, not of a track of hope for survival. </seg>
<seg id="236">The illness brings (so as end also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security </seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses right to government choice Hong Kong, demonstrators swear retaliation </seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday the Chinese parliament decided in spite of the increasing calls after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the choices in 2017 through the electorate from Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="3">This procedure inspires presumably the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district while activists were leading the planning and mobilization for this purpose within less hours according to the announcement into the ways. </seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese nation congress to reject all candidates not Peking-loyal allows it to the communist leaders fundamentally. </seg>
<seg id="5">"That does not come unexpectedly, but nevertheless it makes us furious", said right expert Emily Lau, chairperson of the Democratic Party. </seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Peking had promised. </seg>
<seg id="7">One lay to the inhabitants from Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime. </seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of the Chinese decision Li Fei, vicesecretary-general of the Constant Committee of the National Nation Congress, said that the admission of public nominations would be too "chaotic" at the choices for the government from Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Great Britain returned the control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Peking promised to make the inhabitants from 2017 choose the government chairmanship. </seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision of the Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision makes also clearly that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly through a nomination committee closely controlled by Peking in the hand. </seg>
<seg id="12">According to a new stipulation only candidates "with love of the country and love of Hong Kong" are in addition supposed to be admitted. </seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the greatest and most public-effective protests were occurring in Hong Kong for many years. </seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the prodemocratic campaign in Hong Kong the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace stands that organizers threatened with cutting off the finance district if Peking does not approve any real general right to vote </seg>
<seg id="15">At the Sunday evening hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters had met within few hours according to the announcement in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration the organizers said that their movement reached a new stage of civilian disobedience and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks. </seg>
<seg id="17">You did not give any nearer information to apparently avoiding around problems with the authorities, however. </seg>
<seg id="18">In an online communication the organizers informed, that the movement "the occupation of the central district only when last means took into account, an action that only then is supposed to occur if all dialog chances are exploited and no other choice withstands. </seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry about having to say that all dialog chances were exploited today and the occupation of the central district will occur definitively. </seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing themselves for the announcement of Peking for days, and intensified security measures measures were valid on Sunday before the government building including police forces and barricades. </seg>
<seg id="21">The riots are supported by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they lose the control of their city slowly. </seg>
<seg id="22">The Zuzug of people of the mainland intensifies the competition around products and services. </seg>
<seg id="23">In addition the fear increases, that the Worth Hong Kong's as democracy and freedom of speech under the wachsenden pressure of Peking begin to crumble. </seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central-movement since it endangers the business concern - the lifeline of Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests which they speak of could cause great economical damage, depending on whether, how many are participated in that and how long they last", right expert Regine Ip said that criticizes the movement for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stir up any apprehensions, that Hong Kong gets out of control. </seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad at investments. </seg>
<seg id="28">The from a government viewpoint controlled media of China reported also recently about the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled from western powers. </seg>
<seg id="29">In this summer activists organized an unofficial referendum for the choice rights which 780,000 people participated in - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong. </seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands participated in one of the greatest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region </seg>

<seg id="3">The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hands high, not fire" while they were waiting before the funeral. </seg>
<seg id="4">After two week long protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists. </seg>
<seg id="5">After their experience white feminist commentators put the sex before the race if it is a question of speaking to reproduction right and income inequalities </seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions were going up in the Middle west, however, and receiving country observation as a whole, Perez saw that the answers were about the race from white women to 100%. </seg>
<seg id="7">In comparison with the answers of black women shortly to the shots of the 9th August the personal essays with titles as "Thoughts" came "of a white woman" to Ferguson" and "Feminism does not turn only around the suppression from women" relatively late. </seg>

<seg id="9">"I do not believe that one finds many people in the feminism that be about the white and speak privileges in so highly class way she said. </seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt for this purpose pressed into squeezing out something for the incidents. </seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic for the crisis, in which we are and because the situation is so ethnisiert in Ferguson that they must squeeze that out. </seg>

<seg id="13">"I can publish something merry on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes here from everywhere", said Mitchell. </seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something over how colors stand in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening. </seg>
<seg id="15">"How it can be for women secure to talk about a relationship in public, however, not about security in the public room she asked. </seg>
<seg id="16">For black women as Mitchell who studied race, sex and sexuality in the history of the USA there is not any dichotomy between race and sex problems. </seg>
<seg id="17">For them black women did not have the luxury, to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality. </seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are combining the topics now race and sex in the feminist main stream circles Angela Hattery, professor for women and sex research at the George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite. </seg>
<seg id="19">"In between 1865 and 1890 at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman", said Hattery. </seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be participated in the history in order to justify the lynching-murder. </seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery the split came between white and black women at the point at which white fighters analyzed the country for the woman right to vote as Susan B. Anthony in the late years of the 19th century and stated that the fight could be successful for the right to vote only for in each case a group: Women or blacks. </seg>
<seg id="22">"You made the decision to support the woman right to vote and the right to vote for blacks should come later", said Hattery. </seg>
<seg id="23">If one remembers such things, it becomes conscious to one with power why colored women do not trust white women. </seg>
<seg id="24">We did not make our job good. </seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women with protecting their husbands and sons. </seg>
<seg id="26">Also after women received the right to vote in 1920, it lasted another decade until white women organized themselves against the lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching. </seg>
<seg id="27">The group arose almost 40 years according to the initial request around help on the part of black women, says Mitchell. </seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, race discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "call tracing call holds" played with the problems with which black women sat down from each other since generations. </seg>
<seg id="29">"It would not be fabulous, when the activists, the feminist platforms traditional over such decree the right to education of a child so seriously would take as they put that with the right onto conception control""? Mitchell asked. </seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation that based their career on the fight for reproduction rights and the access to contraceptive means attempt to understand now what means that. </seg>
<seg id="31">The known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting from Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pointed article of Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the guerrilla warfare in which it demands more protests from white Americans on the topic racism. </seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope for women who have an other, but parallel reason for understanding a danger being inherent in the body - and opinion on the race which are clearly different in public inquiries - mentioning the changes", wrote Steinem. </seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for a rather intersektionalen feminism, in which Rassen- in the same way as sex topics are spoken to, some of their comments on the race topic are nevertheless amazed in America. </seg>
<seg id="34">Christina summer, researcher at the American one of Enterprise of institutes and authoress of "Who Stole Feminism?" said opposite She The People, that young men in the United States, in particular young colored men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters, however," Steinems remarks on Ferguson conflict too their former criticism </seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of specific programs for girls and young women, however almost nothing for boys. </seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's Keeper, put on in order to help vulnerable young black and hispanischen men there were annoyed reactions of many feminists, under that Gloria Steinem. </seg>
<seg id="37">The relation of the police to the the black Community is not the only problem, that into the foreground of the main stream feminism pushes. </seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied capella minors at the southwest border of the country this year, also the topic of the immigration reform goes again onto the surface - this time as a woman topic. </seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chairperson of We Belong Together, of an organization which mobilizes women for the immigration reform said that for a new consideration of the topic as an essential woman topic she must publish only the histories of the immigrant women. </seg>
<seg id="40">"These speak for themselves," Mercado said. </seg>
<seg id="41">If the great majority of the work visas goes onto masculine immigrants, the women who accompany it are in a position in which they are sensitive to domestic power and exploitation. </seg>
<seg id="42">"Find these histories a reverberation in the woman organizations", she said. </seg>

<seg id="4">There was a colored round of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland. </seg>
<seg id="5">The martial fighter troop of the gladiator school of "Amor Mortis", who used every rain pause for demonstrating their robust combat art in the arena preserved with soft sand, was main attraction of the day beyond doubt </seg>
<seg id="6">Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be humorous and competent presenter and sent his men after each other to the ring for the heroic duel in different gladiator types. </seg>
<seg id="7">First it was up to the "Provocatoren" with rectangular shield and Kurzschwert as well as football pad at the left leg and splint at the right arm. </seg>
<seg id="8">The "Essedarii" with breast-plate, short sword and throw lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection, followed. </seg>
<seg id="9">The appearance of the "Retiarius" who competed with the "Secutor" with casting net, trident and dagger and pushed the lad to ground after short fight was especially impressive. </seg>
<seg id="10">There the swords cracked metallically at each other, the shields schepperten and the throw lances flew humming through the arena, that one fear and bangs could become around the health of the gladiators. </seg>
<seg id="11">However onto those ones the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee an always attentive eye, had. </seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to make the roman everyday life revive again and make the culture of the Roman time erlebbar", explained the intention to Lorenz Euskirchen, chairperson of the organizer "Circle of friends Römerkanal", behind the racket. </seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation time an "Oppidum Romanum", a roman city, became from the recreational park for a day as Vizebürgermeister Claus Wehage found in his greeting word. </seg>
<seg id="14">Finally the Romans did not bring only war and conquest in our region but also the roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today. </seg>
<seg id="15">Remains of that were to be marveled at also at the Roman day, about instance "aqueduct marble" of the Roman channel bridge eleven meters high and 1400 meters long that some day stood at Lüftelberg. </seg>
<seg id="16">The Frontinus-society compared the water and energy supply once and now, and manageress Petra Fricke knew: "We profit today still from the knowledge from then". </seg>
<seg id="17">That confirms also diploma surveyor Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rhine creek the measurement instruments' of the Romans as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra imagined. </seg>
<seg id="18">The Roman villa into rough drafts presented to Blankenheim and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the Original-Hypokauste, the hot air heating which once warmed up the Roman villa. </seg>

<seg id="23">She introduced a series of find pieces from these excavations in a glass showcase cabinet, under that a big plate, several fine glass envelopes as well as parts of a dainty necklace. </seg>
<seg id="24">The villa existed presumably from the first up to the fourth century according to Christ, up to the idea of the Germans in the then roman Rhineland, Morscheiser presumes. </seg>
<seg id="25">With it the children occupied themselves furthermore with the roman windmill game, similar to the present nine men's morris, or they wrote their names with metal styluses as once the roman pupils on guard boards </seg>
<seg id="26">At the state of the Roman thermal springs Zülpich the children mosaics themselves were allowed to put, make glass mosaics at the state of the glass museum Rhine creek and help themselves Nettersheim at the state of the Eifel natural center a heavy wheat mill of stone in order to mill the flour for a pancake bread or a muesli </seg>
<seg id="27">With the faithfully reproduced roman touring car pulled by two cold-blooded animals the visitors went through the recreational park and got in this case also past the impressive state of the Urban grammar school that "presented" the results of their "Roman project weeks" here. </seg>
<seg id="28">With a Roman week of the 13th to 21st September also the municipality guard mountain into that brings in Rhineland-wide called out Roman year 2014, that is supposed to remind Augustus of the death of emperor 2000 years ago. </seg>

<seg id="1">Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington room increases with the economical recovery </seg>
<seg id="2">A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs. </seg>
<seg id="3">It means also higher taxes. </seg>
<seg id="4">State and local notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies for enterprises in the country went up in the last year easily while the economical recovery was speeding up, such an again published study in the last week, and the companies in the Washington room did not form any exception. </seg>
<seg id="5">Enterprises in the room District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27.6 billion $ to state and local places in the finance year 2013, a rise, around 3.8 percent opposite the gains of 2012 at the level of 26.6 billion $. </seg>
<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of the enterprises went up in the last year about 4.3 percent onto 671 billion $, in comparison with 3.9 percent per year before, and it was the third growth year in consequence after the several years of sinking answers 2009 and 2010. </seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes went up more strongly than the local deliveries about 4.3 percent, so the study, that of the service agency seriousness & Young with the center for State Taxation was carried on, a fiscal policy group. </seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax yields of the District, 56 percent, comes from enterprise taxes while 36 percent of the gains Marylands are coming from enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia achieves the least tax yields with 28 percent from enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="10">A majority of the rise with the case of the tax yields is reasonable in a recovery of the real property values of the enterprises, say the researchers, which led to a rise of the real property taxes around 3.7 percent this year after the three successive years with growth rates from less than 1 percent. </seg>
<seg id="11">While a big part of these profits was coming from big states as California, New York and Texas, the course seems to apply also to the Washington room </seg>
<seg id="12">Enterprises in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid together more than 10 billion $ at state and local real property taxes in the last year, in comparison with 9.6 billion $ 2012 - a rise during a year around 4.2 percent. </seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery with the case of the real property values is not so effective in Maryland during the rise of state and local tax yields since the real property taxes amount to just more than one fifth of the notices of assessment assessment notices bills demands levies of enterprises here. </seg>
<seg id="14">Enterprise in Virginia and D.C. almost half of their state and local taxes pay in the form of real property taxes. </seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland following happens: a big part of the real properties, in particular in the tax field around D.C., is either in the possession of the government or of non-profit-organizations that" do not "pay" any real property taxes, said Douglas to Lindholm, manager of the center on State Taxation. </seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely on the income taxes for example much more in order to be able to offer the same services which other states offer. </seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery with the case of the tax yields through enterprises cannot be assigned only to the recovery of the property market </seg>
<seg id="18">Seem also to recover to enterprise gains, so the data. </seg>
<seg id="19">Enterprises in the region reported about income taxes with the case of state organizations of 2.3 billion $ in comparison with 2.1 billion in the year 2012. </seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took 1 billion $ in enterprise income taxes, the highest amount of the region </seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend is going into the same direction, the local tax burden does not go up for enterprises at all three places evenly </seg>
<seg id="22">The rise rate in the District corresponded to the national average with 4.3 percent while the rise was being clearly higher in Maryland, 4.9 percent. </seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia announced a lower-average tax amount of 4.1 percent. </seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the clearly least enterprise income taxes (in all three there are fixed enterprise tax rates) with 6 percent in all three areas of competence. </seg>
<seg id="25">The enterprise tax rate in Maryland is enclosed at 8.25 percent and in the District relatively high 9.975 percent. </seg>
<seg id="26">A comparable study of the US chamber of commerce at the beginning of this year showed, that in Virginia smaller state and local enterprise taxes are demanded and there is in total a better tax climate than in Maryland. </seg>
<seg id="27">In the study the District was not examined. </seg>
<seg id="28">In spite of the advantages Virginia is under pressure through his southern neighbor. </seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina passed laws for the lowering of his enterprise tax rates this year of 6.9 percent on 6 percent, the same sentence as Virginia, and the sentence will sink in the coming year onto 5 percent. </seg>
<seg id="30">If the state keeps on reaching his income objectives in the coming year, this law could reduce the enterprise income tax sentence of the state to 2017 apart from 3 percent. </seg>
<seg id="31">Going in the meantime seems better to the small firms in the Washington room and they pay therefore more state and local taxes, so the recent study. </seg>
<seg id="32">Enterprise taxes that are paid as personal income taxes through small businessmen - a temporary structure according to which most small enterprises are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia went up in the last year about 20 percent on 2.4 billion $, a clear faster growth rate as the enterprise taxes in total. </seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the rise near the enterprise steering wheels as a whole will presumably stop country this year with a rise of the general increase dam tax yields for the state and the local governments about 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 in comparison with the same period of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless the Washington room could hinterherhinken if the edition shortening of the Federal Government affects the labor market in the region </seg>

<seg id="2">AMAZON confirmed just what information had told on Monday morning: The online-retailer - and video producer, and a great number of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US-$). </seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was presumed to a large extent that YouTube would gain the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it looked like this, as if the sale of Twitch were onto the video service of Google for one cool billion thing decided on, and the cooperation appeared also natural </seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch that only three years ago as Justin.tv was founded had started as general Streamingdienst - a live version of YouTube. </seg>
<seg id="6">Instead of this that it wanted to publish their acts of daring a platform quickly for players in games, a "YouTube for live games", such an insider. </seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch-interface. </seg>
<seg id="8">And give "let's play", a video genre, to the (mostly older) games in the smart aleck one painting of paint of hermetism theater, are on YouTube already very much popular. </seg>
<seg id="9">It is now like this that YouTube is often named if one wants to describe Twitch, therefore it became the information that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, something boredly picked up, a textbook example of an established technique enterprise that buys up a potential competitor. </seg>
<seg id="10">It is a puzzle why deal with YouTube was not achieved to that one since the enterprise was ready to pay so much as Amazon according to reports. </seg>
<seg id="11">All that we know at the moment about that is this statement of Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We decided for Amazon because they believe in our Community they split up our values and long-term visions and they want to help us with reaching there more quickly." </seg>
<seg id="12">A further secret is, honestly said, the incredible success of Twitch. </seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs as me that declare that they do sport more gladly than to watch during that, is to watch it to others during the playing heavily to understand the attraction that comes from that instead of taking even the control console into the hand. </seg>
<seg id="14">It is a thing to look to a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning over the shoulder while she is creeping through resident Evil and something very else, to watch to a silkworm moth during how it is fired into the head 20 times after each other in call of Duty. </seg>
<seg id="15">All these games could now just look at you. </seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem lies in many of the most popular games being ego-games today, therefore the watching without own control of the look perspective can be a correctly good prescription for headaches. </seg>
<seg id="17">I add, that the quickness flows into which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete whole games in record time, entertaining are. </seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as a game or humor virtuoso is not in this case, his Twitch-channel is not presumably so very much interesting. </seg>
<seg id="19">But what sceptics know as I already of that? </seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called of 55 million different visitors monthly and the fourth-biggest source of internet traffic peaks is. </seg>
<seg id="21">And as exactly Amazon wants to make money from that? </seg>
<seg id="22">It is heavy to introduce oneself that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could simply have swallowed. </seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something which would have every enterprise gladly: Thousands of young men who are umworben as advertising-customers. </seg>
<seg id="24">How the chairperson of Twitch, Shear, did not say yet Amazon and Twitch "believe both at the future of the Gaming"," and the medium does not show any signs of a shrinkage once - swallow - as spectator sport. </seg>

<seg id="4">Temporarily the admission had to be stopped. </seg>
<seg id="5">"That was annoyed", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers. </seg>
<seg id="6">Salt whisk l light and fun. </seg>
<seg id="7">Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula from two Spanish words. </seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is supposed to radiate brightness through various shows on day and at the evening. </seg>
<seg id="9">Na, and the fun comes in any case of alone. </seg>
<seg id="10">That was proved already on the early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air prepared themselves. </seg>
<seg id="11">The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations. </seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded in that. </seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply states on the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearer and wider surroundings had made themselves cosy </seg>
<seg id="14">You followed the first live appearances, bobbed with the foot in time, enjoyed cool drinks - shortly: Relaxation pure and was pleasure announced. </seg>
<seg id="15">And that right through the generations. </seg>
<seg id="16">While ones were lolling about onto covers on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar, other at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek refreshed, the junior staff raged on the hopping-castle that was a big attraction of attraction for the smaller guests. </seg>
<seg id="17">But also at the the voluntary helpers had to do all hands to child makeups fully in the truest sense of the word in order to become gentleman to the crush and to conjure imaginative creations into the small faces. </seg>
<seg id="18">The larger ones used the football player tables or participated in a skateboard-workshop which the Goodfoot-crew adjusted from Salzwedel. </seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came. </seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17.30 o'clock it beat down onto the visitors, particularly families searched the Wide and Dry one. </seg>
<seg id="21">This did not do any breaking off to nevertheless the attractivity of the celebration. </seg>
<seg id="22">"More people came than expected," would say Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line". </seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore nothing is opposed to a repetition of the great party in the coming year. </seg>
<seg id="24">Although at contents and size of the events must be worked still, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday opposite the nation voice </seg>
<seg id="25">He designated as annoyed, that meanwhile the admission had to be stopped. </seg>
<seg id="26">The security company was obvious with for few strengths booked. </seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Some that already had paid did not come anymore to the ground. </seg>
<seg id="28">The resonance was very good. </seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who romped in the castle garden. </seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the case of the audio engineering. </seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-band Blocks'n'Rox aborted their appearance therefore in an enervated way. </seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not in the situation to create a to some extent reasonable Sound. </seg>
<seg id="33">The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built up because the tents could not be brought to salt whisk because of a puncture. </seg>
<seg id="34">"In the next year they" will "be", however, in this case", according to the organizer. </seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere night of the Amula-Open-Airs was from the numbers of visitors more than succeeded. </seg>
<seg id="36">And that with the case of bad weather. </seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers committed some errors which are still forgiven with the case of the first time, but were eliminated have had them with the case of the second edition. </seg>
<seg id="38">Also in the social network Facebook the organizers must take criticism </seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, however for twelve euros one simply "expected" more", Melanie Meier is expressed on the event page </seg>
<seg id="40">"You overstrained yourselves unfortunately a little", thinks Ele Zimmermann at same place. </seg>
<seg id="41">Others do not see the initial problems very so narrow. </seg>
<seg id="42">I find it very good, that not natter some only stupidly, but attempt also really to put something on the legs. </seg>
<seg id="43">Guard off"! Stephanie Jenß to the Amula writes. </seg>
<seg id="44">Now the organizers have a year of time in order to stop these criticism points. </seg>

<seg id="1">Do the castle associations pull soon at a rope again? </seg>
<seg id="2">Last there was again and again quarrel between the two Wolfratshauser castle associations. </seg>
<seg id="3">Now the executive boards think about a possible cooperation. </seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser castle the late Richard Dimbath, former chairperson of the Wolfratshauser castle friends, mentioned the project in the French Guédelon. </seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago yet no good climate existed between the castle association and the castle friends wolf council beluga. </seg>
<seg id="6">The points of view seemed distinctly different up to now as the history of the Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction are supposed to be dealt with. </seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two warehouses on each other move too: Conversations are supposed to be led already soon about a common procedure. </seg>
<seg id="8">The association executive boards confirm to Torsten Sjöberg (Castle association) and to Herbert Piffl (Castle friends) on demand of our newspaper that. </seg>
<seg id="9">"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could get together once", tells Sjöberg. </seg>
<seg id="10">According to his opinion all members of both associations could pull in the future again at a rope. </seg>
<seg id="11">So more quickly visible successes are to be noted. </seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle friends were having a reconstruction of the castle around the suddenly late Richard Dimbath till the end at the mountain wood in mind, stands for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the ground at most front place. </seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, Second chairperson of the castle friends, was very pleased with the call according to own information </seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death he presides over the castle friends. </seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairperson is supposed to be found in the middle of September in a general meeting. </seg>
<seg id="16">Currently the association counts according to the 74-year long one about 40 members. </seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we made the association activities out of respect rest first of all". This "thinking-phase" was necessary in order to "consider how it could go on". </seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl the new chairperson is supposed to go then into the conversation with the castle association. </seg>
<seg id="19">Until then the castle friends could make themselves also a current atmosphere picture within their grouping. </seg>
<seg id="20">There is currently yet not a candidate for the chairmanship, says Piffl. </seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident, that somebody will find himself He himself does not want to present himself because he has his residence in bath Tölz. </seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairperson should be a Wolfratshauser. </seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer keeps on wanting "to cooperate" in the project "however very gladly. </seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view as regards reconstruction will presumably consist in the eyes Piffls in next time stay. </seg>
<seg id="25">He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle. </seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream. </seg>
<seg id="27">Through a high participation of the population as well as through voluntary helpers from all world it is a tourist magnet. </seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "Also I was at the beginning sceptical. </seg>
<seg id="29">However, with time I was convinced more and more that it is reasonable to drive forward the project". An "alone position feature" can be created for the raftsman city. </seg>
<seg id="30">Here there is not really otherwise anything. </seg>
<seg id="31">Furthermore the project would be financeable through EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes. </seg>
<seg id="32">"I personally do not want to fling the idea of the reconstruction simply overboard therefore". He hopes for the castle association moving in this point maybe a little. </seg>
<seg id="33">Their aim of documenting the history first of all "is important and good". </seg>
<seg id="34">After that one could see. </seg>

<seg id="2">Since the costs are for uni-textbooks for many students more than 1,000 $ per annum, the Fast-Zweitsemesterstudent considered check mate Schroeder a clever saving-idea. </seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a lending-system for books of students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation in order to delay the moving-sale. </seg>
<seg id="4">"My mathematics book usually costs 180 $, but I got it for 10 $ for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-cookie", said Schroeder, 19, who goes to the Covenant College in Georgia. </seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester would have cost it 430 $, he said. </seg>
<seg id="6">He spent 120 $. </seg>
<seg id="7">The college management informed, that students distribute on average more than 1,200 $ annual for textbooks and study material, that there would be different curbing cost expansion options for the students, however. </seg>
<seg id="8">Online-shops and creative Herangehensweisen as the Schroeders are the solution of the choice for the students increasingly. </seg>
<seg id="9">The renting of textbooks is liked, and so students can use a book for a semester, frequently too a clearly more favorable price than during the purchase. </seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, who practices more than 250 university book stores, informed that the renting of librettos has doubled since 2011. </seg>
<seg id="11">Vice-president Tevor Meyer said to Neebos to show inquiries in the branch that about instance a quarter of the books was rented in the college book stores in the last spring semester. </seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks stores curtains are bought according to statement for the National Association of College commercial union in campus book stores. </seg>
<seg id="13">Here the multiplication table is for the best deals. </seg>
<seg id="14">Buy Online </seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books cost in an online way only a third of the price, for which to have it in the campus book store are. </seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost 290 $, can be gotten, however, with the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for 239.99 $. </seg>
<seg id="17">Needed buy </seg>
<seg id="18">When one the memos of others or normal use tracks nothing form, needed books are a good option. </seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is needed on Chegg.com for 93.49 $ have. </seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, end student at the Brigham Young University, it says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a needed edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business." </seg>
<seg id="21">The book was sold again for 48 $. </seg>
<seg id="22">Academic as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at the Amherst College Without Walls recommended students to ask their professors whether former editions are permissible. </seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers. </seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases older editions can be acquired often for one fraction of the costs for the newest edition </seg>
<seg id="25">Except for Chegg and Amazon also Half.com of eBay Inc is a popular alternative for needed books. </seg>
<seg id="26">Rents </seg>
<seg id="27">The renting of textbooks is a consideration worth, if you handle it quite well, think of that, to return it and not kept you the books on completion of the course would like. </seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the costs of an again bought book. </seg>
<seg id="29">A student could rent for example "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about 20 $. </seg>
<seg id="30">You inform yourself of the regulations of the business at that you rent, also about the punishment fees that accumulate where appropriate for the writing of memos, underlinings or use tracks </seg>
<seg id="31">Tenant looked out: If you do not return the book, the punishment fees can even exceed the price of a new book. </seg>
<seg id="32">E-books </seg>
<seg id="33">Also e-books instead of traditional textbooks are an option. </seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes these books de facto are rented, when an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers as Amazon.com, Chegg as well as Barnes & Noble Inc. is provided. </seg>
<seg id="35">At Chegg one can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about 61 $. </seg>
<seg id="36">Bracey says that students find the best offers frequently in literature courses since many classics can be downloaded nowadays freely while scientific and engineer-scientific textbooks are can be very expensive. </seg>
<seg id="37">Umschauen in any case. </seg>
<seg id="38">The ISBN-number recommends for the pricing at books Joe Gault, 29, who soon will go to the Pepperdine Law School, since one can be so secure to find the correct textbook. </seg>
<seg id="39">And before an online-order one should check, according to Gault, whether in fact the book is in stock. </seg>

<seg id="9">He will have the first championship hit in the rapid-dress therefore in specific memory </seg>
<seg id="10">"For me that is something very special, I am from the rapid junior staff", Schrammel said. </seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short-term basin of Mario Pavelic Schrammel moved from the left one onto the right defensive page and his thing made up also there very much. </seg>
<seg id="12">He mirror-turned enough experience, that it can carry out this position also. </seg>
<seg id="13">He earned the gate", he achieved "heuer" already some Assists", Barisic praised. </seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character Schrammel also the flank delivered to the 2:0 through court man after well an hour, that brought finally the decision. </seg>
<seg id="15">Because before that also the guests could absolutely have chalked up. </seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we had some luck today", noticed also Schrammel that alluded in this way to the Auseinanderklaffen of achievement and result in the last weeks: "The results were not right, but the playful thing was always good in comparison with the last year". </seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic even found that one was "before better in many games than today" - against "the strongest team to play in this season in this stadium". </seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since 26 July proved therefore, that the team structure is the setbacks zum Trotz intact: "Today my team showed that she has character". </seg>
<seg id="19">For it not less pleasant: "That we played again at last to zero". </seg>
<seg id="20">A lot work during international match pause Auch the circumstance, that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failure rates are to be lamented, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl as well as Philipp Schobesberger gave their Startelfdebüts, makes the victory even more valuable. </seg>
<seg id="21">"One must not forget that", Barisic admonished that lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic Spieler "that were very stable in last time". </seg>
<seg id="22">The international match pause must be used therefore, around "Wounds to leak and to hot up the pace a little in the physical field declared Barisic that has five U21 selection protagonists in his rows </seg>
<seg id="23">One to whom the pause presumably comes especially sitedly is captain Hofmann. </seg>
<seg id="24">It tears itself for the team, passes about pains. </seg>
<seg id="25">Just in this difficult phase it showed that he is a very important player for us", stated Barisic. </seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann did not give only the structure to the game of Rapids before his exchanging in the 68th minute, but it achieved also the second gate. </seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year long one that completed his 350th Federal League game it was the first hit out of the game since 2nd November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira). </seg>
<seg id="28">Court man: "Must not" believe, that everything is good now We had luck secure also a little, but sometime the luck also to us must come back. </seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was highest time", said Hofmann. </seg>
<seg id="30">It admonished certainly too concentrated operations: "One must not see that always black and white. </seg>
<seg id="31">We did not play in the last weeks as bad as that was represented. </seg>
<seg id="32">We must not believe, however, either that everything is good now. </seg>
<seg id="33">He could not deny the importance of his role for the team. </seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless it is a very young team which I can help at the moment very much. </seg>
<seg id="35">Nevertheless those ones stop themselves in certain phases at me" Hofmann said. </seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig-coach Michael Baur had to reproach itself and his team for little. </seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the fast Gegentreffer "from the category charm gate", as well as the regular gate of user in the 40th minute that had been deprived of by referee Kollegger incorrectly. </seg>
<seg id="38">The single reproach, that I am been able to do the team, that we were direction gate in some phases not concrete enough. </seg>
<seg id="39">There too few had ends we. </seg>
<seg id="40">It resembled inside defender Maximilian Karner: "It began now badly, then we found, however, in that and made even a gate. </seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands the photo from Kiev from "Staatlichkeitsgesprächen" with east Ukraine </seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian president Wladimir Putin demanded according to Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stops the fights against the separatists in the east of the country and incorporates them immediately with negotiations for the "Staatlichkeit" of the disloyal region </seg>
<seg id="3">His speaker Dimitri Peskow explained later that Putin did not think in this way that the field of east Ukraine standing under the control of the separatists becomes a part of Russia, but that his status must be defined opposite Ukraine again in order to give the power to the representation of his rights and interests to the Russian-speaking region </seg>
<seg id="4">Putins appeal to the Kiewer government to negotiations on eye level with the pro-Russian insurgents matches, however, the strategy since beginning of the outrages five months ago apparently hunted by him: Help for the separatists while taking from fields and pressure on the Ukrainian government, around the again proclaimed region Novorossija actual independence for an alliance with Russia instead of making possible with the west. </seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television broadcast station channel One Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the moving-conquest of the fields held by separatists in the eastern regions Donezk and Luhansk, that in March and were taken April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18th March. </seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists referred in last time to the taken field as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a concept that reminds of the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire. </seg>
<seg id="7">Putin referred, that all those ones, who in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the choices on 26th Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian municipalities in the fields held by separatists hope for quick peace conversations "in their illusions caught" are, told Itar-Tass. </seg>
<seg id="8">"We must record detailed conversations immediately, not only to technical questions, but also to the political organization of the society and the state status of south-east Ukraine in order to protect the interests of the people living there" he said. </seg>
<seg id="9">It said to Peskow that Putins reference to the Staatlichkeit in the context with the greater autonomy which is discussed by the Kiewer leadership for months must be seen in order to dispel apprehensions in Russian-speaking fields that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered. </seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern fields, said Peskow. </seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a question here of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said "because it is not a question of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but around an internal conflict in Ukraine." </seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to the correction of the "faulty interpretation" of Putins remarks underlined the claim to leadership of Russia with the case of the contact with the separatistic rebellion in the east unlike the direct Annektion of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians. </seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have annexed far greater difficulties the regions Donezk and Luhansk in east Ukraine there most of the 6.5 million inhabitants no Russians are and turned out inquiries from the time in front of the conflict a wide majority for the whereabouts in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy which was spoken to by Russian diplomats on international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine proxy to discuss own commercial agreements and exterior relationships, and give so the Kremlin de facto the control of a field which combines the Russian state field with the Crimea. </seg>
<seg id="15">The home port for the majority of the Russian navy as well as an important commercial port and historical coast region is the five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea. </seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is in addition rich of mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military. </seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested during his speech for the inauguration on 7th June that the Ukrainian legislation is supposed to consider - after new choices - additions to the constitution with which a greater control is empowered to the respective fields about their finances and the status of the languages. </seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy seems to support in sharp contrast those of the Kremlin and the separatistic rebels whose armament and Aufstachelung Moscow are reproached. </seg>
<seg id="19">Putins last request at Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on eye level followed after a further advance of the rebels in the last week after Russian troops and tanks about the before peaceful region along the Asowschen sea penetrated east Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists supported by Russia took control in the surprise attack which according to apprehensions of Ukrainian security guards the first step of a campaign for the takeover is to the strategic coast region up to the Crimea from Nowoasowsk. </seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason massive civilian and military preparations started, around Mariupol, to fortify a steel industry harbor with 500,000 inhabitants that lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea peninsula. </seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked urgently a former Soviet republic which is independent for 23 years for actions in order to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="23">"We to stand shortly before a point at which there is not any back anymore" warned Poroshenko. </seg>
<seg id="24">There are thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks now on the territory of Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id="25">The EU peak did not conclude any concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia which are supposed to come into force with the case of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis. </seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers penetrated the Donezkregion last week in order to support the besieged separatists, said colonel Andrij Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian of National Security and Defense Council reports on Saturday in Kiev. </seg>
