<seg id="1">Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Just as unions die, die, the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore I proudly together with the civil rights icon John Lewis staff the Enabling Act before.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities in cases of discrimination because of the organization of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and so will stop anti-union set forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">Supplementing the national labor law law to create an opportunity for discrimination exposed workers to organize a union representative to a civil court to sue for justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way is to understand what suggest Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill that would link back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks, which the unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - have Americans once countries around the world encouraged to recognize workers' rights to expand and to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, to the millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, press freedom and the right to organize in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied after World War II Japan, encouraged General Douglas MacArthur and his staff the country to adopt a constitution which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojo would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied after World War II Germany, urged General Dwight Eisenhower David and his staff the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism of Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize, and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly testified: "The right to form associations to the working and economic conditions secure and will improve each individual and each profession or trade guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or aim it is to reduce null and void; it targeted measures are unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights held, by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was designed, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948 added Roosevelt and the other author of a guarantee a that " everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them. "</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">As this country other countries to discuss how they could form civil and democratic societies, declared Americans, that the right to form a union - and that this union then could take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - to be protected must.</seg>
<seg id="19">Having these rights in America came under fire, it is actually very wise, to the American ideal to perform again in mind, according to which working people must have the right to unite and make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr., fifty years ago said:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now all know that the workers' movement, the strength of the nation is not restricted, but enlarged.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising living standards of millions of people working has created miraculously a market for industry and lifted the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves.</seg>
<seg id="25">The history remembers, and we should do well.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the enhancement of the protection of citizens' rights to protect against discrimination in the establishment of employee representation - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis to renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy cashed.</seg>

<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the judgment extended also to the doctors of the two hospitals that had the action not connected and also requested briefing rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, which courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for not constitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key points of a law in Texas that most of the remaining hospitals in the state have been forced to shut down, stopped by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion advocates and the American College of Gynecologists and Ostretricians and the American Medical Association agree in saying that briefing rights of doctors demand unnecessary restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortionists response to this is that the measures are designed to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has, over Patienteineinweiserechte, said the Center for Reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state to be forced to perform any more abortions, this doctor would no longer carry out of fear for his safety, the operation, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In their argument against the judgment said representatives of the State of Louisiana, that they would punish any doctors for performing abortions, while their applications were pending on patient referrers True.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in the year 1958th</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and from the series was on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">He visited "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was hard to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Listen to the noise on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let your sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass, or the beauty of a cricket stroke.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A large part of my life it was this serious guy in the corner who was reading the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the days of his father, he nevertheless won an insight into how life must have been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian labyrinth with flame shock and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father lay formerly simply into the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked around there, I realized that he had done for years, to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' expressions of love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when there towards the end of her life suffered by my mother, we began to "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love that he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you even with the "I love you" stop?</seg>
<seg id="26">Stop it but to embrace me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">with Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should not we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should not we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I very was very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I moved through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's career change is perhaps in its elegant, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he has been praised by critics for his Othello, he is paid to the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">This was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">That's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started only 16 years ago when he worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ spotted him on the stage, as he imitated people and wrote to New Faces of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to grow up not only before the public eye, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I was able to be an efficient jokes-narrative machine, while I was a star on television, and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show possessed a light entertainment program, in which the people "black anmalten", Henry led his comedy there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">In my family it was very uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="54">I wish somehow that it never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a weird, uncomfortable position for me, but I was working on big projects, and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But these "years of award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">The introduction of characters that the British black culture both mocked as celebrated, Henry worked in the eighties to an alternative comedy circuit.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first row of the Lenny Henry show went on the air in 1984, and in the nineties he has worked as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Head! known.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles marked his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought to himself: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like when you bring only the time rum or will walk a little on the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="60">Thereafter, a documentary series for Radio 4 was titled What's So Great About ...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode turned to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">In Shakespeare I was downright allergic.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never learned in school right about him and held him for a domain predominantly middle-class whites in tights and a cabbage in front it.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very afraid.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Do not make it bad if you do not know what you're talking.</seg>
<seg id="67">Take a couple of words in his mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry led to 20 lines from Othello's last speech on the documentary and he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what, it's a serious matter, take them seriously, learning your lines, researching a bit.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident and that just did not happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice told me," You have now bridged 10 minutes while they repair the computer. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would go on, once the problem had been solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for it.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, so stay in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">To learn the text for Fences was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">Also was well received, so it is like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destiny." "</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I stick to it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love that.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is permeated by humorous outbursts, while he imitates persons repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided not to make stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of instant gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you are looking for the all the time, you go with it before a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I step sometimes live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it does not give me as much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him if he will ever again make a stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun I had in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I do not think I want to give up ever again.</seg>
<seg id="99">Is this so its new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like being an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">One always tells a story, and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="2">44 years he was in the teaching profession, including 23 as a head teacher.</seg>
<seg id="3">From that time Manfred Richter knows many seasoned Peter Hausener and Kollbacher from their time as students.</seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his quest to see the students humans.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sněžka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive of his home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930 in Trutnov / North Bohemia, today Trutnov.</seg>
<seg id="8">Already with 14 he became interested in after four years of high school for the teaching profession.</seg>
<seg id="9">One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.</seg>
<seg id="11">After a few months in a camp it was in 1946 after Bayern - in the boxcar.</seg>
<seg id="12">So was staggered judge the Upper Franconian village sinks.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher training was held in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">These Manfred Richter had six ten kilometers walk to the next station a week, take the train to Bamberg, there walk three kilometers through the city to school and back in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, Manfred Richter was in a Red Cross home in Bamberg a sleeping: with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teacher trainees the second state examination.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since Upper Franconia for him had no vacant teaching position, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on November 1, 1954, the school in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Miss-room" was his first "official residence" in the schoolhouse.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958 he moved into the newly built house next to the school teacher a three-room service apartment.</seg>
<seg id="20">This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school had been dissolved in 1968 Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="21">Until then there were in Kollbach in Schulverband Petershausen-Kollbach three classes and in Petershausen five.</seg>
<seg id="22">From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">As the Schulverband Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in place.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, joined the then Rector Georg Sigl to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers could relate to today's construction, from September 1982, which was extended by Judge retirement in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the simple generosity of Mayor Ludwig Götz, who had also rely on community charges a workroom and a broader 1997 basements, although that was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Götz was very friendly school," says Richter remembered gratefully.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative who had responded to a presentation of a School Board on Law and Justice: "We must never forget the love." Manfred Richter sat around, what he had heard as a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"You have to give to the children two things: roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to learn: "This does not always succeed". Whether he as only his students or just his own six children said, is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, the judge was doing sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">When students started fighting, they received from him not as a detention and have not been sentenced to detention.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the community had two pairs of judges can purchase boxing gloves and let the two rivals compete against each other, even if the baby you should have a violet.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the benefit of the school used as a judge Rector a good relationship with the then Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">This moved the non-party judges after retirement to 1996 to stand at least the last on the CSU list for the local council.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Richter was selected in sixth place and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="27">DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.</seg>
<seg id="28">The opportunity for sweeping move in the open air was used frequently despite the sporting activities on the bike.</seg>

<seg id="2">She arrives with a proud fame train of the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own combat experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombardier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was seven years Chief Executive of the Financial Times and stepped back as the top item of the parent company Pearson went to a younger male counterparts.</seg>

<seg id="8">It was recommended by David Cameron, Lord Browne, the former head of BP, as this was looking for more private-sector expertise in Whitehall: it became a consultant of the Cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councilor.</seg>
<seg id="10">As early as May, I described the task of the Chairman of a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Trust works in two directions: inwards towards the first guard of the own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and unrest, when things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ensures an almost untenable duopoly, which requires a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what new incoming chairman would risk to begin to embark on anything and dismantle an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while this itself might bring about his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if not enough, are also still many interested in the BBC reduced to see - obsolete power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition is getting closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with special risks.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £ 145.50 a year, the British public will buy into the certainly largest media companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: it says that it reaches 96 percent of all households and each of them only 40 pence per day costs.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently increases the BBC on the popularity scale up again: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: nowadays I get news headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Berkeley declared housing market back to "normal"</seg>
<seg id="2">One of the most prominent builders of London pointed out that the housing market in the south east of England was again "returned" to normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were highly coveted and the subject of enormous price increases, which the Bank of England due to the widespread fear moved in front of a credit bubble to put ceilings on mortgage loans in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013", adding that it provided a "stable task environment".</seg>
<seg id="5">The real estate market in London was well placed during the downturn, as foreign buyers thronged to the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information from the land registry, the prices have risen in the metropolitan area alone last year jumped by 18.5 percent, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">Average selling prices for Berkeley's private, inexpensive and student services rose by about one-fifth last year and were the end of April to £ 423,000.</seg>
<seg id="8">A stronger pound has however made less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months real estate property in London - some of them have been put off by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "Villas control" before the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London Estate Agents Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, were presented in the stricter lending rules, would in the second half also lead to lower market growth in terms of real estate sales as in prices.</seg>
<seg id="10">New data from the Bank of England released on Monday showed a decline in the mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the housing market cools.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions International, another real estate agency, downgraded its prediction for the rise in house prices in London in 2015 down to 3 percent, based on an already weakening house price consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington is now every year declined by a quarter, so the broker WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, because the amounts due for forward sales amount to more than 2.2 billion pounds.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, the forward sales have remained stable."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 percent annually to 280 million pounds, while sales rose 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In an announcement on Monday before the annual meeting of the company Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley would probably meet the current market expectations for the current year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Analysts estimate consistently the annual pre-tax profit to 450 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were fixed in the afternoon London trade at 23.96 pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2">They melted away, so you could best describe it, they broke up slowly like a box that you have in the rain leave.</seg>
<seg id="3">Occasionally told him a woman that he was too serious, demanding, intense, distant and perhaps a little crabby.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Crabby he knew.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was prickly as hedgehogs in, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this Stacheligkeit was just incipient affair that had been promising for relieving lonely boredom of his life as usual, and might even have brought him a certain satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart of a village in the North Island, which was even more remote and harsher than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She had come with a previous accompaniment to the south, held the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited in a damp but paradisiacal valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley a lot.</seg>
<seg id="10">For several years no one had lived in the house.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were leaking, were in the bathrooms even spiders, slugs had left their mark on all the windows and thought they owned it all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbages.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like the house of a children's story, both menacing as tempting a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had sat holding hands with Ailinn on the broken sunbeds in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had absentmindedly snapped into the service console with soothing music and calming messages supplied the land, as the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainers, which his father loved listening with closed shutters in the house ,</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">Because of their innate aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not prohibited - Nothing was really banned - just not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been successfully obsolesziert so obsoleszieren like the word.</seg>
<seg id="20">The general taste managed what decrees and regulations have never managed and how people choose books at the From the rags-to-riches memoir, cookbooks and romances, so they chose the ballad with the music.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing big feet in a rough-comic Serenade Ailinns.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he told her and automatically put two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">That his father had always done to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had started out as a game between him and his father when he was young.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, as he had told.</seg>
<seg id="27">When you begin a word with a J, without laying two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was already at that time was not a very fun game and it was now not very funny.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what was jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard what.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvising was no longer modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only room for one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted at the beginning of a tune to be quite sure where they would end up.</seg>
<seg id="36">Likewise, the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And Jazz was musically expressed understanding.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he had become 10 years old without having heard from Sammy Davis Junior, knew Kevern about Jazz from the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At her age, she probably could not remember a time, in the pop singer were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again was, no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A conforming society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - grateful as the spared by fate.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with African-Caribbean origin were eligible by temperament and body type for entertainment and sports, so they sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with such electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning telephone service.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community, taking care of the sewage system; what was left of the Greeks, smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those whose grandparents had not left the country quickly from the Gulf states and the Levant as WAS DONE WAS WHEN IT DONE WAS to be geschah- lest charged fire inciting, for fear even that the flames would consume the next - had Labneh- and shisha pipes restaurants opened, talked and were considering depressed with the inaction.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Since she had only heard ballads, it fell Ailinn hard to understand how the offensive words that had just sung her Kevern, were each set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really offensive," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the false sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the sound of giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father something should love?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to put in her presence again two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">She thought already that it was a little weird.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It seemed to him funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief, blocking Keverns view.</seg>
<seg id="62">It was all over the world to see nothing more than her unkempt black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing he would not otherwise want to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," they mean without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that does not explain why you sing to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed worried honest.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet so not right.</seg>
<seg id="70">Maybe your knuckles, a little bit ...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just that stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said "I love you", but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why I like you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That did not sound right.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was supposed to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">If he was trying to be funny, he brought himself often in trouble because he does not like his father had the soothing charm, the one needed to tame the inherent cruelty in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he wanted, Kevern, be.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from her deck chair, threw to the console and spilled the wine they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderflower wine, so was drunkenness is no excuse for him.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I'm attracted to you pervert," she said ...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for, both because of the unnecessary rudeness of his words as well as the fear that showed in her eyes when she rebelled against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it is essentially so was like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">Here, the same huge and icy ocean broke down as there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and morose after what had happened as it had been their ancestors as a smuggler and beach robbers moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise his hand against a woman who refused to join them or ridiculed ,</seg>
<seg id="94">Dick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a thick fist when she was not looking!</seg>
<seg id="96">They snog only - smooching was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the bland love ballads from the console - they smooch first and then beat.</seg>
<seg id="97">After Keverns view that was an unnecessary refinement since the smooching itself already constituted an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons gave him through her a sign to go.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the deck chair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt too leaden, but the force of his sadness surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They knew each other hardly.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him as he walked away - like from a room upstairs while her companion was watching him - man, weighed down with something that he himself had conjured up.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had their hands raised against them.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from her, bent his back, ashamed, defeated without fighting spirit - why that was a sight she seemed to know well if you still could not remember a single time, in which they anything like this before had seen the day before?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked down at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Several years ago the just told incidents worked Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, on a short presentation about the continued violence in low- and middle-level in exactly those areas, where the reduction, if not elimination have been, most likely to occur, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.</seg>
<seg id="109">"It has already done a lot, and a lot remains to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people led thousands of wars and most of them won, especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country, in where the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically despite the towering steeples between the hedges rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some characteristics turn out to be ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the steeple, it seems, the lower the passion he still wakes.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population is crying while listening to sentimental ballads, drunk with stories about Overcoming difficulties and asserts firmly believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only keeps the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric firmly in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and sneaky contentiousness at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," said her mentor, when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less fiction.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I also have to ask: are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that I need not say," replied Esme walnut.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme invoked their right to privacy and denial of testimony.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">More silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not ask that," Luther Rabinowitz said finally, "because I was against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve an unprejudiced society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of hypersensitivity, which is absolutely acceptable and laudable in itself, can occasionally results as you imagined it, distort.</seg>
<seg id="126">They themselves have obviously prejudices against the Church, and those things that you describe as "sneaky" and "raw" could of course strength and vitality are interpreted by others as well as an expression of.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you continue on the harping, what will happen is when it happened is as if it, if it had happened would have happened yesterday, means the country to take its essential vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme walnut looked around while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head a repeated LED lettering in Flamingo Pink the advice that Ofnow had left the country in the last quarter of a century or longer.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile your neighbors, you cherish your partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to you, you agree to excuse yourself.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I understand completely, what are you getting," Esme Walnut answered in a calm voice, as if she was sure that her boss had finished speaking, "and I say nothing more than that we are not healed as effective as we delude ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that we might find there again without warning us, as we repeat the mistakes that led only to what HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED ever.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time there are not the other, where we leave our anger and our distrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to imply patience of a saint.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "if you act as a" call errors "who our grandparents may or may not have committed.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far, if you say that they had omitted their "anger" and their "distrust" of "other".</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary actually to remember someone in your position that we and "others" speak in understanding the past as in the protection of the present, not by "us".</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "other".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"From when we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "can claim no part of society, to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse no one.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what's done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">This requires nothing more to be said - because we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And must be assigned to exactly how not to blame, as well as any debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is to ensure that we forget.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something to -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz let coincide his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider their report," he said, and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who was passers as described, driven in a "brutal anger" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="2">The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point of the past 13 months, a closely watched study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit purchasing managers' index in the manufacturing sector (PMI) fell in August to 50.7 in, after a reading of 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">An indication over 50 indicates an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia via Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="7">The markets expect the Bank a clear plan for dealing with a faltering recovery in the euro zone as well as the threat of deflation in an inflation rate of only 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation to the fact that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information during the course of this week, if he draws a quantitative relief for the euro area into consideration, according to those that were made by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers have become more apparent," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, fell in the second largest economy of the block, France, the PMI to 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers' index in the manufacturing sector in the euro area in August is that after the sector continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Producers in the euro zone find life at present obviously quite difficult as the current increased geopolitical tensions - particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainties in the continued difficult conditions in many countries enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increased uncertainty have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and presumably results that some jobs may be delayed or even canceled, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="7">The tragedy united West and East in disgust, and then turned, surprisingly, in action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="9">We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, though the memory of that terrorist hell they will pursue forever.</seg>

<seg id="17">My legs were covered in blood.</seg>
<seg id="18">I got up and climbed back inside to look for my mother.</seg>

<seg id="36">The boy, who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion, was his mother dead</seg>
<seg id="37">It was his first day of school (Russians go with 7 years in the school) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">The age of seven, he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.</seg>
<seg id="40">They said to him, "Run."</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearful that she might be dead, he fled and saw on the way a crying infant, took her by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father Vladimir, who joined his son outside in the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I could not save them."</seg>
<seg id="44">In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, turn on the assumption that her son had died.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (from the now defunct News of the World) to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion.</seg>
<seg id="49">"This horror haunting you every day, but I wish I could quit remember," he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">But I can say it is paler in my memory.</seg>
<seg id="51">I remember that I immediately afterwards threw all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I do not think about myself after.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these children with whom I played in the yard, and did not make it out.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they were killed or are dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they have remained in the gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember very well on my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could pick me everything I wanted, and the ride in an open-topped car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he's afraid to place such as Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune that he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror haunting you every day, but I wish I could stop myself to remember.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer from the horrors," said Damir, the last week as a volunteer working in a monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want so much to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I will one day go to the police and hope they take me next year at the Training Academy.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I understood then, as people can understand on the other side of the world, our feelings, and show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was Cherie Blair and her foundation grateful for the price and the possibility to travel to London in autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her yourself, that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting me her and her husband in London, and as the Damir and has helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I still remember how Damir wanted something to eat borscht and they called all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was only one month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Ukraine, the war is now on, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still killing.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are precisely those children like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many of the war is a part of the messages that they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know just what these people feel the whole horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can not stop doing it, to feel it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, the people want to still kill each other and that's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was tall and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the recent atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and there ignite candles.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was small, he suffered - I remember how he sometimes lay down on the bed, her face turned away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not asleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I had a few hours so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I recovered after the blast and got to my feet, I looked around, and saw around hell to me, with all lying about body parts.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived impossible in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I called to him," Damir, run, run away ", but I was so sure he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so life goes on, unlike many others, for us.</seg>

<seg id="95">Trost: The Beslan survivors Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of George today</seg>
<seg id="96">His blood-streaked face was lined with fear as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before they rushed off to bring her elder son Vladimir to the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the farm about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my George managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date gets, the harder it is to remember and talk about it is.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day on which we do not remind us of this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it's a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days haunt me all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Insistently: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was a statue (right) immortalized.</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that George on this day so much wanted to go to school. He said he wanted to hug his teachers.</seg>
<seg id="108">I knew only that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even the statue of the weeping Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George sees the image does not like, and it is hidden in our home on the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that the people around the world thanks to this image feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy says today: "It is important for that to happen it never again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">The people investigating such tragedies again and never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever find out what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world will be something terrible.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can not understand how that's possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I feel it still.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went later in 2004, back to school and had every day anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That is why I always go to the gym when September 1st is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to express my my old childhood friends tribute.</seg>
<seg id="127">It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel as victims, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I do not pity me.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have finished school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm going to be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was a training in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow that.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgy Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy who survived, though he was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was captured during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It really is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it as if it were yesterday," says George, who wanted to go as an intelligence officer for the FSB, but could not do because of health damage caused by the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt after actually a little better, but I can not forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I'd like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time that I went to the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I'll never go back there and do not ask me to show you where I've been sitting in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I wear it every day with me.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like thinking about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically I'm fine.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I could not study at the Secret Service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents, also sent medical and they answered that it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been there already two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "of cats to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">In addition, children should not know anything and they should not suffer it, of course.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">He is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I'll go to the celebrations commemorating.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George will not go there.</seg>
<seg id="165">It still needs to be much more violent for him because he was there and I did not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so thankful to God that he has been returned to me. Here in Beslan are all drawn from it.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to accept that, if a bit so happens Unfair.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports, but he is unable to attend due to his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several times, he can run, but do not exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always haunt us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and the only strengthened my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart weeps for those killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows, who never remarried.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I'll never forget how my heart leaped within me as I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What fight these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why did they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I can not believe almost.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now struggling?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am sure that for many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many are killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could just all grab and throw these Rebels - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="192">The world held its breath in 2004, when the baby Alyona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officers from the siege of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists let them go, but stopped in their cruelty their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar back in the school gymnasium.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which can be had for about $ 300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these photos on a family celebration with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $ 350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are some rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Control your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are sealed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Make. Your camera also on the photos or videos, which you want to record</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and shooting modes with which the exposure time for the dim underwater conditions is optimized.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump into it, check the depth to which your equipment is functional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search through our Buying and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD, allowing you to compose images, Action Cams normally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to consider this under water, and the correct image adjustment is a matter of luck.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you make a lot of shots.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a series mode, with a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings to be made, then use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light is dramatically worse the farther you move away from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, so stay close to the surface, if you shoot in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This allows you to bring more color to your photos; The deeper you go, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Walk up close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is also good advice to country, but he is under water all the more important because of poor lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important when you are working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need closer to your objects if they are to fill the entire image frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advisory anesthetist he devoted his career to the task, both to spare the patients the agony of the disease as well as the anguish of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, so remembers his wife, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors diagnoses and diseases are important, while the treated are mainly busy with something completely different: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, he was the one whose ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel," he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulty to rouse me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he eagerly reproached his wife Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want it all at once rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">As Juliet was for a week on a business trip to Lawson felt quite unusually, and worried for no reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to make an X-ray examination of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks ago he had been in the French Alps for skiing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of X-ray examination was before.</seg>
<seg id="15">He was suffering from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which the pleura, so attacks the lungs be coated skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.</seg>
<seg id="17">For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, lung cancer sufferers all have not been previously smoking.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber building materials, once as a "miracle substance" was but has since been recognized as deadly.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can easily ignore how.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is ultimately a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos was no longer used in Great Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily undertook, this no longer use.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even where it was still used, only people working in certain sectors directly with the substance - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, he now seems to be hardly worrying.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">United Kingdom, it seems, is today experiencing the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in traffic accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and likely future deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999, all types of asbestos prohibited), is that a mesothelioma developed after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the stores where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore knows Mesothelioma no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even in the hospitals where we need not be healthy, have already been identified as initial foci of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was hard indeed to imagine where he could possibly come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found out.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if a lot of asbestos was present in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my education for six years." he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All - students, nurses, doctors and porter - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my peers are suffering from the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately, he could at least partially answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital, and the sick in the past five years to mesothelioma," he wrote in 2010 in a letter, "I am the last one who is still alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us are still ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">At Andrew Lawson mesothelioma was diagnosed at the age of 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55th</seg>
<seg id="49">This was an unusually long survival.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">Therefore, we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still ill"</seg>
<seg id="53">The leading expert of Britain to mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, believed to 1870-2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is expected to grind to a halt, a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim to.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them do not have any idea that they are going to die so at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the records of the courts to which the parties concerned often call for compensation claims, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioma is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June this year Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, to have negligently exposed to asbestos Janice Allen.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years for the chain from 1978 to 1987, was in charge on the clothing department at two sites - one of which is the flagship store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I do not even really knew anything about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that this would affect me times.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the term asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals relates.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name comes from the word "asbestiform" ago, a description of the fiber structure that makes the material resistant and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, which today is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof tiles, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is considered yet by the EU and the WHO as a "major health hazard" or death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crocidolite).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is significant, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer has been suspended in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has conducted a study of those affected submitted, is shown in that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma with no known exposure was probably caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">A majority of these contacts based on his testimony to the "normal use and aging" of our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as if no one could expect to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which has studied the Palace of Westminster shows how people could also have been at the heart of government, unknowingly exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipes were contaminated after the committee rooms of Parliament with asbestos, whose fatal fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".</seg>
<seg id="79">Parliament members are often accused, to look after their own interests, but here it looks like, as would apply to the reverse.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labor Service insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean bill of health", it is now undisputed that must be applied £ 1 billion effort over several years to renovate the Parliament to modernize the electrical systems and the asbestos to remove, and that after the general elections of 2015, the Members will probably take more at the nearby QE2 conference center than on the green benches in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">Anything you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who was able to determine the exposure to asbestos never exactly is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson believed the 50-year-old Abbott that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital, were decided positively in the asbestos litigation," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all the places you've worked, and to the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What did he still remembers the exact day early December 2009, where he got such a kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and led straight late in the evening an operation.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought no longer to create the ride home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, knew Abbott that the pain from the pleura, skin stemmed around his lungs around.</seg>
<seg id="95">But as Janice Allen he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He did not go a month working.</seg>
<seg id="97">Surprised doctors did X-rays of his chest and put on Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health improved slowly, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">However, from time to time, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">2011 was a patient Abbotts with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now it is not joined Abbott in his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The compound in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, equipped with a camera probe was inserted into the cavity between the rib and the pleura.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I'm mostly just continue, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">Frankly, I had not made me so worried.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year before: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott had to take appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of which told him a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now he realized the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, ill now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so mesothelioma will now face younger people who have not worked in the typical occupations.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were more likely not exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who transferred in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson) or ate in canteens underground (as did Graham Abbott often), were most likely in contact with toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It turns out that for several decades after the war hospitals for patients were potentially life-saving, but life-threatening for the attending physicians.</seg>
<seg id="121">He is still far today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students presented their Bunsen burner from asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it concerns not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos has been widely used because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Even schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Throughout the country, thousands of hours chemistry, students have parked their Bunsen burner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">On the subject of asbestos is now websites frequently addressed in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile, have so innocent objects in our homes as floorboards or shed roofs default contain asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It is an industrial poison that in large parts of our real estate is included," remarked Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, was the only contact that occurred an affected woman, the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So beware how you demolish your garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of diagnostics, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process it," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to go on, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew I had to go and I take care of myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I'll see no more Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">With the greatest difficulty was the change in perspective from the position of a doctor to a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information that he had to come to terms.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very hard to take it all," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," as long as I do? "</seg>
<seg id="143">And you gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "Well, I'll see no more Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - the breathing itself - is that caused the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is swirled and the fibers are inhaled, they can relax in the pleura, the skin around the lungs, fix.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with the needle-like asbestos fibers inhaled," said Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic physician who moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="152">Exactly the hospital, from the Andrew Lawson believed that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says Treasure, "they are pushed out of the breathing process to the edge, where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options for other cancers not work as well with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation, for example, been hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can not cut out the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">They come with the knife not around it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, says the cancer "to chemotherapy is not very good," the "effect shows", but does not heal.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients live really long, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after his own diagnosis Graham Abbott is still struggling.</seg>
<seg id="168">Having contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become four years after his diagnosis, a one-man support and advisory office for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, cancer center," he introduced himself with calls happily.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had his diagnosis received 4 years ago and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months and probably prolong his life only by one month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, made it "things to make them appear in a more positive light."</seg>
<seg id="176">After consulting several doctors Abbott, decided his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski continue cardiothoracic specialist at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I did not have to be made, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to get a referral and have to wait for the approval of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to perceive the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments ultimately fail inevitably, are many sufferers of another financial worry - about the future of the families they leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for your health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what in the 1960s has changed, that it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the company began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital made their case finally at, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation", as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was attributed to asbestos a contact at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">After investigating his death a spokesman for the Guy's, but confirmed that "the asbestos fibers have been removed in the affected basement area in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">Indeed, it is for mesothelioma sufferers who seek to compensation, an enormous problem, assign the deadly asbestos contact a company or workplace - usually decades after the events.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employer have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, there was this year significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers easier to sue for compensation, even if their former employer are not to be found.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has a funded by the insurance industry fund of £ 350 million set for all who have been diagnosed by June 2012, be able to demonstrate a contact, but can sue anybody.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the applicants will receive 80 percent of what a court in an ordinary lawsuit for damages they could award - about 120,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="197">Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers that £ 350 million represented a "very good job" in the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"That's a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that it is this amount to a quarter of these, which insurers would have paid if the time would not ignore gone above and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they might accuse normal.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, the then Work and Pensions Minister, admitted that the law "not perfect" is.</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning as Morgan agreed that in view of seven deaths a quick action is necessary daily.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people are suffering so much and need help now," said Penning during the second consultation of the mesothelioma law in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this point, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first consultations Long-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which it expects a positive effect unlike Tom Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, with the Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate for five years of up to 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is of course with the most important thing," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">This can be seen repeatedly in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There's something that keeps you going up.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you give up, you're doing very rapidly worse.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">He had the end of August the last of six chemotherapy cycles behind.</seg>
<seg id="213">Aftercare scans showed no signs of disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several cancer-spots around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50th</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">That's lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now no trace of the tumor longer visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think of practical things - about the money, if I'm not, for example, or my wife to show how the boiler timing works.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you get bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You must look to the future.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father of Ellie, 16 and Tamsin, 14, which is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"For parents, the difficulties," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They had varying reactions.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.</seg>
<seg id="231">They told their friends and soon we got a lot of calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">They did not say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something that have to go through all cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not permeated by hope, not a trace of hope of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease brings (as ultimately also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses Hong Kong law on government election, protesters vow retaliation</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms decided against the nomination of candidates for the elections in 2017 by the Hong Kong electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably fired the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization to within hours of the announcement in the way.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress will allow the Communist leaders in principle, reject all non Beijing loyal candidates.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">You lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of China's decision said Li Fei, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that allowing public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government to "chaotic" would.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government presided from 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision of Sunday as a democratic breakthrough because it gives the citizens of Hong Kong direct suffrage, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership firmly maintains the flow through a controlled closely by Beijing nominating committee in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to a new clause also should only candidates are admitted "with love of country and love for Hong Kong".</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest protests in Hong Kong and publikumswirksamsten held for several years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the movement Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to foreclose the financial district, if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night gathered within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning a protest wave in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they did this, no further details, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online message, the organizers stated that the movement "has drawn the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted and no alternative exists.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sorry to have to say that all dialogue opportunities have been explored today, and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days to the announcement in Beijing, and there were on Sunday in front of the government building more stringent security measures, including police officers and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increased competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the fear grows that the values ​​of Hong Kong begin as democracy and freedom of speech under the growing pressure Beijing to crumble.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement as it business operations - the lifeline of Hong Kong - hazardous.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, of which they speak, could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, which has long criticized the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want stoke fears that Hong Kong out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">The state-controlled media in China also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as controlled by Western powers subversive agents.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer organized an unofficial referendum activists to the voting rights, where 780,000 people took part - over a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, do not shoot," while she waited outside the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After her experience set white feminist commentators sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">While tensions in the Midwest but rose and across the country were given attention, saw Perez that the responses of white women turned to 100% to the breed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays came with titles such as "thought to Ferguson by a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not think there are many people in the feminism that will be on the White and speaking privileges on such high-class kind," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt urged to express something to the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnicized that you need to express that.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English Professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University Ferguson brought problems to light, which black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered to be "women's issues" in the cultural space.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something about how Colored stand in their own country under siege, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to speak publicly about a relationship, but not on safety in public places?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">Have studied in US history for black women as Mitchell, the race, gender and sexuality, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them, black women have not had the luxury of the issues cleanly separate; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now join the race and gender issues in the mainstream feminist circles, says Angela Hattery, Professor of Women's and Gender Studies at George Mason University that her predecessors were doing the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery the split between white and black women came to the point where the white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and found that the struggle for the right to vote a on each group could be successful: women or black.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks was to come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If one remembers such things, one realizes with power, why black women white women do not dare.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have our job not done well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women organized against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman Hanes Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help on the part of black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time, where white feminists "catch" toyed with the problems faced by black women sat down for generations apart.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Would not it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms the right to education of a child would take as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation who have built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting death of Michael Brown on Facebook and published an incisive article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist of the Guardian, in which it calls for more protests of white Americans against racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason to understand a body inherent danger - and views on race that are significantly different in public polls - will lead the changes," wrote Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism, are addressed in the race as well as gender issues, some are still baffled by their comments on the race issue in America.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" She told The People that young men in the United States, especially young black men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem comments on Ferguson standing in contrast to her earlier criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently released a small program, My Brother's Keeper, hung up to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police have seized nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwest border of the country this year, the topic of immigration reform comes to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, Co-Chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women's issue, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants who are the women who accompany them, in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find an echo in the women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Leonidas asked in the gladiatorial arena</seg>
<seg id="2">Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in mud at the first Rheinbacher Römertag at the amusement park.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the attraction of the event was strong enough yesterday to attract more than 1,000 visitors who braved the rain and the autumn cold and were inspired by the historic spectacle completely.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a varied selection of images, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis" that this took every rain break to demonstrate their robust combat art in the prepared with soft sand arena.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gladiator Owner "Leonidas" turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent one after his men in the ring for the heroic battle in different categories of gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="7">First were the "Provocatoren" turn with rectangular shield and short sword and leg splint on his left leg and arm splint on his right arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and spear throwing and iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm.</seg>
<seg id="9">Particularly impressive was the performance of "Retiarius", who took with cast net, trident and dagger against the "Secutor" and after a brief struggle pushed the boy to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the swords crashed together metallic, shields rattled and the lances flew buzzing through the arena that was a fear and worry are the health of the gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="11">But on who had the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, an ever vigilant eye.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to revive the Roman life again and the culture of the Roman period make tangible," said Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Friends Romans channel", the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation, was out of the theme park for a day a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman town, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his welcoming speech.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we admire today.</seg>
<seg id="15">Remnants of which were to be admired even when Römertag, about "Aqueduct-marble" of the eleven meter high and 1400 meter long Roman Canal Bridge, which was one day at Lüftelberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Frontinus-Gesellschaft presented the water and energy supply then and now over, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We are moving today benefit from the knowledge of the past".</seg>
<seg id="17">This is confirmed by a graduate surveyor Ralph saint from "engineering team Two" from Rheinbach, the surveying instruments of the Romans as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra imagined.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Roman Villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 and bricks from the original hypocausts, the warm air heating, which was once the Roman villa heated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Impressive also the footprints that had been left by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of sound before burning them.</seg>

<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA-society," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I got to say, I was shocked and fell terribly panicked.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought that I would be 18 in a wheelchair and die with 25, and would slowly lose in between all my skills.</seg>

<seg id="6">The state and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 percent to 671 billion $ to, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of declining assessments in 2009 and 2010 ,</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose more sharply than the local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenues of the District, 56 percent comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of the revenue from Maryland's undertakings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia scored 28 percent the lowest tax revenue from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in property values ​​of companies, researchers, which resulted in an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent say.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large part of these gains came from large states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be true also for the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid about $ 10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to 9.6 billion dollars 2012 - an increase during the year by 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in housing values ​​is in Maryland is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenues because the property taxes amount here on just over one fifth of the tax assessments of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"The following occurs in Maryland: a large part of real estate, particularly in the tax area to DC, is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely for example much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services may be offered by other States.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent rebound in tax revenues by companies can not be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporate income seem to recover well, the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported on income tax in the state organizations of $ 2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $ 1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies not rise evenly in all three locations.</seg>
<seg id="22">The rate of increase in the District corresponded with 4.3 percent the national average, while the increase in Maryland was markedly higher, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has 6 per cent in all three official areas which significantly lowest corporate income tax (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District at relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the US Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia less state and local business taxes are required and a better overall control climate prevails as in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study, the District has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages Virginia is pressurized by its southern neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has adopted legislation to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to achieve its income targets in the coming year, this bill could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the state until 2017 up to 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems the small businesses in the Washington area better to go, and therefore they pay more state and local taxes, as the most recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes, which are paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transition structure, according to which the majority of small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion dollars, a significant faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes in total.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the rise will probably continue in the corporate tax rates across the country this year, with an increase in general More Wehr tax revenues for the state and the local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nevertheless, the Washington area could lag if the spending cuts the federal government affects the labor market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hops and malt - even in China a popular combination.</seg>
<seg id="3">German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankfurt's twin city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes to direct air link between the two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent desire of the officials in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the Deputy Party Secretary of the southern Chinese city, Li Yiwei, at this week's visit to a SPD delegation in his city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Again and again the functionaries of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the Twelve million inhabitants in the course of the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is known in Germany as well as Canton, is one of the richest cities in China, Li recruited.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, the people possess the purchasing power to be able to afford German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German politicians delegation, told the host that he would ask around in Germany to a potential partner for the project.</seg>
<seg id="11">"For beer it does not take much: good water, cereal and vitality," he added at the lunch with the party leaders in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">This joie de vivre already radiate from Mr. Li, he flattered the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then came the official from Guangzhou with Schäfer-Gumbel - but with red wine, which was served at the meal.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German art of brewing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More business</seg>
<seg id="17">A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said vice-party leader Li.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Lufthansa flight previously offered, but painted in 2012 for economic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be worth it again," says the local politician is convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The commerce between our two cities will always continue to".</seg>
<seg id="21">Currently, travelers have to detour through Changsha in Hunan Province take complained Li.</seg>

<seg id="23">The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats to the fore.</seg>

<seg id="29">Even the local party chief Wan Qinglian had to go.</seg>
<seg id="30">The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in party and government, which is enforced by Xi Jinping President with hardness.</seg>
<seg id="31">The new leaders Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a top official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW built a great work.</seg>
<seg id="33">Frankfurt is officially received more than a dozen twinning.</seg>
<seg id="34">The connection to 9000 kilometers from Guangzhou is one of those, which are maintained by both sides, as a student exchange.</seg>
<seg id="35">Last year, the 25th anniversary of Sino-German Connection was celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="36">The southern Chinese city on the Pearl River is their purchasing power, almost as strong as all of Hesse.</seg>
<seg id="37">The next year she hopes to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $ 1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON confirmed just what information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $ 1.04 billion (970 million USD).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had a takeover of Twitch expected but because it was widely believed that YouTube would acquire the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it looked as if the sale of Twitch to the video service of Google decided for a cool billion thing, and cooperation also appeared naturally.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, a "YouTube for live games," said an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "Let's Play", a video genre, the (mostly older) give in the alls play an air of secret science theater, are on YouTube already very popular.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube is often referred to when describing Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy, received a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not successfully, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we know right now about this statement of Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values ​​and long-term visions and they want to help us quickly get there. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me who declare that they prefer to play sports than watch her, it's hard to understand the attraction, which assumes watch others play themselves instead of taking the control console in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's one thing to a friend by 3 clock in the morning to look over his shoulder as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner in how he is shot 20 times in succession in Call of Duty in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">All these games you could now watching.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so the Watching without their own control over the viewing perspective may be a really good recipe for a headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the quick runs in the complete the Roger Bannister of our electronic age all the games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as not a game or a virtuoso humor is going to be Twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what the skeptics as I know it already?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly will Amazon make it money?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video, like YouTube Twitch just could swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something that every business would like to have: thousands of young men who are being courted as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the media shows no signs of shrinking, not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the bouncy castle at the garden party on Saturday was a lot going on.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organizers agreed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite strong downpour on Saturday night an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">At times, had to be stopped the intake.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel l light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the Open Air in Burggarten Salzwedel should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, the fun comes by themselves anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was evident already early Saturday, when the first visitors encouraging respect for Open Air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A festival for all generations had promised the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply stands in the castle garden meadow it had Salzwedeler, but also guests from near and made himself comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="14">They followed the first live performances, bobbing his foot in time, enjoyed cool drinks - in short, pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.</seg>
<seg id="15">And across the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While lounging on a blanket on the extra-angekarrten white sand at the beach, others feasting on a quarter of wine in the wine cellar, the young raged on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the younger guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even when face painting, volunteers had their hands in the truest sense of the word fully to control the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The older children took advantage of the table soccer or participated in a skateboard workshop, to the Good Foot crew from Salzwedel hosted.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17.30 clock he pelted down on the visitors, especially families ran away and dryness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the attractiveness of the feast did no harm.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, the "success across the board" spoke of a.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore a repetition of the big party next year precludes anything.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although necessary to work more on content and size of the event, Sem made in a first record on Sunday against the People's voice clearly.</seg>
<seg id="25">When angry he described that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security firm had been booked with insufficient forces.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result: Some who had already paid were no longer on the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first tentative estimate of Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1200 visitors who cavorted in the Burggarten said.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound equipment.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore Salzwedeler hip hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke her appearance from exasperated.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned hookah lounges could not be established because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a flat tire.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Next year, however, they are doing", said the organizer.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of Amula Open Air was visits more than succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers have made some mistakes that are forgiven the first time yet, but must be disposed of in the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the social network Facebook, organizers must take criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve euros you expected more," said Melanie Meier expresses at the event page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have taken a bit sadly," Ele Carpenter says in the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others see the initial problem is not quite as tight.</seg>
<seg id="42">I find it very good that some not only talk stupid, but really try to put something together.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hats off! "Stephanie writes for Jenß Amula.</seg>

<seg id="1">Tighten the castle clubs soon join forces?</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently there have been quarrels between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the board members think about possible cooperation after.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser castle led by the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser castle Friends at the project in French Guédelon.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, there was not a good climate between the castle and the castle club friends Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pronounced seemed different so far the positions should be how to deal with the history of Wolfratshauser castle and a possible reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two camps to move toward each other: It will be soon held discussions on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is confirmed by the club directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burg friends) on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I called and suggested that we could sit down together once Mr. Piffl" says Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, all the members of both teams could continue pulling back together.</seg>
<seg id="11">So were recorded faster visible results.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle Friends at the sudden death of Richard Dimbath until recently had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye, is the castle club Sjöberg the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the site at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, Vice Chairman of the castle and friends has been very pleased by its own account on the call.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death he stands in front of the castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found in mid-September in a general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently the association has, according to the 74-year-olds around 40 members.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we leave the association's activities rest out of respect first." This "thinking phase" was necessary in order "to consider how it could go on."</seg>
<seg id="18">According Piffl the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Castle Club.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the castle and friends might also make an impression of the mood within their grouping.</seg>
<seg id="20">A candidate for the presidency, there is not currently says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone will find". He himself does not want to run, because they are domiciled in Bad Toelz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer wanted in the project "but very happy to cooperate."</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view when it comes to reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes Piffls in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">It commends Dimbath as "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">A high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from around the world they are a tourist attraction.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I too was skeptical at first.</seg>
<seg id="29">But over time I am more and more come to the conclusion that it makes sense to move the project forward. "It could a" unique selling point "for Flößerstadt be created.</seg>
<seg id="30">There nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, the project by EU grants, admission tickets and potential sponsors would be financed, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of ​​reconstruction so I will personally do not simply throw overboard". He hoped that the castle club in this point may move slightly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal, the history documented first, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clever ways to save money at university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">As the cost of college textbooks for many students be more than 1,000 dollars per year, the fast second semester student Matt Schroeder considered a clever saving idea.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a lending system for books written by graduate students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the return sales.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My math book normally costs 180 $, but I got it for $ 10 for one semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $ 430, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $ 120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The college management said that students on average spend more than $ 1,200 a year for textbooks and study material, but that it would be several cost-containment options for students.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online shops and creative approaches as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of textbooks has doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Polls in the industry show that about a quarter of the books was hired in the college bookstores last spring semester, said Vice President Neebos Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks to buy, according to the trade association National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's the basics for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buy Online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books cost online, only a third of the price for which they are to have the campus bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $ 290, however, may be obtained from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $ 239.99.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy Used</seg>
<seg id="18">If one notes the other or normal signs of use do not mind, used books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is used to Chegg.com for $ 93.49 to have.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, graduating student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions:. Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business"</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was sold new for $ 48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to ask their professors if earlier editions are admissible.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates for the term papers are not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.</seg>
<seg id="25">Except Chegg and Amazon also Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rent</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and after completing the course does not want to keep the books.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" no blockbuster was</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played a less $ 30 million of its $ 90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only grossed $ 12 million of its budget of 70 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tailored Cameron Diaz film "Sex Tape" played on the opening weekend a merely $ 14.6 million, while children's films like "Train Your Dragon 2" also disappoint in revenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children's films, the lack of quality of the films could be the reason itself.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin called 2014 "the worst year" for children's films to date, describing "Train Your Dragon 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">In films for a slightly older audience, it seems, however, as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Metacritic rating for each summer theatrical release, which has been shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year at least 2,000 screens.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results are based on the opinion of moviegoers and film critic and suggest that this year's hit movie of last year which are equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services like Netflix.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's forthcoming Jungle Book film, compared to the Hollywood Reporter website said: "I think the times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to accept that and not try to run after the past.</seg>
<seg id="12">Unlike the currently weak cash results of the Hollywood productions Netflix posted recently sales to streaming content in the amount of $ 1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales totaled $ 837 million.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they become very concentrated on film adaptations of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="14">Viewed in light of the current downturn, argue some commentators that his gloomy prophecy could well contain a kernel of truth.</seg>
<seg id="15">Due to the expected in the summer 2015 blockbuster potential, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, however, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:</seg>
<seg id="16">The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, the decline in cash results recently described as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and no one is more concerned about the financial worries make. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Hütteldorfer after second win of the season in third place in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">With the 2: 0 over Grödig has taken a conciliatory end on Sunday for a bitter Rapid week.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team reached the off in the Europa League on Thursday an interim low.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed Captain Steffen Hofmann and scorer who pushed forward with green and white in third place.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to winning ways Rapid has shown with the second win of the season the right response to the disappointment to Helsinki and goes with a sense of achievement in the international break.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive response," said full-back Thomas Schrammel, who has paved the way to victory with his splendid leadership volley from Sechzehnereck after 14 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought, I hau the frustrations of Thursday pure and smacked him under the bar," the 26-year-old said with a smile.</seg>
<seg id="8">Had met as Schrammel 13 Novmember 2010. so far the last time in a Bundesliga game that was still for Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first Championship goal in Rapid's suits will therefore remain in his special remembrance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the Rapid-junior" Schrammel said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short-term pelvic Blessur Mario Pavelic moved Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also made a very good job there.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has enough experience that he can exercise this position reversed.</seg>
<seg id="13">He deserved the goal he has this year already made some assists "praised Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character Schrammel also supplied the cross for 2: 0 by Hofmann after the hour, which finally brought the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because before that might well have write the guests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we have had some luck today," remarked also Schrammel, who thus alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but playfulness has always been good compared to last year" ,</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic was even that one "in many games before better than today" was - against "the strongest team that has played this season in this stadium."</seg>
<seg id="18">The first three Punkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure was intact despite the setbacks, "Today my team has shown that it has character."</seg>
<seg id="19">For him, no less gratifying: "The fact that we finally played back to zero".</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of work during international break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger multiple failures are to be deplored, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their Startelfdebüts, the victory makes even more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"One must not forget," Barisic, with Behrendt and Pavelic players lost in the past three days, "which were very stable lately" admonished.</seg>
<seg id="22">The international break should thus be used to "to lick wounds and a bit zuzulegen in the physical realm," said Barisic who has five Under-21 players in its ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">One, the break probably comes particularly located, Captain Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="24">He tears up for the team, going through pain over it.</seg>
<seg id="25">In this difficult period, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "stated Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann gave the Rapids game before being substituted in the 68th minute, not only the structure but also scored the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year-old who completed his 350th Bundesliga match, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 over the Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "Can not believe that now everything is good" "We've certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the luck must come back to us as well.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was high time, "Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="30">He warned course to concentrated Next work: "One must not always see the black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have in recent weeks played not as bad as has been shown.</seg>
<seg id="32">But we must not also believe that now everything is good.</seg>
<seg id="33">The importance of his role for the team, he could not deny.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's a very young team, I can help at the moment very much.</seg>
<seg id="35">The talk in certain phases but at me to ", Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to reproach.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the quick goal "from the category magic door", as well as the regular gate of Nutz in the 40th minute which was disallowed by referee Kollegger wrongly.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism that I can make the team is that we in some stages were not concrete enough towards the goal.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since we have had too little accounts.</seg>
<seg id="40">Centre Back Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It has the same bad start, then we have found but pure, and even scored a goal.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the whole would have been possible more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demanded from Kiev, the recording of "statehood talks" with the Eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin asked Russian media reports said on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government to end the fighting against separatists in the east of the country and receives directly with negotiations to "rule" the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskov was later clear that Putin had not meant that under the control of the separatist region of eastern Ukraine, a part of Russia will, but that his status towards Ukraine should be redefined to the Russian-speaking region the power to to provide representation of its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's call to the Kiev government to negotiate on equal terms with the pro-Russian rebel fits however since the start of the riots five months ago apparently pursued by him strategy: helping the separatists in taking of territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed Region Novorossija to allow de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture held by separatist territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea had annexed on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have called the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "New Russia" lately, a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those who hope in the course of campaigns Ukrainian politicians for the elections on Oct 26, and during the reign of groups to attack civilian communities in the areas held by separatists for early peace talks "caught in its illusions" are reported Itar -Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We need to immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the state status of East Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's reference to the law in the context of greater autonomy must be seen to be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government may grant the eastern parts of the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it's not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin speaker to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of the Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far greater difficulty, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine to annex, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the period before the conflict resulted in a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats in international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and so the Kremlin effectively give control of an area that the Russian territory with the Crimea connects.</seg>
<seg id="15">The annexed five months ago peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy and an important trading port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture key components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his inauguration speech on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after elections - should consider additions to the Constitution, with which the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of the languages ​​is given.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of ​​autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, their armament and incitement Moscow accused.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatists leaders at eye level, followed by a further advance of the rebels in the past week after Russian troops and tanks invaded over the previously peaceful areas along the Sea of ​​Azov in the eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-backed separatists took by surprise, which is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, according to Ukrainian security official fears that control of Novoazovsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of this massive civil and military preparations are under way to fasten a steel industry Mariupol port with 500,000 inhabitants, lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are nearing a point at which there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit decided any concrete actions that leadership demanded the design of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to retreat in Ilowajsk from their positions after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donezkregion to support the beleaguered separatist, Colonel Andrei Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council reports said on Saturday in Kiev ,</seg>
<seg id="27">The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.</seg>
