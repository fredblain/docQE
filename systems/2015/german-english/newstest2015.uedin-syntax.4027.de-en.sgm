<seg id="1">Going back to the American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Die, die as unions and the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice-chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">So I am proud, together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee Ermächtigungsgesetz before.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of the national labor law, to create an opportunity for discriminating against abandoned workers to organize a union representation, to bring to justice in a civilian court - and to receive compensation or criminal money - is a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - certainly not by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks, which were exposed to the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - to have encouraged Americans once countries around the world to recognise labour rights and respect.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time in which millions of Americans remember, when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution, which should ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. "</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers would have to organize and should raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause, which explicitly testified: "The right to form associations to secure and improve labor and economic conditions will guarantee every individual and every profession or trade.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed to are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">As other countries in this country could advised how to shape civilian and democratic societies, told Americans that the right to the establishment of a union - and that the union could then take part in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights in America come under attack, it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fifty years ago, as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said:</seg>
<seg id="21">The story is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now all know that the labor movement is not suppressing the strength of the nation, but they grew.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Forget those who attack the work these simple truths, but they kept the story.</seg>
<seg id="25">The story recalls, and we should do this.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of the work rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representatives - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and the promise of democracy einlösten.</seg>

<seg id="1">Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force the closure</seg>
<seg id="2">A US federal judge stopped on Sunday for the implementation of a law in Louisiana, the lawyers say that it probably would have led to the closure of the state's five abortion clinics.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure, which was raised from Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana, in June to the law and to enter into force on Sep 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient receiving right in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being, while they apply for such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs can continue to work according to the law, as they seek to obtain these rights," John deGravelles federal judge wrote in his ruling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Within a month, scheduled a hearing for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors gained more time to gain rights to hospital admissions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escape a devious law that they want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics, in order to stop the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling also extended to the doctors from two hospitals, which has not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for the rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws and courts have recently declared unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi for such measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key points of a law in Texas, which would have forced the closure of most of the remaining clinics in the state, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion supporters and the American College of Ostretricians and high impact violence, as well as the American Medical Association say unanimously that the rights of doctors are demanding unnecessary restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="13">Keep abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the impact of a closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has Patienteineinweiserechte, told the center for reproductive rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state be forced to carry out any more abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation out of fear for his safety, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In their arguments against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortion, while their applications on Pati duck against rights were still pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatments lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.</seg>
<seg id="2">Angelina Jolie and her brother James have online a video tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="3">For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.</seg>
<seg id="4">Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, where ovarian cancer was found in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="5">The research director Susan Jordan from QIMR mountain Hofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="6">A small study: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers studied the health care of women over seven years.</seg>
<seg id="8">Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing previous illnesses, as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.</seg>
<seg id="9">For older women and those whose cancer was already at a more advanced stage at diagnosis time, the survival rate was the lowest.</seg>
<seg id="10">For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was about 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the study was not investigated why women living outside the city with a higher likelihood died of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claimed a late diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.</seg>
<seg id="12">"This disease is best dealt with by gynaecological oncologists, and these are usually found in major cities," she said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counter the distances they had flown as a possible remedy for a strengthening of the service to provide doctors, in order to give the opportunity to specialists, women closer to their place of residence, and treatment programs for people outside their region.</seg>
<seg id="14">Dr. Jordan said that the study showed a poor long-term survival rate for women with ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and emphasized the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.</seg>
<seg id="15">The study funded by Rio tinto Ride to conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.</seg>
<seg id="16">In March 2013 Beaufort Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the Gold Coast learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned back to the schools on Monday, after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar fire went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the schools remained closed, while the area is recovering from the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="3">The school start brought communities in southern Israel drawn by the rocket shot holes with a sense of joy and expectation, but the signs of the battles are still fresh.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the southern city of Ashdod remote employees of the "Pashosh" -Kindergartens, which was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of pupils shrapnel shards from the walls and sliding walls.</seg>
<seg id="5">"We have a little bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, Anwohnerin in the caves of Saad and local English teacher.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many children in our area urgently need a return to a routine.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit strange" suddenly to go back to school.</seg>
<seg id="8">"These were difficult times, and we have not even gone out of the house," she said.</seg>
<seg id="9">President Johns Hopkins researchers Rivlin visited the caves near the border with Gaza, in order to offer his support.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until a cease-fire in the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to safer areas further removed from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many residents of Ein Oz, a town near the border with Gaza, a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still with the return.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.</seg>
<seg id="14">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a border town to Gaza, which is badly scarred by Palestinian fire.</seg>
<seg id="15">He appealed to the children to learn a lot, and said "we will make sure that you get their knowledge and offer security."</seg>
<seg id="16">Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday on a permanent cease-fire.</seg>
<seg id="17">The cease-fire caused an immediate end to the fighting; important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.</seg>
<seg id="18">Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="20">More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="21">Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but presented no concrete evidence for this information.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, the majority in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="24">Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been turned into temporary protection areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues, the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.</seg>
<seg id="27">"I hope that the school is open again soon, so that we can continue to learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father has never taken me in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Has never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father died when he was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was difficult to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, only heard his voice: "Hearing with the crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Let your sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Beweg you!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now a little brighter, but they are dark, cheapest, deep stygische maze with flames shock and smoke and soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him has been growing.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when my mother went badly towards the end of their lives, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you '.</seg>
<seg id="24">By his own daughter Billie, Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you let's stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Hearing but to embrace me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I am 22.</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why shouldn't we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why shouldn't we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I was very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you have to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet, in order to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's career change is perhaps evident in his elegant, short cut.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece, he is captured by the theater.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years, when he was working in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="49">He was at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star on television, and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 in New Faces</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the stage right to the Black and White alternatively show, a light entertainment, in which the people "black anmalten," Henry led to his comedy there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family was very unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="54">Somehow, I wish that it would never happen, but I regret that I have done it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">With the introduction of characters, which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like, when you're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage at the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had great fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.</seg>
<seg id="66">It is not a bad thing, if you don't know what you talk to.</seg>
<seg id="67">Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That is what is at stake, it is a serious thing, take them seriously, your text, recherchiere wrote a bit.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They simply do not seem to expect a car accident, and this happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon joined in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you." "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A small voice told me" You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage director announced that the idea would continue once the problem is solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said 'Oh, thank God. "</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for it.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, so stay in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in fences on je Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">The text for fences to learn was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, that strengthens tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">It also sold well, so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say, 'This is your destiny. ""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, with a thundering voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I will say it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly people imitated.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you are looking for the swearing, leaves it against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want it, but overall, I am not as much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again.</seg>
<seg id="99">So is this his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It is fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tells a story, and this is great.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>

<seg id="5">The Snezka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his home country.</seg>
<seg id="7">Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau / North Bohemia, Trutnov today.</seg>
<seg id="8">At 14 he was himself after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession.</seg>
<seg id="9">A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.</seg>

<seg id="12">So it convinces judges to the Upper FRÄNKISCHE reduce village.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher education took place in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manfred Richter six times per week run 10 kilometers to the next station, had to travel by train to Bamberg, where three kilometres across the entire city to go to school and back in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, Manfred judge a sleeping opportunity in a Red Cross shelter in Bamberg, along with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951, he made the first and the second state examination in 1954 after three years teacher candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Since Upper Franconia had no free teacher point for him, he applied himself to Upper Bavaria and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Miss-room," was his first "service" in the school house.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958, he was a three-bedroom apartment in new buildings teacher house next to the school.</seg>
<seg id="20">This house bought Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school had been dissolved in Kollbach 1968.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the meantime, there were three classes in school association Peter Mitte Kollbach and Peter, five in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="22">From the 1968 / 69 school year they were grouped into Peter Mitte in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the school board was founded in Indian village, remained only the primary school in the village.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to avoid a downgrading in the smaller school, the former chancellor George Sigl switched to Karl field - and Manfred Richter, his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Peter (grew, and so were the children and their teachers from September 1982 to today's construction, which was expanded after a judge retirement in 1997.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred judge praises the generosity of then-Mayor Ludwig Götz, built on local costs in a basement workroom and enlargement of 1997, although this was not eligible for co-financing under the guidelines for school buildings.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Götz was very friendly," recalled are grateful to judges.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative, who had responded to a unit of a school Council on Law and Justice: "We must never forget the love." Manfred Richter began with what he had heard a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"You must consider the two children: Roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to learn: "Do not always succeed." Whether he thinks his students, or just his own six children, is not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If students apply to 1993, got it from him not a criminal work and were also ordered not to sit.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the community, judges had two pairs Boxhandschuhe upgrade and left the two sides compete, even if it should be a violet.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the sake of the school used judges as rector a good relationship for then-Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">This was the partyless judge after his retirement in 1996 to stand at least as last on the CSU list for the council.</seg>
<seg id="36">But judges was selected at number six and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Rona fair Head, perhaps the BBC has found a great director, which it needs.</seg>
<seg id="2">It is with a proud fame than from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own front experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began in the global management consulting firm bain and Co., as they moved to Morgan Stanley, BOMBA canoe, ICI and the media world of pear's.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was board chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and came back as the top post of the parent company went pear's to a younger male colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their compensation was supposedly almost £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Their political ranking is sound.</seg>
<seg id="8">David Cameron has been recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as it searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: She was a consultant to the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">In May, I described the job of chairman with a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex entity in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust works in two directions: Inside on the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also to the outside world as the voice of public concern and anxiety, if things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This makes for an almost unsustainable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the incoming chairman would risk it, to stand on everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he is perhaps even about his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if that were not enough, even many are keen to see the BBC reduced - overtaken power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition is approaching old and new technologies threaten comfortable collateral is the upcoming trial of royalties for the BBC with special risks.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145,50 per year, the British public is certainly the largest media company in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: She says that they reached 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence per day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently, the BBC on the popularity scale back up: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The vision for the BBC and usage habits have changed: I get news headlines today on my mobile phone and see missed programmes later on the iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a very considerable and beloved institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">It needs a considerable chairman - I hope she has found him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the democratic district prosecutor, which is the focus of a criminal indictment against him for abuse of authority.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry's account of the previous abstritt.</seg>

<seg id="7">Although the tweets of Perry's official account were, it was not clear who actually used the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the previous tweet was painted an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary clay mountain, who was convicted for drink-driving in April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry, a veto against a financial support of their offices when they refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - could be the possible 2016 presidential candidate - this month before a grand jury in Austin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The text of the tweets reads: "I shall not always drunk with the triple permissible alcohol... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clay's office was not charged with the direction of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political ploy.</seg>
<seg id="15">His high-class team of legal assistance requested by the judge tasked with the case, and reject the prosecution argued that the law that action is taken against the most senior governor in the history of the state of Texas is diffuse in every version.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry stopped $7.5 million in state money to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and determined in cases of corruption in Texas, as clay mountain refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">This veto caused a public complaint by a watchdog group on the left.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.</seg>
<seg id="19">After he had finished fifth in the 2012 election rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy, Perry went on speculation that he would stop, he posted a tweet a photo of themselves while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"</seg>

<seg id="1">BERKELEY said housing market back to "normal"</seg>
<seg id="2">One of London's most prominent developers pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England returned to normal levels "."</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were hotly sought and subject to huge price increases, which led to the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble, in June to put limits on mortgage loans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of high-class Bauunternehmens Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013," and added that this is a "stable environment" offer.</seg>
<seg id="5">The housing market in London was well positioned during the downturn, because foreign buyers pushed in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the register office, prices in the city alone jumped last year increased by 18.5 percent, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling prices of Berkeleys private, cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a stronger pound has made property in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "villas" tax before the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London estate agent Foxtons warned that the mortgage market report for April, which were introduced stricter lending rules in the past week, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales as the prices in the second half of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Bank of England on Monday new data show a decline in the mortgage approval in July, which also indicates that the housing market is cooling.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised down its forecast for the rise in house prices in London for 2015 to 3 per cent, on the basis of an already flagging house price consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction volume in London's most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington is now has fallen by a quarter year on year, according to the real estate agent wa Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon to Berkeley, because the sums due to date sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the futures sales remained stable."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the 2007 peak before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent to £280 million, sales at 18 per cent to £1.6 billion annually.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a statement on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley in the current year would be expected to comply with the current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Analysts estimate in the annual pre-tax profit to £450 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">BERKELEY shares were trading in the afternoon in London at £23,96.</seg>

<seg id="5">Kratzbürstig knew it.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was stachelig, such as hedgehogs, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of the sting was just starting the affair had been promising for a reduction of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and he might even have brought a degree of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomon's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">They had come with an older accompaniment to the south, held the Kevern for her aunt, and had inherited a property in a damp but heavenly valley with the correct name Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over several years, no one had lived in the house.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were taking, in the bathrooms were still spinning, nudibranchs had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, it looked like a huge cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like the house from a children's tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had sat with Ailinn Händchen contestants on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, both had a spirit absent slotted into the console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news crossed as the sight of her brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, and his father had listened in closed shutters in the House.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too great.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was really banned - just not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was successfully obsolesziert, such as the word obsoleszieren.</seg>
<seg id="20">The general taste, which had never managed decrees and regulations, and how people vote in books, the memoir From-dish washer-to-millionaire cookery books and romantic novels, they chose the ballads in the music.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn do not understand this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a well-known song called a jazz pianist Fats Waller," he told her, and will automatically put two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">That his father had always done, in order to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he says.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you put a word with a J website offpage without two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very funny game, and it was also not very funny now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what was jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard what.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">This was no longer of improvisation.</seg>
<seg id="34">It was the only place for a single "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody, where they would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">As well as the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he was 10 years old, without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz of the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he had to Ailinn not declare that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At their age, they probably could not remember a time, in the Popsänger were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">That was again no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every element of this society is grateful for the principle of groups agreed with talent, as the fate spared them.</seg>
<seg id="44">People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports, so sang and ran them.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service.</seg>
<seg id="46">Still, what was left of the Polish community cared about the sewers; what was left of the Greeks did plate.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly than what had happened, if IT happened geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, even for fear that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha pipe restaurants opened, kept in mind and have been depressed with the inaction.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his ability.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because they had heard only ballads, it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words, the Kevern's very front yard had ever could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still do not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father should love something?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence.</seg>
<seg id="59">They already thought that he was a little strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It was fun," he said to him instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing to see in the world, as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say it," they mean no conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But it never explains why you have me vorsingst.</seg>
<seg id="66">They seemed genuinely concerned.</seg>
<seg id="67">My feet are too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He saw yet again.</seg>

<seg id="70">Perhaps your ankle, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And then you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">You hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst," he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That sounded not right.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was supposed to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because, like his father, he does not have the soothing charm that you needed to goad the inherent cruelty in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps his father also wanted to be cruel.</seg>

<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomon's was red and arose from their deck chair, raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elder flowers of wine, drunkenness was no excuse for it.</seg>
<seg id="86">In their excitement, they seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head is precisely the reason why I am perverse feel attracted to you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not at all.</seg>
<seg id="89">They did him tired, both due to unnecessary unfriendliness showed his words as well as the fear in their eyes, as they revolted against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">They thought that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THE what had happened as it had been their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise a hand against a woman, refused to meet them or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">It would have shown a big fist, if not farewells.</seg>
<seg id="96">They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then.</seg>
<seg id="97">Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomon's gave him a sign to go through her body.</seg>
<seg id="99">He arose from the deck chair as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">They also felt bleiern, but the impact of his grief surprised them.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They knew very few.</seg>
<seg id="103">They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man, complained had provoked by something he himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, they thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against it.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned on her, succumbed to his back, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well, if they could not remember a single time, where they had seen something like this before the day before?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, looked Ailinn Solomon's on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">An intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of a number of years before the events, ESME Nussbaum, has just told Ofnow, the non-legislative oversight body for the public mood, in a short lecture on the continued violence in low and middle-level in exactly the areas in which they reduce, if not eliminate, most likely to be expected, given the money and energy that had been invested in the eradication of this violence.</seg>
<seg id="109">"It was a lot done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that has won a thousand wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the towering church towers between the hedges.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties are ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the tower, it seems, the less the passion he still inspires.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population cries while listening sentimental mental ballads enthralled with stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but it is not just the former rawness rural communities, as well as our urban fabric firmly in control, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious dispute is looking at home, at work, on the streets, and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," her mentor when he had read the entire report said.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read a few novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">ESME Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: Are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe that I should not say that," said ESME Nussbaum.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Re-appointed ESME on their right to privacy and denial of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence again.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not," said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of hyper-sensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable, occasionally can distort results, as you have presented to them.</seg>
<seg id="126">They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things that you describe as "disingenuous" and "raw" could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others.</seg>
<seg id="127">If we continue on the riding around, what will happen if, as if it were, if it had happened, happened yesterday, IT IS done is to take the country's essential vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile on their neighbours, you value your partner, you will hear ballads, please visit musicals, use your phone, you, you, you hear, you agree to excuse yourself.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talking is better than silence, the song is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I can absolutely understand what you want," ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice, as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end, "and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that without notice of us, we may find, as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time, but not the other, in which we miss our anger and mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz form a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">To indicate a patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"They go too far," he said, "if you describe the actions as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.</seg>
<seg id="138">They go too far, if you say that they had left their "anger" and their "distrust" of "other".</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we understand the past, such as the protection of the present, not to speak of "us" and "other".</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there was no "others."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, this is what we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"From the, if we are honest with ourselves," dared ESME smash, "no part of the society can claim to have behave well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing has to be said - as we are in agreement.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as no blame must be assigned, no debt must be repaid, if such a repayment would be appropriate and if there were a way to wipe them.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what is the past, if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is designed to ensure that we forget it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz, his pyramid coincide.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will remember her report," he said and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, when she went to work as usual, it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist, who described as passers-by, was driven into a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="2">The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to its lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched survey with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) fell in August to 50,7 in, according to a state of 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A number above 50 indicates an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders went back and factories experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets are expecting a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro area, as well as the threat of deflation from the bank with an inflation rate of just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that, in the course of this week, the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information, whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those of the United Kingdom and the United States were made during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, are the deterrent effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for the manufacturer has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>

<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing manager index of manufacturing in the eurozone in August, is that the sector continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Producers in the eurozone will find life is obviously very difficult, because the current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to Russia and the Ukraine, continue to increase uncertainty in the difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>

<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">Children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, as fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed, it seemed like the böseste of evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="9">We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever.</seg>

<seg id="38">As seven years, he said, "mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion, he thought she would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She said to him: "Run."</seg>
<seg id="41">Full of fear that they could be dead, he fled and saw the baby on the way to a wine, took it by the hand and fled by bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father, Vladimir, into the arms of his son out there, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I could not save them."</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part in the assumption that her son died.</seg>

<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But he has now fear for the ground like Ukraine, where wars cause the sort of accident that he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop reminding me.</seg>

<seg id="63">His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighbourhood were killed, can you imagine that?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who could call and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>

<seg id="68">She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and you say to yourself that 10 years have passed, but I still remind me of her and her husband at the meeting in London, and how it works - and has helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember how happy Damir wanted to eat borscht and she cried all local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. - shot with a water pistol on them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was just a month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British are so willing shared our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world is not improved in the last 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Ukraine, the war now again, and people die every day, and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are precisely such children as ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that, for many, the war is a part of the news that you hear when they are bored or preoccupied with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know what these people feel throughout the horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I cannot stop to feel that.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is looking for example not revenge, he is not overwhelmed by recent abominations.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember but he has six close friends from the class and they go occasionally in the sports hall and light candles.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was small, he suffered including - I remember, as it is sometimes presented on the sofa, the face away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. - is now 17, bigger than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that, for a few hours, I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I recovered after the explosion and came on the legs, I saw me and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying around everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy in the hell could not possibly have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I reminded him," Damir, going, going away, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And, unlike many others, life goes on for us.</seg>

<seg id="96">His blutüberströmtes face was painted by fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a nurse, had sold him for his first day, before they rushed to bring their older son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so was my little boy there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my born managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date approaches, the harder it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would happen yesterday, some scenes from these days are following me constantly.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget that, I assure you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgent: The image of born (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school, he said that he wants to embrace his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there are even this statue of the wine-born in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Born does not like the image, and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.</seg>
<seg id="112">Born today says: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is becoming something awful.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget it just a little.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years, I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went back to school later in 2004 and had fear every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.</seg>
<seg id="125">So I always in the gym when the 1st September approaches.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is difficult for me to go to the gym, but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I don't like bemitleide.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will be heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was an education in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health has not.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgy Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, even though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorists, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="140">It really is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it, as if it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to go as the FSB intelligence officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I have to say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt better after something, but I cannot forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, a year later, was the first and only time I went back in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never do not return and ask me to show you where I have sat in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically, it is good to me.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can now go well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have submitted my papers, including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been there two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should know nothing and they should not suffer it of course.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">He is in my soul, worse if the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations in his memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that born will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even more intense for him, because he was there and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and all of them are drawn in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Born is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to accept that, if a little experience so Unfaires.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he loves sport, but he cannot attend because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horrors to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will always follow us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I have lost a lot of people, which I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the slain.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if it does not want.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now, I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country, and I can hardly believe that.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many more are being killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If only we could all use and throw these rebels - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="190">Saved: Aljona Tskajewa is brought to safety by a Russian special operations command (left).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is now ten (right) and remembers nothing of the atrocities</seg>
<seg id="192">The world was held their breath when the baby Aljona carried in the arms of a Russian policemen from the siege in Beslan in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists thought they could go, but in its cruelty of their 30-year-old mother, Kristina's 10-year-old sister and her brother Makhar back into the school sports hall.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there are a variety of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are to be had for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I have these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump into it, check, up in the depth of your equipment is functional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others by 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search for traditional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and the ratings for digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots, because many will not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat, with which you can compose images, action-cams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right attitude is a matter of chance.</seg>
<seg id="16">So take many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a terraced mode, in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings, use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light will be dramatically worse, the further you remove themselves from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, you remain so close to the surface, if you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Go close to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is also a good advice on land, but it is all the more important because of the poor lighting conditions under water.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is particularly important if you are working with an action-cam: These devices often have a wide-angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to your objects, if they are to fill the entire picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the species, whose character things changed, even in a gigantic organisation such as the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As an advisory anesthetist devoted his career of the task to save the health of both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 staff who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the doctors and the diagnosis of diseases are important, while the Behandelten are mostly preoccupied with something else: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, he was the one, however, the ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties, raise me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he said that he had made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything now rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt a very unusual way and concerned without reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result was the X-ray examination.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, which attacks the lungs of beneficial skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers is often difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">While some smokers to lung disease, for example, are not all lung cancer in smokers.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos contamination - contact with the fiber material, once regarded as the "miracle material" but has now been recognized as fatal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is a disease mesothelioma, which can easily ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous to use was no longer used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to use them any more.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even where he was still used, only people worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers in certain sectors, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial risk material from another time, he seems to be of little concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, seen today is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from the disease than in road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual figures of the Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and expected future deaths in Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are seeing the deadly impact now, although asbestos is illegal for years (1999) were banned all types of asbestos, is that a mesothelioma developed only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, often, still present in the houses, in which we live, the offices in which we work, schools, in which we learn and the shops where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore knows no class barriers mesothelioma, financial limits, jobs or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are no protection.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building, asbestos contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in the hospitals where we should be healthy, have already been identified as source herd of this deadly Karzinogens.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, it could be difficult to imagine where he may have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found out it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years, there was a lot of asbestos," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and guard - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries are suffering from the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">This question he could answer, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital, and the 2010 in the last five years of mesothelioma disease," he wrote in a letter, "I am the last, is still alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us are still fall ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long survival time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within eight months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still fall ill?"</seg>
<seg id="53">Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the epidemic of asbestos in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, a total of 90,000 will be a victim of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="54">At the moment, most of them have no idea that they will die.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the courts, in which people often turn for damages, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, have to be exposed to asbestos, Janice Allen negligent way.</seg>
<seg id="58">They worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years than when they began their work at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">She now has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"In this matter," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I did not even really about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that I would affect the time.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the concept of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure, which makes the fabric resilient and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six have been used in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, today it is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used for roof panels, floor plates, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still seen as a "major health risk" with the possibility of death by the EU and the WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are significant, but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that their story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected will be shown that "a substantial proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or at home was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">In his statement, a large proportion of these contacts is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It seems that no one could expect to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which has investigated the Palace of Westminster, shows how people could also be in the heart of the government, have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 reported Goddard that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres could be taken by something as harmless as "strong air movements.</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of Parliament are often accused to care for their own interests, but here, it looks as to be the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace have received a "clean" health certificate, it is now clear that £1 billion amount must be paid over several years to renovate Parliament to modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that the Members of Parliament after the general election in 2015 will probably make more in nearby QEII Conference Centre in Westminster than on the green benches.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report has also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who could never identify the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott claimed that during his work in hospitals, he was exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked in a hospital, in which asbestos lawsuits were decided in a positive way," he says, "but I cannot prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to recall all places where you worked, and the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he is still clearly remembered the day at the beginning of December 2009, where he got a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and had an operation in late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought the ride home to create no more.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain from the chest fur, the skin around his lungs herrührten.</seg>
<seg id="95">But he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma as Janice Allen.</seg>
<seg id="96">He went to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Verwunderte doctors, x-rays of his chest and put Pleurakathether to be fluid in the lungs and to test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">But his complaints were without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health slowly stabilized, and he returned to his job back.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time the symptoms returned back, however, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, a patient Abbott's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now, Abbott combined this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray images to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, one with a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the Rippen- and the chest fur.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I am usually just move on, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest, I had not done so many concerns.</seg>
<seg id="110">But my wife, Rachel, was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was said to me that it be mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now, he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now become ill.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so is mesothelioma now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were under the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who changed in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens ate Graham Abbott (as it often did), most likely came in contact with the toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It is clear that hospitals for patients over several decades after the war were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">He is still today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students presented their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was due to its fabulous isolating and flame properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Even schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Indeed, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have parked their bunsenburner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites are now often raised the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile, items in our homes as innocent as floor plates or shingle roofs by default contain asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It is an industrial poison that is included in large parts of our properties," said Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who has represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, which invaded a affected woman, was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So beware, as you stop your garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process it," Mr Abbott said.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue to make, but I realized that what I was doing, I could not focus on that.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks ago in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and look after myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will have no further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">The biggest difficulty was the fresh approach from the position of a doctor to a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before he reminds himself, as he overwhelmed by all the information was that he had to come around.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very difficult to absorb all of this," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor" as long as I yet? "</seg>
<seg id="143">And it gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, 'Well, I will have no further Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it then. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism - the breathing itself - that caused the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is being raised and the fibers are inhaled, they can establish themselves in the chest fur, the skin around the lungs,.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can trigger cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," said Professor Tom treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon, moved to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to the asbestos during their training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, says treasure, "they are pushed to the edge of the breathing process where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is inherently invasive from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options work for other cancers in mesothelioma not so good.</seg>
<seg id="157">For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies this.</seg>
<seg id="160">"The breast skin cannot be cut out," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You cannot beat about the bush with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer "on chemotherapy is not very good," the "effect," but not healed.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living in a long time, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Mr Abbott still fighting two and a half years after his diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis had become a one-man-of support and consultancy for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, cancer centre," he is happy on calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Abbott had originally been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and expected to prolong his life just about a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">However, Lawson managed "to let things in a more positive light."</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardio-thoracic specialist at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage because I no longer had to be referred, I just cried and got an appointment," Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would need to receive a payment and have to wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers, to be able to play the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments, inevitably fail, many patients are from a different financial concern about the future of the families they left behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It is known that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health since 1898," Morgan says.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what has changed in the 1960s, we realized that even a small burden posed a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of companies started to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital, in their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" that Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="187">According to a spokesman confirmed the investigation into his death of Guy's, however, that "the asbestos fibres were removed in the 1990s in the basement area affected."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How asbestos can be removed</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, it is a huge problem for mesothelioma sufferers who care about compensation, to trace the deadly asbestos contact a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend itself against claims to know that it is time for them, but certainly not with the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="194">There were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients in this year in response to demand compensation, even if their former employers will no longer be traceable.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has established a fund of £350 million for all funded by the insurance industry, which were diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact, but cannot sue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process could have granted them - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications for the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma patients, thinks that £350 million were a "very good job" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma sufferers find the company and they could sue normally.</seg>
<seg id="200">Mike Penning, then work and pensions minister, admitted that the law is "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan gave that prompt action was necessary in the face of seven deaths a day.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are so much suffering and need help now," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At the time, Mr Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first debate, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This has been accompanied by a radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy, Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, with the most important thing," Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="208">This can be seen in patients again and again.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something you can continue.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you place you are worse very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he was behind the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There have been several cancer spots in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again, Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">No trace of the tumours is now more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.</seg>
<seg id="222">They need to think about practical things - about the money when I am no longer, for example, or my wife, show how the boiler time setting works.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you get bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 14, 16, and Tamsin, this is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is difficult for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I have a disease that I would not be old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted in different ways.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denies Hong Kong law on government election, protesters swear vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese parliament against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections despite the increased calls for democratic reform in Hong Kong's electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach fired probably the long-planned protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists in the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement led the way.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the communist leaders in principle to reject all the candidates are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defence of the Chinese decision said Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the admission of public nominations in the elections for Hong Kong's government to "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain returned control of the Chinese Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to let the people choose the government leaders from 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct suffrage to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the process by a nomination committee closely controlled by Beijing firmly in hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a new clause should be allowed in only candidates "with love the country and love for Hong Kong."</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests took place in Hong Kong for several years.</seg>
<seg id="14">The movement is behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to insulate the financial district if Beijing does not allow a genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement have reached a new level of civil disobedience, and they planned protest waves in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They gave no details, however, apparently in order to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online communication has told the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the central district considered only as a last resort, an action that is expected to take place only if all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted, and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry to say that today have been exhausted all dialogue opportunities and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared themselves for days at the announcement of Beijing, and there were more stringent security measures, including police and barricades in front of the government building on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest will be strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, they slowly lose control of their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland reinforces the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong -.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, which they say, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said legal expert regime Ip, who criticised the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to stir up fears that Hong Kong spirals out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-controlled media also reported recently on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights activists, in which 780,000 people participated in this summer - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="9">Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands of the students in 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with -Start is just that.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize racial issue and police behavior after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon at the beginning of this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "hands up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown said the blogger Miriam Zoila Perez a change in online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminist commentators raise the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">During the tensions in the Midwest, however, rose and received attention throughout the country, saw Perez, the responses of white women turned up to 100% of the breed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women came shortly after the shots from 9 August the personal essays with titles like "thoughts to Ferguson of a white woman" and "feminism is not only about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez meant that an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not believe that one in feminism is many people talk about the white and privileges on so-type," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt urged to express something about the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and ethnicized because the situation in Ferguson is that they need to express it.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson problems to light that black Americans are exposed to every day, but they should not be seen as a "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can publish something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something on how black people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public space?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues clean; they live in the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story, in order to justify the Lynch murder.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery came the divide between white and black women at the point at which white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and said that the fight for the right to vote only for one group could be successful: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for blacks should come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you are reminded of such things, one with power will understand why coloured women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done our job well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade until white women against the Lynchen organised in the Association of Southern woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was founded nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time, in which white feminists "trapping" played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It would be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to a child's education as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second-generation feminists, who built her career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, distribution of the Guardian, in which they demanded more protests of white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a separate but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race, which are very different in public opinion polls - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem intersectional feminism stands for a more interactive section, in which race and gender issues are some of their comments on the racial issue in America but puzzled.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole feminism?" Said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems to Ferguson's comments are in contrast to its previous criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently a small program, My Brother's keeper, celebratory, in order to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were infuriating reactions of many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The relationship between the police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of the mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police has taken nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country's southwest border this year, is also the subject of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that women mobilised for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as a fundamental issue of women, they only had to publish the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of work visas is going to male immigrants, the women who accompany them, are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find an echo in the women's organisations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not only the gladiators were ankle deep in the mud at the first Rhine Bacher Römertag in the park.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1000 visitors yesterday, braving the rain showers and the autumn cold and enchanted by the historical spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a colorful series of images, shows, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance in the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the Mart IALI Che fighter force of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis" who used any rain break in the arena crafted with soft sand to demonstrate their robust martial art.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Leonidas" gladiatorial owner proved to be humorous and knowledgeable Präsentator and sent one of his men in the ring for the heroic battle in various gladiators genera.</seg>
<seg id="7">First were the "Provocatoren" in line with rectangular shield and sword briefly on the right arm and leg rail on the left leg and Armschiene.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and litter lance and iron gladiator helmet, leg and Armguard.</seg>
<seg id="9">Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius," with the ball against the network, three Zack and dagger "Secutor" and recently joined the boys fight to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since crashed the metallic together swords, shields schepperten and throwing lances surrend flew through the arena that could be a fear and worry about the health of the gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="11">But to the impressive "Summa Rudi," the muscular referee, had a close eye.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and the culture of Roman times," Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the Company "Freundeskreis Roman channel," explained the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation time was a "Roman Oppidum from the park for a day," a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage said in his address.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings, which we still see today.</seg>
<seg id="15">The remains of these were also the Römertag to visit a "aqueduct marble" from 11 meters high and the 1400-metre-long Romans channel bridge stood at Lüftelberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Frontinus society, water and energy to then and now, and director Petra Fricke knew: "We are still benefit from the knowledge of that time."</seg>
<seg id="17">It also confirms a surveyor Ralph Holy presented two "from Rheinbach, surveying instruments of the Romans like Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra from" engineering team.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Roman villa in naked home, sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 and bricks from the original Hypokauste, a hot-air heating, which was once the Roman villa warmer.</seg>
<seg id="19">Impressive as the footprints, which had been left by Wolf and Fox in the foot steps from clay two millennia ago, before it burned.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2011, the Office for soil conservation at the Rhineland National Association had unearthed the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park in North Rhine river.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have found a commercial building with a Darre for drying of grain boundary walls and the Mälzen.</seg>
<seg id="22">The building was probably belongs to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, the archaeologist explained Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of findings from these excavations put it in a glass case before, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a dainty necklace.</seg>

<seg id="8">More than half of the District, 56%, revenue comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Mary's revenues come from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses, with 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large part of the increase in the tax revenue is due to a recovery of corporate real estate values, the researchers say, which led to an increase in property taxes at 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits came from big states like California, New York and Texas, the process seems appropriate for the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Happens in Maryland is the following: A large part of the real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporate revenues also seem to recover, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Businesses in the region reported income taxes in state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses is not evenly in all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue from 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three with 6 percent in all three areas, there are strong business rates).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study at the beginning of this year, the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The district was not examined in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages, Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the government continues to achieve its revenue targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems to be the small businesses in the Washington area, and they are therefore more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes, which are paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a transitional structure, organized by the most businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion in the past year, a clear faster growth rate than the corporate taxes as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year, with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region, the Washington area could lag behind.</seg>

<seg id="6">"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week visiting an SPD delegation in his city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Again and again, the official of China's ruling Communist Party in the course of the conversation came back to this concern of the Twelve-million metropolis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed that information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US $970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement is surprising, not because no one had expected a Twitch takeover, but because it was widely believed that YouTube would buy the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google's video service for a cool billion. The cooperation also appeared, of course.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, which was founded as see only three years ago, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead it has quickly become a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, "YouTube for live games," said an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a video genre, in the opinion of the (mostly older) games give a veneer of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is precisely that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube did not do so, because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer, President of this statement: "We have decided on Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport, it is difficult to understand the attraction, the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">You could see all these games right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today, so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the quick passes, all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as it is not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do skeptics like I already know of them?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic spikes.</seg>
<seg id="21">And exactly how Amazon wants to make money from it?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video, such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something that each company would like: Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of Twitch, sheer, said that Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the medium is showing no signs of contraction, yet not even - gulp - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the bouncy castle on the castle garden festival was something on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organisers agreed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the strong Regengusses on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">At times the admission had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was annoying," said Ron SEM, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salt Wedel light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">For two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron SEM have formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the Open Air in Salzwedeler castle garden, brightness is broadcast on the day and in the evening by various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and the fun is by itself anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was already early Saturday, when the first visitors to the Open Air respect encouragement.</seg>
<seg id="11">A feast for all generations promised the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded in this.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply stands on the castle garden meadow had made it Salzwedeler, but also guests from the hotel and more comfortable surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's the first live performances, wippten enjoyed with the foot to the beat of cool drinks - in short, relaxation and pleasure were the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="15">And across the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While a on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten, others raged at a quarter of wine in the vinotheque frequently, the next generation on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the children's face painting the volunteers had to do with their hands in the truest sense of the word, in order to bring the crowds Mr and imaginative creations in the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Wider took the kicker tables or participating in a skateboard-workshop, the good foot-crew from salt Wedel ausrichtete.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the heavy rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 5.30 p.m. prasselte it down to the visitors, especially families sought the vastness and dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the attractiveness of the feast, it did no harm.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were more people than expected," said Ron SEM, spoke of a "success on the line."</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a repeat of the major party in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although still needs to be worked on the content and the size of the event, Shem made clear in a first assessment on Sunday against the voice of the people.</seg>
<seg id="25">He described as annoying that had to be stopped at the entrance.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little power.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result: Some people who had already paid, were no longer on the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response has been very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate said the Salzwedeler co-organizer of about 1,200 visitors, which is in the castle garden once thronged.</seg>
<seg id="30">There have been problems with the sound.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler hip-hop band blocks' n 'Rox broke their appearance so unnerved.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not in a position to create a fairly reasonable sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned shisha lounges could not be built because the tents because of a puncture could not be brought to salt fronds.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Next year it will be there," says the organiser.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of Amula-Open-Air was more of the visitor numbers as successful.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organisers have some mistakes, which will be forgiven for the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">The organizers also have criticism in the social network Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for 12 euros, you simply expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Unfortunately, ye assumed a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others see the initial problems not quite so closely.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is very good that some chat not only stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.</seg>

<seg id="1">The castle clubs will soon be back in the same direction?</seg>
<seg id="2">Finally, there were always unite dispute between the two Wolf Council Hauser castle.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf Council Hauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, a former chairman of the Council of the Wolf Hauser castle friends, having the project in France.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, there was no good climate between the club and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">So far, the positions, as Hauser Castle and a possible reconstruction should be dealt with the history of the Wolf Council seemed very different.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two sides move to each other, it will soon be held talks on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">Confirm that the club stands Torsten Invest (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (and friends) on demand of our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down together again," Invest reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">So there are visible results more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle suddenly friends with the late Richard Dimbath until recently had an eye on a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forests, the "development and Erlebbarmachung" for the club to Invest is at the forefront of the terrain.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second president of the castle friends, has become very pleased about the call by its own account.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death, it is the castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="16">The club is currently around 40 members, according to the 74-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have the club activities out of respect for the death of my friend Richard Dimbath first leave." This "thinking period" would have been necessary in order "to consider how it could continue."</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the club.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the meantime, the castle friends could also make a current mood within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">A candidate for the presidency, there is not yet says Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that someone will find." He himself will not stand because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a wolf council houses.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Toelzer wants to continue to contribute to the project "but very happy."</seg>
<seg id="24">The different views in terms of reconstruction in the eyes Piffls would remain in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">He appreciates Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipe dream.</seg>
<seg id="27">By a large part of the population, as well as volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.</seg>
<seg id="29">But over time, I am more and more to the conclusion that it is sensible to press ahead with the project. "We could create a" unique selling point "for the raftsmen city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here, there is nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the project by EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors would be affordable, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction will jettison I personally is not easy." He hope that the club at this point might make a difference.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal, first to document the history, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clever ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">As the cost of college textbooks for many students are more than $1,000 per year, is considered a clever austerity idea of fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a temporary system for books by students of higher semester and offered a nominal compensation to delay the sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who visited the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year for textbooks and study materials that there were options for the students but different costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much lower price than at the time of purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books was hired last spring semester in college bookstores, Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer said.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks are purchased, according to the trade group National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the ABC for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are to have the campus bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" VNO Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased at the specialized Chegg.com textbook retailer for 239,99 $.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy used</seg>
<seg id="18">If one of the notes or normal usage tracks represent nothing, used books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is needed in Chegg.com for 93,49 $.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, a student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second edition of "Strategic Media decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was recently sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students and their professors ask whether earlier editions are acceptable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, elderly spending can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Chegg and Amazon is also a popular alternative for used books helped EverestPoker.com of eBay Inc.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rents</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting textbooks is worthy of consideration, if you treat them fairly well, remember, back to you and you do not want to keep the books at the end of the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a new book purchases.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student might rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Learn more about the terms of the transaction in which you rent, including on the criminal charges, the case for the writing of notes, underscores or use traces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tenants beware: If you don't return the book, the criminal charges may even exceed the price of a new book.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why was no blockbuster "Guardians of the Galaxy"</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of its budget of $90 million in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only $12 million of its budget of $70 million album.</seg>
<seg id="3">The film "Sex tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz played only $14.6 million on opening weekend, while children's films such as "tame dragons made easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves in children's films could be the reason.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin described as "the worst year" in 2014 so far for children's films and described "dragon tame made easy 2" as a "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">In films for a slightly older audience, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta critic rating for every summer film start between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and was shown in the current year to at least 2000 canvases.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critic and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of last year.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg's film studios to ensure that they are very focused on Harry Potter of comics and predicted a "meltdown" in Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that its grim prophecy could contain a real core.</seg>
<seg id="15">Due to the potential blockbuster expected in the summer of 2015, including Aven Gers: The Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, however, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of cash results as simply "cyclical" and said to the Hollywood reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer at the cinema office at all, and no one is more concerned about the business."</seg>

<seg id="2">With the 2-0 on Grödig a bitter week for Rapid has taken a hoping end on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached a low with the death in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed captain and Müller Steffen Hofmann, who came in third place with green and white.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel Traumtor brings Rapid on winning street Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment with the second season victory against Helsinki and comes with a success in the countries game break.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive response," said foreign defender Thomas Schrammel, with its splendid leadership-volley from Sechzehnereck has asked the course to victory in the 14th minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought, I Hau all the frustration of Thursday purely and schnalzte it under the bar," said the 26-year-old smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">The last time Schrammel on 13 Novmember 2010 so far had taken in a league game, it was still in Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first championship match in Rapid-dress will therefore remain in special memory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is something special for me, I am from the Rapid-kids," said Schrammel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short-term pelvic-Blessur of Mario Pavelic became Schrammel from the left to the right defensive side and also did very well in his cause.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has enough experience, that he can put this position also reversed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The gate has earned it, he has done some assists this year already, "praised Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character Schrammel delivered Hofmann's flank for 2-0 after an hour, that finally brought the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because before that could well can also contact the guests.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we have had a bit of luck today," said Schrammel, alluded to the divergence of performance and result in recent weeks: "The results have not voted, but the playful was always good compared to last year."</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic was, in fact, that it was "in many games before better than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium."</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character."</seg>
<seg id="19">Equally pleasing for him: "That we finally have played back to zero."</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of work while countries break Even the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni alar and Michael Schimpelsberger mourning several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp pushed be citizens gave their Startelfdebüts makes the victory even more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We must not forget that," warned Barisic, which lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which were very stable in recent times."</seg>
<seg id="22">The countries break should therefore be used to "lick wounds and purchase a bit in physical terms," said Barisic, which has five U21 squad players in its ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">The break is particularly suits, one is Captain Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="24">He breaks for the team, goes beyond pain over it.</seg>
<seg id="25">In this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us, "noted Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann gave the Rapids game before his replacement in the 68 minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year-olds, who completed his 350. Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4: 2 on the eigentlich).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "Cannot believe that everything now is good," "We have certainly had a bit of luck, but eventually the happiness must come back to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="30">He warned, however, remain to be concentrated: "You should not always black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the last few weeks we have not played as badly as it has been presented.</seg>
<seg id="32">But we must not think that all is well.</seg>
<seg id="33">He did not deny the importance of his role for the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">To keep themselves in certain phases, but to me, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig-coach Michael Baur himself and his team had few complaints.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the fast against hits "from the category Zaubertor," as well as the regular gate of the farm in the 40th minute by referee Kollegger had been wrongly denied.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not specific enough towards the gate at some stages.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we have had too few qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="40">Inside defender Maximilian Karner looked like it: "It is a bad start, but we have only found and even made a gate.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the whole, it would have been better.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin calls for the inclusion of "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine from Kiev</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin told Russian media reported on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made clear later that Putin will not have meant that the area under the control of separatists in eastern Ukraine is a part of Russia, but that his status should be redefined to Ukraine, in order to give the power to represent the rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's call to the Kiev government suits negotiations on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents but to the strategy pursued by him since the beginning of the riots five months apparently: Support for the separatists in the adoption of areas and put pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novo Rossija region de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state television station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture areas held by the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently adopted this area as "Novo Rossija" or "New Russia," a term that recalls the vorrevolutionäre heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin and Ukrainian politicians pointed out that all those during the campaign for the elections on 26 Oct. while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope for early peace talks "trapped in their illusions," Itar-TASS reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, in order to protect the interests of the people who live there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood should be seen in the context of the greater autonomy, which will be discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, in order to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern areas, Peskow said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow could have been far more difficult to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are no Russians and polls arose from the time before a broad majority for the whereabouts of the conflict in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, the regional governments in Ukraine would give authority to negotiate trade agreements and external relations of their own, and thus give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that combines the Russian territory with the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The five months ago annexed peninsula in the Black Sea is the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech to the inauguration on June 7 that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider amendments to the Constitution, the respective areas will be given greater control over its finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which is accused of arming and incitement of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by a further encroachment of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated through the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-supported separatists took over the coup, according to Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fix Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and narrow access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked an urgent need for action to prevent a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which is independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are just at the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the lead the draft demanded further sanctions against Russia, which will come into force in a unspezifizierten escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke last week in the Donetsk region, in order to support the besieged separatists, said Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Repo on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who were captured in a week on Ukrainian territory, said Lysenko on Sunday.</seg>
