Ebola: The epidemic charged West African economic
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are deserted - and international enterprises are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic dealt a heavy blow to the economy of West Africa.
The crop rotted in the fields, the mines are abandoned and orphaned the markets - the virus has added to the region difficult.
Some international companies already go on distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic", says the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes in the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Comes only on the market who food or want to buy something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone, more than 600 people fell the fever.
Recently, the health authorities declared the disease had penetrated every corner of the country.
The virus has spread also in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, and thousands more contracted.
Foreign companies pull out staff
Everywhere in resource-rich countries, companies suspend their operation.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
Also the local merchants and farmers respond: only a few merchants leave their hometowns, yet to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, who are under quarantine, including you for exporting important cocoa and coffee beans in the fields to rot.
Farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food will be scarce
"People are traveling less and less", Paris expert on the economy of West Africa says Philippe de Vreyer.
For example, the man who normally goes on the market and sold his vegetables, remains better at home.
The population is therefore the consequences of the epidemic direct and urgent to feeling: foods are scarce.
On the markets, the supply of staple foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time an image - threat of damage to the strongly international company-dependent region with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger was that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank IRIS.
Crucial is how far and how long will the virus still spread.
Investors could create the impression "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, and thus also to invest", warns Hugon.
The disease burden also strained national budgets of the States
The disease burden already strained national budgets of the States concerned.
The Moody's rating agency, it feared that whose budgets are severely strained by the high costs for the health system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
Already, the African Development Bank promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are felt even in Nigeria, where so far few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
Although the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta is so far unaffected.
But many people out of fear of contagion elsewhere already at home.
Reservations in hotels go back significantly.
