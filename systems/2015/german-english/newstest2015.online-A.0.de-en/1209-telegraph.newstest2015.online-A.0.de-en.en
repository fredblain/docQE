Garden centres regret declining numbers of homeowners
The decline along with a reinforced fall in the number of homeowners under 35 years of age could cause that garden centers lose tens of thousands of pounds per year, when today's young consumers reach the "core age group for garden products" according to a study of the HTA, as reported in the financial times.
The report states that tenants on average spend 55% of their value, spend the people with homes for their garden.
The increase of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedures to pave front yards for parking purposes and other factors that threaten the sector, are decreasing garden size of 5 billion estimated Â£ implemented annually in sales.
In greater London, where over a period of 6 years, the percentage of homeowners from 61 to 43 percent has fallen, the least expenditure for garden products per household are reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society indicate that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people can grow any plants.
Guy Barter, Chief garden Adviser for the RHS said: "container gardening is very popular, for example, with tenants, because you can take your plants during a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of the garden retail due to increasing numbers of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s.
He predicted for this year also an improved market situation due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
