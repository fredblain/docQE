There is a rest under this tree
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of the Rhöner happiness" last Friday.
There are several of these giant of trees in the district, the pictured specimen is the "Geißruheiche" above by Unterbrunn white.
A bumpy walk leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak.
It misses on coupling, pile of basalt stone and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry from the Bauer mountain, one kilometre north of the road to Weisbach, there it is.
Vital is the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of nearby and reminiscent of an American giant Sequoia with a circumference of about eight metres.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and interviewed older people from white Unterbrunn to learn which circumstances did it with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his investigations was the rather sober explanation for the name.
Therefore, the goat herders should have driven until about 80 years ago their animals under Weißenbrunn from the laboriously cleared and freed from stones meadows.
At the foot of the tree the animal keeper, exhausted from the ascent should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, herds of goats graze actually.
The area has been declared in addition to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, has further found Schneider.
Upon entering the stone collections should be careful, but, because the basalt warmed up by the Sun is a popular place to stay for Adders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterbrunn whites to the tree, but somewhat hidden.
Other routes are signposted that climb towards Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the water Castle?
A water Castle is looking for our next task, but is in the height rarely found.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings, including the building picture could fit in the district.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner happiness"?
