The tradition of the school prom in the United States is now transferred to the universities, where freshmen are offered performances by the private company.
We are pleased to be able to respond to this demand and the UK's first luxury travel service for students today to offer.
To achieve a very impressive appearance at the University, the company offers also transport options such as private jets, Rolls Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Also, Mr. Stewart stated that the service has a Security Division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise drive, huh their belongings in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options we forward, to ensure that the students achieve the University with a minimum of fuss and a maximum of luxury this year.
A company spokesman said, yet no new bookings to exist since the service was introduced recently, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks".
The company also announced that despite the tuition fees of Â£9,000 per year expect a market for this offer.
Students today differ in their expectations and demands from the students from 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - is more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and with VIF can exactly.
The National Student Union criticized the service however as out of touch.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the NUS for higher education said: "this offer seems entirely separate from the lives of the majority of the students.
Many students who start studying this month, face a crisis of cost of living, because the available financial assistance in the form of loans and grants with the soaring bills keep for the simplest basics of life before she can even think to spend thousands of pounds for something so simple as the arrival in the dorm.
