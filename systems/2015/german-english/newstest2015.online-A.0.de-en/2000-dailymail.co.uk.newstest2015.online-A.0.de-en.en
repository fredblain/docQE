The hell Decade of Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of school as still suffer the children is entangled.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan in southern Russia as hostages.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, have been in the three-day ordeal, that shocked the world, killed.
We have returned to Beslan, some finding the victim who escaped death when the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan in which 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new Apocalypse in the Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists children and parents took captive the beginning of a new school year, September 1, 2004, and killed, seemed like the most evil of evil.
The tragedy brought together East and West in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.
Ten years later we returned to Beslan, some finding the victim who escaped death when the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell forever will follow.
Their best hope?
That the war, which now haunts the Ukraine - and where children die as they - now comes to an end.
The girl who was photographed attempting in the shattered brick school gym back to climb
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she tried only in their underwear, in the shattered brick school gym back to climb after a mine exploded.
Totally confused AIDA was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were held for dead, but she survived.
"A woman told me I should run for my life, but I could not," Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed into it again to find my mother.
A soldier took her to safety.
Thought she was healed up completely after a series of operations, but yesterday said: "three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid that I must be operated on again.
Some shrapnel are still in my knee.
Its aim is now, was to be helped to help people, such as her doctors dentist.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it has not destroyed me," she says combative.
"This happened to me, and you can't change that.
I'm always in the gym, that to remind me, that there were once in a year.
My friends and I try to talk to other days not.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were kids and dreamed to go to the school together.
"I don't want to marry, until I finish my studies and start my career.
I am thinking of a family later.
She says that the siege will remain always a part of it, although the memory every year is something weak.
I'm glad that many people in the world still remember to our horror and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and around the world.
When I see the photo of me online, I think how I return climb in the school, that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and to contribute that to not happen again.
The boy, who fled through the hail of bullets, hoping that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven, he said: "Mama told me I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him: "Run."
Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who closed his son out into the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save her."
In reality was out there tripped Tamara after and with leg injuries in the hospital, for its part in the assumption that her son had been killed.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now defunct newspaper news of the world), to the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie the title of a Barnardo children it champion to receive.
"This horror tracks you everyday, but I wish I could stop with the recall," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it will pale in my memory.
I still know that I threw away all my toy guns immediately afterwards.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.
"I'm not scared, to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I played in the yard, and that it not out there have done.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they have been in the Sports Hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could choose about what I wanted, and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he's afraid to spot such as the Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.
"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me next year at the Training Academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call in and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London were crying when I told our story.
At that time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
She was grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 Cherie Blair and her Foundation.
I wish I could call Cherie and you yourself say that 10 years have passed, but I still at the meeting her and her husband in London remember me, and how the Damir and me has helped.
I still remember how Damir wanted to like to eat Borscht and they called all local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water gun at them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.
In the Ukraine, the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I think that many children have been and still are killed.
These are just such children like ours.
I think that for many the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I know what these people feel the whole horror.
And I can not stop to feel that.
Nothing has changed, the people want to kill each other always and that is so sad.
Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
For example he does not search for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.
I know that he remembers not like it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was small, he suffered - I remember, how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is greater than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy now 17.
I can hardly believe that I for a few hours so was sure that he was dead and I would see him again.
I myself recovering after the explosion and came on the legs, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with all surrounding parts of the body.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could possibly have survived.
"I remember, I cried to him,"Damir, run, run", but I was so sure that he had not heard me.
But he has heard it, and he ran away.
And so life goes differently than that of many others, for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy, whose terrible screen became a symbol of the horrors of Beslan after the siege
Consolation: The Beslan survivors Georgij Lyin with his mother, Fatima after the siege of 2004, on the right a picture of George today
His blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear, as he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had him for his first day of school dropped off, before she go hurried to bring their elder son Vladimir to the University.
"I left the Court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there terrible days alone, for three," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my George managed to survive.
This date approaches, the harder it is, to think and talk about.
There is no single date at which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think that it is a long time ago, I mean, it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days chasing me all the time.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Urgently: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been as immortalized statue (right).
I remember that George wanted to like go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.
And now there's even this statue of George weeping in San Marino.
George doesn't like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the Bookshelf with us at home.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world thanks to this picture feel our pain.
George says today: "it is important that as something never can happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in the Ukraine.
Will we ever know what has caused it?
This world is something terrible.
"I can understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so what happens?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to it's a small little forgetting.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
About three or four years I had a few nightmares due to the siege, but then it was better.
I returned to school later in the year 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.
Therefore, I'm always in the gym, when closer to the 1 September.
I should say my old childhood friends tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel victimized, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I don't feel sorry for me.
My life goes on.
I've completed this year of the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I'll be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not permit that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It truly is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel it, as if it were yesterday," says George, who as intelligence officer to the FSB wanted to go, but could not do this because of his health problems due to the siege.
It is still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt then actually slightly better, but I can't it not forget."
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only time, I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never again go back and not ask me please to show you where I have been sitting in this famous image.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I think don't like it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.
Physically I'm fine.
I should be careful about my injured knee, but I can run right now.
But due to my health I could not study at the secret service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg, how I wanted to.
I've submitted my documents, the medical and she responded that it was not possible.
The animals were my second passion, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.
I have already two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats up to cows".
He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences.
Children should know anything about that, and they should not suffer of course also it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "this sorrow leave me never.
It is worse in my soul, if closer to the anniversary.
I will go to the celebrations commemorating.
I know that George will not go down.
It must be heavy still much for him, because he was there and I didn't.
I was at home waiting on him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful that he returned me God. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It remains in us.
George is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.
It is hard to accept that something so unfair happens to one.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can not take part due to his knee.
He was operated on several times, he can run, but not sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forgotten.
This horrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and that reinforced only my pain.
I've lost many people that I know well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.
I know born of families, in which new children, but also of widows who have never remarried.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if they don't want that.
I will never forget how my heart in me jumped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see, what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What fight these people?
Why they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I almost can't believe it.
We were a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in the Ukraine, many children have been killed and many are killed.
If we all could - access these rebels and throw out as far away as possible.
