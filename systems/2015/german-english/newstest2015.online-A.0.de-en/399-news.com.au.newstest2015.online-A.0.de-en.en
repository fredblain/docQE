Often misdiagnosed genetic disorder
A British woman says she thought as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost their entire youth in the belief that she have to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with other diseases.
She actually suffered the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK announced that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT, because so little is known about this disease is known.
Probably about 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscular weakness, an unsteady gait and curved toes.
Ill also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms over time are worse.
When Rodgers 13 was, she believed that she was suffering from Friedreich's Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would be 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "as a child I knew that I could do the same as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer for me.
I could never ride with the other kids roller skates or skateboard and was often teased at school because my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that she saw a their medical records at the age of 13 years after several operations to the relief of Achilles tendon and stretch their legs, as her doctor had left the room and read, that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty, because I was curious, so I never told anyone, but I went home and was looking for the disease in the library, wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I got a reply, I was shocked and terribly by panicked.
I thought that I with 18 in a wheelchair would be 25 die and lose slowly all my skills in between would.
I was all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17, she realized that their skills not so much had taken off, as she had imagined it and questioned their doctor.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "my dear, I don't think you have, or you wouldn't be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing was diagnosed with her CMT.
"When he told me what was CMT, I felt as if I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-awareness-month, to draw attention to this disease.
