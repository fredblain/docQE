Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was not a box-office hit
"The expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to kill for" grossed only $12 million in its budget of $70 million.
The film tailored to Cameron Diaz "sex tape" grossed only $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while disappoint children's films such as "train your Dragon 2 made easy" also in revenue.
An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that, when the children's films, the lack of quality of the movies themselves could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films, and described "train your Dragon 2 made easy" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
Films for a slightly older audience, it seems so, as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, entertainment weekly compared the average cinema score and Metacritic rating for any summer film release which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year to at least 2000 screens.
The results are based on the opinions of movie-goers and film critic and indicate that the year's blockbuster are equivalent to those of last year.
Some commentators think that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's Jungle Book soon to be released film, told the Web site Hollywood Reporter: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept that and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak box office results of the Hollywood productions Netflix achieved sales recently with the streaming content in the amount of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
Last summer, criticized Director Steven Spielberg, the movie studios that they concentrated too much on film adaptations of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.
Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could certainly contain a true nucleus.
Because of the expected the summer 2015 potential box-office hit, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, minions and Jurassic World but more optimistic are other representatives of the film industry:
The producer of X-men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in box office results recently as simple "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "the next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and nobody will see it more to the business concerns."
