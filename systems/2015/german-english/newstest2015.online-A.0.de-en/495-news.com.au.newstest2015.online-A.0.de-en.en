Amazon buys twitch for 1.04 billion $
AMAZON has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning: online retailers - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected a takeover by twitch, but because it has been widely suggested that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked as the sale of twitch to the video service from Google for a cool billion done deal, and the cooperation appeared too of course.
Twitch, founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was started as a common streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces in games published a "YouTube for live games", as an insider.
The twitch interface.
And "let it play", a genre of video in the know-it-all to a painting by secret science Theatre the (mostly older) games are already popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube often called somewhat bored, if one wants to describe twitch, so the news that YouTube twitch wanted to buy, was recorded, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube came because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know at the moment about it, is this statement by Emmet shear, President of twitch: "We have for Amazon decided, because they believe in our community, they share our values and our long-term visions and they want to help us to get there faster."
Another secret to the incredible success of twitch is, frankly.
For snobs like me, explaining that they prefer sports as watching, it is hard to understand the attraction that goes to watch others playing rather than take even the control console in the hand.
It is one thing to watch a friend while she sneaks through resident evil, and something else, is shot at 3 in the morning over the shoulder to watch a spinner it like 20 times consecutively in the call of duty in the head.
You could see all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the watch without their own control over the perspective of views can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick passes to the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as it is not a game - or humor virtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.
But skeptics like I already know what?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly will Amazon make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant video as YouTube twitch would have to swallow easily.
But twitch has what any company would like: thousands of young men who are being wooed as advertisers.
As the Chairman of twitch, shear, said Amazon and twitch "believe both on the future of gaming", and the media doesn't even - shows no signs of shrinking, swallow - as a spectator sport.
