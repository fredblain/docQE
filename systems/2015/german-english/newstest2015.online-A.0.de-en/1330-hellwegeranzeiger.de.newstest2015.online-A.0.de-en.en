said the District Chairman of the Union of German Lokomotivführer (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf, Germany.
We expect substantial failures.
There is no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning was the freight.
Deutsche Bahn in North Rhine-Westphalia announced to do everything possible to minimize the impact.
The GDL is that it didn't say where she wanted to strike so that it's hard to specifically predict the consequences.
