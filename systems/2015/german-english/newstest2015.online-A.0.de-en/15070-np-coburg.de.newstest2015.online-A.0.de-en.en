In a statement to the new press, he contradicts statements of CEO Peer Medau and attested this to pose "like a warrior".
The style of the College, wasn't this it says the communication.
So was the family Medau already "oral mid-June about the notion of higher education been informed.
"The statement that the plans were only known in July, are definitely wrong, so PA.
At the same time he pointed out that it is not in the plans to "prior commitments or even decisions", but there "Preferences".
Also required for the access improving the narrow road up to the castle was less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine-metre-wide road was and is out of the question.
Is current state about 5.50 meters, which is a metre wider than ever before", says PA.
The argument of the Medau operators that used their free and own school parking areas in the future only by students at the University, want to leave do not apply PA.
Parked to will not ever, because that how to solve now intelligently with other public parking can be.
Think of the residents
The nursery mountain IMP, which is located on the site and on their doorstep, the access road would lead to the parking deck along, should according to the College President "not be affected".
But he admits, "that involves not just the nursery, but also to the residents at the junction to the Friedrichstraße Streib and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
It therefore involves much more than special interests of Lords Medau", so PA.
The readers whether the criticism of the parents Advisory Board of the crèche, with the expansion of the road would was entitled a "of the few natural spots Coburg lost", "can decide for themselves".
Early October will PA together with the State Building Authority Bamberg 2020 inform the city councils on the development of College "and addressed the importance of the new development in this context".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of nursery of the plans of the University last week.
Therefore, the access for the new parking deck not as so far about the campus and the Friedrichstraße Streib, but about the Medau mountain should lead.
Thus the narrow road on about one km should be expanded length two-lane.
According to projections the Medaus, the traffic in the Park of Schloss Hohenfels thus would increase tenfold.
The speech is of approximately 2000 vehicles a day.
Pages of the city you wanted to not be expressed so far to the project.
