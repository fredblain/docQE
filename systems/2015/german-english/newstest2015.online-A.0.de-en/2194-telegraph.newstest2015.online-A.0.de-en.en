Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose Charakter changed things, even in a so gigantic organization like the NHS.
As consultant physician of the anesthesia he dedicated his career, to save both the agony of the disease and also the torment of treating the sick.
Among his patients, his wife, recalls was a MI6 employee who had to live with the ravages of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important doctors, while the treated are mostly busy with something quite other: pain.
One day in the year 2007 he was the one, whose ordeal began however.
"I've not felt," he wrote in May of this year.
I had difficulties to pick me up.
While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he eagerly reproached his wife Juliet.
"I want it all better now than later", he noted.
Was as Juliet for a week on a business trip, felt quite unusually Lawson and worried for no reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make an X-ray of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he had been in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray existed.
He suffered from Mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which attacks the pleura, so the skin pulled over the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually hard to determine.
While, for example, some smokers will develop lung cancer, not all Lungenkrebserkrankten of former smokers have been.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber materials, which once was considered as "Miracle material" but now was considered fatal.
Mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore how easy for most of us.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos no longer used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry committed voluntarily to stop using it.
Even in places where it was still used, only people in certain industries directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example worked.
As an industrial hazardous material from another time, he seems to be today hardly any cause for concern.
But that complacency is misplaced.
United Kingdom, it seems, experienced today the culmination of an Mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more deaths from Mesothelioma here than in any other country of the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of the disease than in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we now experience the deadly impact, although asbestos is illegal (1999, all types of asbestos have been banned) for years, is that a Mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of the mesothelioma is limited not on former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and often still is in the houses present in which we live, offices, where we work, the schools where we learn and shops, where we buy a.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions, or age.
The privileged bastions, the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter.
The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.
Also in hospitals, where we are still healthy, have been made as a source herd of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also a plumber.
It was difficult in fact him, to imagine where he could have come with asbestos in contact.
Then he found it.
"It looks as if in the tunnels to the guy it a lot of asbestos of hospital, where I completed my education for six years, was present." he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and Porter - use the tunnel.
One wonders how many will suffer my peers the same illness?
Unfortunately at least partially, he could answer this question.
"Of the four doctors, hospital have been trained on the guy, and who became ill in the last five years on mesothelioma", 2010, he wrote in a letter, "am I the last one which is still alive."
How many of us are still developing?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma in the age of 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.
The disease ends always fatal.
We can repeat only Lawson's question: "how many of us will still get sick?"
The leading expert of Britain to mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and by 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, total 90,000 are have fallen victim of the disease.
Most of them have have no idea that they are going to die so at the moment.

A quick look at the files of the dishes to those affected often have recourse due to claims for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year marks & Spencer admitted, for example, have exposed Janice of all negligent erweise asbestos.
She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible of the clothing Department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Their activity with M was only 18 years, as it & S began.
Now, she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I never heard of mesothelioma, I still don't even really knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought that that would even affect me.
There are only few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure, which makes the material strong and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as the white asbestos is the by far most often today found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, is considered "great risk" with possible resulting in death but nevertheless by the EU and the WHO.
However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) is dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "significant, but indirect evidence there, that this was a main reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten."

Janice has not considered himself perhaps all typical Mesotheliomopfer, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows, that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure probably was caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment."
His statement after a majority of these contacts is based on "normal use of aging" our building.
It looks like no one could assume, to be sure.
A report by Goddard consulting, which studied the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the Government, unknowingly the fabric exposed have been could.
2009 Goddard reported that the service ducts and pipes behind the Committee rooms of the Parliament with asbestos were contaminated, whose deadly Fasern could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are accused of often to worry about their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite would apply to.
While the Directorate of parliamentary work it was, that the Westminsterpalast had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years to be applied to renovate the Parliament, to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos and that after the general elections by 2015 members likely meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre are considered on the Green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out, that "the presence was handled by asbestos not according to the respective regulations."
No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never pinpoint the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year Abbott suspected that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I was in a hospital worked, in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember where you worked, and on the data for all places.
What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009, where he got some kind of fever.
He was 45, and conducted an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt horrible.
I felt no longer to make the journey home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain resulting from the pleura, the skin around his lungs around.
But as Janice all he had no reason to suspect a Mesothelioma.
He went a month not to work.
Astonished doctors took x-rays of his chest and set Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.
From time to time but the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
in 2011, came an Abbott's patient with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But now Abbott not combined this with his own case.
Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cavity between the ribs and the pleura.
I'm an optimist.
I'm moving on mostly easy,"he says.
Frankly, I was worried not so many.
But Rachel, my wife was worried.
Was the result of the biopsy in the week between Christmas and new year's day: "You told me that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, of which one advised him to hire a lawyer.
Only now, he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, developing now.
And so, mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were exposed to probably rather not the fabric.
But many employees who changed (such as Andrew Lawson) in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another or (as it often did Graham Abbott), ate in underground canteens were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It is evident, that for several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients were potentially life-saving, but life-threatening for the doctors.
It is still removed.
Students turned off her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.
And it concerns not only hospitals.
Due to its fabulous insulating and fire-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.
Also schools.
Actually, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, thousands of hours of chemistry, students have parked in her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often spoken on Web pages.
And meanwhile, as innocent items in our homes as flooring panels or shed roofs have by default contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison, that is included in large parts of our real estate," Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, noticed the Andrew Lawson it hospital took in his lawsuit against guy.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a concerned woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So beware how you tear off your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to move, but I realized that I could concentrate on that, which I did.
I was two weeks in practice.
Then I knew that I had to go and take care of me to myself.
Well, I will experience no more Christmas.
The change of perspective from the position of a physician to a patient was with the greatest difficulty.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information, which he had to cope with.
"It was very hard to take it all," he says.
"I asked my doctor,"how long do I have?""
And they gave me about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "well, I will experience no more Christmas.
It was then."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - even - breathing, that caused the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
If the asbestos is stirred up, and the fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in the pleura, lungs, skin.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and may cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with needlelike asbestos fibres inhaled," so Professor Tom Treasure, a heart chest physician, who in 2001, hospital transferred it to the guy.
Just the hospital, by the Andrew Lawson believed that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with some others that also probably were exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles can reach the lung tissue, says treasure, "pressed by the breathing process at the edge, where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the outset.
The usual options in other cancers not work as well in mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation is as hotly contested.
Some say that it was worth a try.
Treasure denied that.
"You can not cut out the pleura," he says.
You get around with a knife, not a question.
Meanwhile the cancer "on chemotherapy not reacts to very easily," which "has effect", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long term survivors," says treasure.
But they all die at the end.
Fortunately, some patients live in fact long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis still struggling Graham Abbott.
After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came four years in contact with Andrew Lawson, after his diagnosis a man support- and became a consulting Office for fellow sufferers.
"Hello, Cancer Center," he imagined himself cheerfully calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis of 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and extend his life expected to be only about a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson made it however "to appear the things in a somewhat positive light."
Following the advice of several doctors, Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic long Lazdunski, decided it to continue cardiac-thoracic specialist on the guy.
"We had an advantage by the fact that I not be had referred, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.
A normal patient would need to receive a wire transfer and must wait for the approval of treatment.
Money is critical for people with mesothelioma, to be eligible for the best available therapies.
But if these treatments fail eventually, inevitably, many of those affected by an other financial concerns - about the future of the families who left them.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.
But what is changing in the 1960s, that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.
And the negligence of the company to play a role started here.
Andrew Lawson and Guy it hospital put aside their case after all, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation", as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma an asbestos contact to the guy it was.
After the examination to his death a spokesman of the guy confirmed it but that "the asbestos fibers in the affected area of the cellar in the 1990s have been removed."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
It is actually for mesothelioma ill, seeking compensation, a huge problem, the deadly asbestos contact to assign a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employer have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time for her, but isn't quite sure with the plaintiffs.
In response there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers this year to seek compensation, even if their former employer to find no longer are.
The law has a Fund of 350 million funded by the insurance industry £ for all established after July 2012 were diagnosed, can prove a contact, who can sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them would be able to speak to about 120,000 pounds.
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers, that 350 million £ represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," says he, and indicates if this amount to one-fourth of that what insurers would have to pay, if the time it would have gone away and was diagnosed with mesothelioma find the companies and normally could sue them.
Also Mike Penning, of work and pension Minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both admitted penning such as Morgan, that given by seven deaths a day a quick action was necessary.
"The people suffer so much and now need help," Paez said in December of last year during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law.
At this point, Graham Abbott was 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic long Lazdunski.
After their initial discussions, long Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with the long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"This is of course with the most important," Abbott says.
You see that time and again in patients.
It's something that can make you more.
If you give up, you're very rapidly worse.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery March 2012.
End of August he had the last the six cycles of chemotherapy behind.
Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were more cancer spots around my chest.
I was just 50.
That is not life-threatening.
This is life-ending.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No sign of tumors is now more visible.
But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.
You must be thinking to practical things - about the money, if I am not, for example, or my wife show how the water heater setting.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.
"For parents, this is hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease, I would be not old.
They responded quite differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we were soon very many calls.
Ellie was restrained.
She said not much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks not of hope are not crossed, by a trace of hope of survival.
The disease brings (so as ultimately to Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
