Cyclists, joggers and walkers were present yesterday at 8 cycling on the big box Hill and have thus supports the Association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, was a light training for the others.
In one were however all agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski might have slept well last night.
Because for the first time in his life of the Chief of the Oberursel brewery went yesterday with the wheel on the Feldberg.
For a good cause.
He can put away as easily the small muscles, especially the participation of 8 cycling on the big field mountain in favor of the Association "Help for children with cancer" (Frankfurt) personally brought him a valuable insight.
A great thing.
"I now know that I can do this - prima!"
Small little break in the curve of the applause?
No, if I would have stopped once it was out...
As Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel City Parliament, itself plagued many of 718 participants yesterday in the morning dew to mountains and came to close, but happy on the plateau of exhaustion.
However, it fell another easier to overcome the 11-kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example Norman Dießner.
The occurring in red green politician from the district day - red dress, red bike - made at the start of something else on understatement ("lots of professionals, since arriving is the goal!"), proved but on the mountain but half professional and went after 45 minutes without shortness of breath through the target.
He also went the distance in one go, as also Nina Kuhn, spokeswoman of the city Oberursel had taken together with Frank Garcia on the way.
For the two triathletes the "field mountain biking" was not necessarily a challenge: "here it goes to charity, because we are happy with – but we had an exit today anyway" Kuhn.
On the way they had made Paul Wenzel of Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) drove down the morning after Oberursel to return almost immediately to struggle on the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swooped in the morning at 9: 00 at home in the saddle, "made" the Feldberg twice, to then roll with fun home.
Fun had also "fries-Toni".
For the Chief of the Oberurseler cult kiosks cycling over the field Hill part.
He had targeted 40 minutes with his 6.5 pound road bike.
A crazy event.
"For this purpose — because I'm in love", Andreas Balzke said.
The trained Mainz says, that he is an "ambitious racing cyclists".
That must be it, because he was traveling with the "fixie-wheel", although road bikes, but are without...
That locker was also without wheel upwards, proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the white wall and the Fox dance to the top up, but also as a Jogger, who moved here a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
"Mountain rescue doctor Professor Volker Lischke, which equipped with all-wheel drive-bully and quad, made with his team, for security, said:"The know"I from Frankfurt, who trained for a special Schlittentrail, except that he just draws the carriage". So to speak, the man is his own sled dog.
718 participants - and so many like never before – were sent in the morning in groups on the track.
The walkers first at 9:30.
There followed the first cyclists and runners at 10: 00.
Five minutes later the first mountain bikers laid off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association "Crest on the Feldberg", gave the start command and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it is able to block the route to the peak up to the safety of the participants.
