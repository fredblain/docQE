With Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC has found the great Director, it needs.
She arrives with a proud glory train from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And it has its own front experience.
Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and co., which moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world by Pearsons.
She was Chairman of the financial times for seven years and stepped down as the top item of the parent company of Pearson to a younger male colleague went.
Their settlement was reportedly nearly 1 million pounds.
Also her political ranking is solid.
She was recommended David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, when it was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became the Counselor of the Cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory Councillor.
In may, I described the purpose of the Chair with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The Trust works in two directions: to the inside on the first guard of its management hierarchy at the BBC, but outward as the voice public concern and unrest, when things go wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly, which calls for a full comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming President would risk to compete, to embark on everything and to take apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he himself perhaps brings to his job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if this were not enough, are also still many interested is reduced to see BBC -, money and status.
While closer to the competition and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, it is connected to the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC with special hazards.
For the modest sum of Â£145.50 per year and buys up the British public in the certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says that she reached 96 percent of all households and only 40 pence per day costs each of them.
And apparently the BBC goes on the popularity scale back upwards: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent a decade ago.
The vision and habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines today on my cell phone and catch missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.
She needs a considerable Chairman - I hope she has found him.
