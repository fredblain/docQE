Judge temporarily stops law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana might force the closure
A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, lawyers say that it probably would have resulted in the closure of all five abortion clinics in the State on Sunday.
This measure, which was elevated in June to the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, and takes effect on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions, to acquire a patient recording right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to her practice.
The judge's decision, however, mean that doctors can temporarily continue to legally perform abortions while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue compliance with the law, while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote in his ruling Federal Judge John deGravelles.
A hearing for the judge is applied within one month, to bring a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors could win more time to gain hospital in instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escaped a sneaky law that them want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for reproductive rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also on the doctors from the two hospitals stretched, who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 States that have enacted similar laws, courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for unconstitutional.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the hospitals in the State to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, and the American Medical Association say unanimously that permit rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors.
Abortion opponents argue that the measures serve the protection of women's health, though some welcomed the impact of the closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has patient a banksman privileges, said the Center for reproductive rights.
If all other doctors in the State are forced to perform no more abortions, this doctor out of fear would no longer perform the operation for his safety, the group said.
In her arguments against the verdict, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would punish doctors for performing abortions, while their patient banksman real applications were still pending.
