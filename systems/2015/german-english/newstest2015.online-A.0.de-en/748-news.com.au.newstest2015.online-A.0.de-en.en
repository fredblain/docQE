Flown to teenagers from the blue mountains
TWO young Bush walkers were brought with the winch to safety after they were trapped in the NSW blue mountains overnight.
THE 16-year old girl and the 19 year-old man departed to their tour shortly after Sunday lunch at Govetts leap in Blackheath.
Worried relatives called the police at about 8: 00, when the two go home were returned.
A posse of local police and rescue services broke up and the pair was found to about 23: 00 close of Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured his knee and the man fell and was smashed on his head.
Rescue workers stayed overnight at the pair, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were hospitalized in stable condition with an ambulance in the Blue Mountains hospital.
