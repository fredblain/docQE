Production in the euro zone to a 13-month low
The increase in the production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely watched study with.
The final Markit purchasing managers index of manufacturing (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, according to a State of 51.8 in July.
An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia via the Ukraine.
The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro zone, as well as for the impending deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3% from the Bank.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, in the course of this week further information could make, if he pulls a quantitative easing for the euro area into account, according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers were clear," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the biggest trading partner of Russia in the EU fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.
In the meantime, the PMI on 46.9 fell in the second largest economy of the bloc, France.
France remains a concern, such as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer have access, are also not reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.
The decline in the industry probably fuels the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS global insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone by August, is that after the sector continues to grow."
He added: "manufacturers in the eurozone find life currently obviously quite difficult because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and the Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the ongoing difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and causes probably that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that there would be "increasingly likely" that the ECB finally must initiate a kind of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."
