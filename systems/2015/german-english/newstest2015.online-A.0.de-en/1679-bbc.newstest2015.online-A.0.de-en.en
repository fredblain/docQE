Kenya registered officials to curb "Ghost employees"
Kenya has begun to register all State officials to remove "Ghost employees" from the payrolls of Government biometrically.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks, would no longer be paid, was a Government communication.
The Government believed that thousands of people receive more salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised when he took office to 2013 to combat corruption in the public service.
During a test at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million $ (£700,000) lost a month on payments for "Ghost employees" and other abusive financial practices.
Wanyama Chebusiri reported the Government suspected that salaries continue to be paid on accounts, after a person has died or leaving the public service, for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must appear in the next two weeks at identification centres, to ensure that their data via the biometric registration are recorded, was communicated in a Government message.
All who would not do this without a credible excuse would be slashed from the payroll, the release was further.
"Through this approach is contributed to the rationalization of the public service, by the actual number of civil servants is determined and the content list on both levels of Government will be adjusted – so the"ghost employees"are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of decentralization and planning.
