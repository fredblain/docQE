Putin demanded the inclusion of "Rule of talks" with the Eastern Ukraine Kiev
The Russian President Wladimir Putin according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian Government is fighting against the separatists in the East of the country and immediately takes up with negotiations to the "rule"of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made it clear later that Putin didn't mean the territory under the control of the separatists of the Eastern Ukraine to become part of Russia, but that his status against the Ukraine must be redefined, to give the power to represent their rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region.
Putin's call to the Kiev Government to negotiations on equal footing with the pro Russian rebel suits but which by him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently strategy: help for the separatists in the business areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of providing with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture of the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately occupied area as "Novorossija" or "New Russia" referred to a term that the Russian Empire is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday.
Putin pointed out that those who hope for Ukrainian politician for the elections on Oct. 26, while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists in the course of the campaigns early peace talks are "trapped in their illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We need to record immediately detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the State status of the South-East Ukraine, to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's reference to the rule of law in the context of the greater autonomy should be seen, discussed for months by the leadership of Kiev to allay concerns in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.
Only the Ukrainian Government can give the necessary autonomy the eastern areas, said Peskov.
We are not talking about negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it isn't about a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, but an internal conflict in the Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscore the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, where ethnic Russians are the majority of the 2 million inhabitants.
Moscow would be far greater, to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and polls indicate a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine from the time before the conflict began.
The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats on international forums would proxy give the regional Governments in the Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreement and external relations, and de facto control over an area so the Kremlin, type that combines the Russian territory in Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago annexed is the home port for the bulk of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - should bear in mind additions to the Constitution after new elections - that greater control is given the respective territories about their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be their arming and incitement Moscow accused in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels.
Putin's last call to Kiev, to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level, followed a further advance of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated beyond the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in the Eastern Ukraine.
The separatists supported by Russia took control of Nowoasowsk in the coup, which is according to fears Ukrainian security official to the Crimea, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal area.
For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol, a steel industry port of 500,000 to fix, which is situated between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds, to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent since 23 years.
"We are nearing a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk, after last week invaded the Donezkregion, said two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian national security and Defense Council reports to support the besieged separatists on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were closed by the Russian incursion in Ilovaysk, against 10 Russian paratroopers were exchanged on Sunday who had been captured to Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.
