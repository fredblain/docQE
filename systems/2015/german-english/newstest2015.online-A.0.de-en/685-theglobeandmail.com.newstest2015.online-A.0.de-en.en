Smart ways to save for university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1,000 amount per year, the almost second semester student Matt Schroeder pondered throwing a clever idea of saving himself.
He invented a system of loans for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation, to delay the resale.
"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester had him $430 cost, he said.
He gave $120 from.
The College Board told the students in the more than 1,200 average $ annually spend on textbooks and study materials that there is cost containment options for the students, however.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeder's increasingly are the solution of choice for students.
