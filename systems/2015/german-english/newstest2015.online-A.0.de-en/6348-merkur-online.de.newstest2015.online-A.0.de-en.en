Pull the Castle clubs soon back together?
Last, there was strife between the two Wolfratshauser Castle clubs again and again.
Now think the Board members about a possible collaboration.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle of the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman led the Wolfratshauser Castle friends, the project in the French Guédelon.
A year ago, there was a not a good climate between the Association of the Castle and the Castle friends Wolfratshausen.
The views of how the story should be dealt with the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different so far.
Now the two sides are moving each other: it talks about a common approach to be taken soon.
Board members Torsten Sjöberg (Castle Association) and Herbert Piffl (Castle friends) confirm that demand our newspaper.
"I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we once could sit down together," reported Sjöberg.
All members of both clubs could pull his opinion in the future again together.
Faster visible results can be so recorded.
While the castle's friends to the suddenly departed Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye until the last minute, the "development and experience bar making" the grounds at the forefront stands for the Castle Club to Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, second of Chairman of the friends of the Castle, has delighted according to own statements about the call.
Since Dimbaths death, he faces the Castle friends.
A new President is to be found in mid-September at a General Assembly.
Currently is one of the association according to the 74 around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath have we let the club activities out of respect at first". This "thinking"phase may have been necessary, "to consider how it could continue".
According to Pak, the new Chairman should then go into the conversation with the Castle Club.
Until then the castle's friends could make a current mood image within their grouping.
Pak says, there is no a candidate for the Presidency at the moment yet.
"But I'm confident that someone will find". He himself will not run because he takes up residence in bad Tölz.
The new Chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted work on the project "but very happy to continue with".
The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls probably in the near future.
It commends Dimbath as a "Missionary", who always believed that the reconstruction of the Castle.
Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is no pie in the sky.
Through a high level of participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world to be a tourist magnet.
Pak: "I was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time I have come more and more to the conviction, that it makes sense to promote the project. A "unique selling proposition" for the city of rafters could be created.
There's nothing else here.
Moreover, the project through EU grants, tickets for visitors and potential sponsors would be fundable, believes Pak.
"I want to personally therefore not simply jettisoning the idea of reconstruction". He hoped that maybe something that moves the Castle Club in this point.
Aimed initially to document the history, "is important and good."
Then you could see.
