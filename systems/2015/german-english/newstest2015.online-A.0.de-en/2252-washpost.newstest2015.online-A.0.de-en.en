China denies Hong Kong right to choice of Government, demonstrators sworn vengeance
On Sunday the Chinese Parliament despite of the increased calls decided after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the electorate of Hong Kong.
This approach probably fired the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists to led the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement in the way.
The decision of the Chinese people's Congress generally allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates not loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us yet angry," legal expert Emily said LAU, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
You lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision said Li Fei, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the national of people's Congress, that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be to "messy".
Since 1997, when Great Britain control over Hong Kong back the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants from 2017 choose chaired Government.
China's leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote to citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear, that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a Nominating Committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in hand.
To allow only candidates "with love for the country and love Hong Kong" after a new clause.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and due protests in Hong Kong were held for many years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement stands occupy Central with love and peace, whose Organisatoren have threatened to seal off the financial district, if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of occupy Central trailers in the rain in front of the Government Headquarters in Hong Kong had gathered within hours of the announcement.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest waves, they planned in the coming weeks.
You made this apparently to avoid problems with the authorities, but no further details.
In an online message informed the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort drew, an action that should only take place if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
Sorry to have to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared for days to Beijing's announcement, and there were stricter security measures including police and barricades on Sunday in front of the Government building.
The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that they slowly lose control over their city.
The influx of people from the Mainland increased the competition for products and services.
Also, the fear that the values begin to erode Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under growing pressure from Beijing is growing.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong -.
"The protests, of which they speak, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved in and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who criticized the movement for a long time.
We want to incite any fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's State-controlled media also recently reported the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum to the discretions which 780,000 people attended - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region took part.
