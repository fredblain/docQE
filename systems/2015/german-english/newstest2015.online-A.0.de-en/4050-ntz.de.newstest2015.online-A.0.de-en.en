Sergeant a. D. Berni Diether works since the closure of the former training area as scorcher
For almost ten years is no longer shot on the former military training area in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, lethal ammunition in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere region occurs every month.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they must be blown up on-site.
A deafening bang echoed in the blasting through the heart of the biosphere region.
In December 2004, was the last sharp shot on the training area of Münsingen, which was closed in late 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area is the heart of the biosphere area, Swabian Alb, which is open on 13 designated trails for hikers and cyclists.
