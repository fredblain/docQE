Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the place of the new countries, refugees are now housed in tents.
The Central first contact for refugees in Harburg, bursting at the seams.
Now have three tents of the Red Cross also set up the inner authority.
District politicians were informed only shortly before - they're little excited.
"This year actions Stoke further reservations of citizens and give the district politicians unable to contribute constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees," says about Britta Herrmann, parliamentary leader of the Greens in the Harburg district meeting.
Her party asks that the County Harburg is currently unused houses to the accommodation available.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the first contact are the onslaught by seeking help - and the fact that the authorities can provide insufficient places in consequence facilities.
Many refugees remain thus longer than the regular three months.
