As the 2nd table tennis district class for the purpose of streamlining the leagues Division has been deleted some time ago, it has been the a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation, an additional 3 took the Bundesliga in the program.
The result: Who has not risen, is descended.
Göttingen class highest team has avoided relegation torpedo in the Premier League-relegation while, plays in the coming season but still fifth class size only.
Fourth class-torpedoes remain women, despite their grandiose move in the Regionalliga.
The boys and girls of torpedo launch in the Lower Saxony League, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
SG Lenglern and the torpedo reserves compete in the new Verbandsliga, not Göttingen clubs are more represented in the National League.
In the women's plays the TTV Geismar in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo-second in the National League.
What looks like a better class of district, the composition is now the new district upper League South.
Here Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, torpedo join TSV III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, the FC Weser and the TTC.
In the Bezirksliga, II, red white, Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III play as regional representative Dransfeld and the SC Weende, in the district class of the TTC. The Bezirksoberliga of women starts at least in strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II here are part of the game.
In the Bezirksliga start running torpedo III and semi Hausen/Redwood Mars Hausen.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girl in the small district League.
Also the district League season of the SCW-boys - there still torpedo launches II — is not complete.
In a class of district Tuspo Weende, Geismar and Bovender SV go in the season.
The two Göttingen district leagues with nine teams start in the first season of the newly formed Association of the region.
In the West II, Bovender SV III, Laubach are the red and white II, torpedo IV and V, MTV grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mahlamvu and SG Lenglern II.
In the East playing semi Hausen/Redwood Mars Hausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen, among others.
The women's County League consists of Satte city/Redwood Mars Hausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen Tuspo Weende, II, the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the District of Osterode, where there is even no women's teams more on district level.
Striking that none of the six 2.Kreisklassen strength achieved, here the innovative and enterprising District Board will have to worry ever.
