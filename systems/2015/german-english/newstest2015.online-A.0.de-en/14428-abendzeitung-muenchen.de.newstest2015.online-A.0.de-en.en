After election in Saxony, Germany: CDU Deputy Chairman Strobl questioning NPD ban process
Given the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony CDU Deputy Federal Chairman Thomas Strobl has opted for an end of the NPD ban on proceedings before the Constitutional Court.
Ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD before the Federal Constitutional Court should see an end to Berlin - according to Thomas Strobl CDU federal deputy.
"The NPD scores worse than last time", said Strobl, who is also the CDU land chief in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is an encouraging development in the right direction and development, who rather come to the conclusion that that to fight the NPD politically and not in front of the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed in the vote on Sunday close to the five percent hurdle.
A first attempt to ban of the far-right party failed in 2003, because the protection of the Constitution at the time in the top of the NPD had informants.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new claim in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
Federal Government and the Bundestag not joined.
