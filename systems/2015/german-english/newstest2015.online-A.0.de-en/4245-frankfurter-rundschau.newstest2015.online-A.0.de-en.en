Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's sister city in China now wants a brewery and hopes also on a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's sister city, Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of the official in China.
"We would be happy, if a German brewery would settle down in our city", the Deputy Party Secretary said the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his town.
The functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China in the course of conversation on this concern repeatedly returned the metropolis of 12 million.
Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, promoted Li.
Therefore, the people have also the purchasing power to make German beer.
The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Saeed, who led the German delegation of politicians, said the host, he'll ask around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It not much need for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre", he added during the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou.
Mr. Li already transmit this joy of life, he flattered the hosts.

More business traffic
A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flights between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Deputy party chief Li.

Currently travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
Also the administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hoping the flight connection.
The Vice Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, turned this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.
"This is a very good idea", said Saeed - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, nodded.
Well maintained partnership
The affable Vice Party Chief of Guangzhou is hoping that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.
He was originally in the Office this year after his predecessor out of Office on corruption charges had been promoted.
The local Party Chief Wan Qinglian had to go.
The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced by leader Xi Jinping with hardness.
The new leaders of Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Before taking office in Guangzhou he worked as official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially more than a dozen town-twinning.
The connection to the 9000 km from Guangzhou is among those that are maintained by both sides, with a student exchange.
The 25-year anniversary of the german Chinese connection was celebrated last year.
The South China city on the Pearl River is almost as strong as Hesse with its economic power.
She wants to achieve a GDP of 250 billion euros next year, reported Li.
