On the bouncy castle at the Castle Garden Festival, a lot was going on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers agreed.
Despite strong torrential rain on Saturday night, music fans an estimated 1200 came to the Open-Air Festival in the castle garden.
At times, the intake had to be stopped.
"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l light and fun.
Of two Spanish words, Dr. have made the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem.
Because the open air in the castle garden Salzwedeler should radiate brightness on the day and in the evening with various shows.
Well, and the fun comes anyway by alone.
It became apparent early Saturday, when the first visitors to the open air.
The organisers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stands in the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.
Watched the first live performances, bobbed with the foot to the beat, enjoyed cold drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.
And across the generations.
While is the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten, others used to wine in the wine cellar at a quarter, raged the offspring on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the younger guests.
But also at the face painting volunteers in the truest sense of the word had busy all hands to the crowds to become and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The larger used Foosball tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which directed the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17:30 he pelting down on the visitors, mainly families searched for the vast and dry.
However, this did not diminish the attractiveness of the Festival.
"There were more people than expected", said Ron Sem which spoke of a "success across the Board".
Therefore nothing precludes next year a repetition of the big party.
Although content and size of the event still needs to work on, SEM made it clear in a first record on Sunday to the people's voice.
He described as annoying, and that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm with too little force was been booked.
As a result, Some of those who had already paid, were no longer on the site.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate of Salzwedeler with co-organisers spoke of about 1200 visitors, who are busy in the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The hip hop band block 'n' ROX Salzwedeler broke off their appearance so unnerved.
The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.
The planned shisha lounges could not be rebuilt because the tents because of a flat tire could not be brought to Salzwedel.
"Next year they will be but here", so the Organizer.
The premiere of Dr. open airs succeeded more than by the number of visitors.
And the bad weather.
However, the organizers have committed some error which still be forgiven the first time, but must be disposed of in the Second Edition.
Also on the social network Facebook, the Organizer must insert criticism.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros you expected just more" reflected Melanie Meier on the event page.
"You have taken over you unfortunately a bit", ele says Zakaria at the same place.
Others see the initial problems not so tight.
I find it very good, some just don't talk, but really try to put something on the legs.
Hats off! ", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Srinivas.
Now time the organizers a year, to make these criticisms.
