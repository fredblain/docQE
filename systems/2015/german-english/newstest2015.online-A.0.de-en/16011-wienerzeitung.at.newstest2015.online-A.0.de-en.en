Konstantin alarm brutally honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony as a biography, what brought singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker, pacifist, politsicher activist, ex-con, "Monk and warriors" on 287 pages to paper.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts scraps for scraps of thoughts of the Munich born on June 1, 1947, has written his memoirs, initiated each chapter by a matching lyrics.
And he is brutally honest here: by the masturbation as a high school student to the shoplifting and drug use he omits no human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Also abstract, but the more important items occupy: love, ego, being in the now, soul, spirituality - all he tried on the reason to go, very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he explains his social criticism, also its pacifism, his political involvement - and also, how not only the music has influenced him (the Opera lovers became the soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter is closer to the Bon Vivant Konstantin Wecker also the ascetic monk, resulting "subtraction", as he says, "while making away everything unnecessary".
Between all the hochgeistigen views, there are also brief anecdotes about the Earth: about brawling in a bar frequented by GIs or a crazy drive in which he targeted head-on a tree.
There, he is brutally honest.
