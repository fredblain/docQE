"Pork House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a House for sale has been removed by real estate agents when it became obvious that it showed a large pig, had made himself comfortable there in the living room.
The detached House has a bedroom, located on a private road in Ipswich and is for £120,000 offered.
To the details was a picture of the living room of the House - to which even a pig belonged, that had surrounded his head on a sofa.
Real estate agents of Connells said the pig in the photo is the pet of owner.
"The photo was published but mistakenly has been removed in the meantime" a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the exposé of the House, Connells described the former meeting House as a "unique House with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it appears on promotional material.
The House sale caused interest in social media, as some wondered whether the pig in the price is included.
