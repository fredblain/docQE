Lenny Henry: my father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when was Henry 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsing it for a comedy, Rudy's rare records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.
"Many" therapies he visited after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father.
It was hard to know.
You never saw his face, hear his voice: "stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who already grow up were when I was a kid â€“ went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the glass of beer or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.
I never had such a conversation with him.
He was a big part of my life that serious guy in the corner, read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than they were during his father's, he won but insight into how life for him may have been.
It is now lighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke, and lots of carbon.
My father earlier just lay down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he to sing started because he could wash the Foundry itself.
As I walked around there, I realized he had done that for many years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
However, Henry as a child without affection of his parents grew up.
My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".
Only when it went bad my mother at the end of their lives, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you".
By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.
Could you time with the "I love you" stop?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why should we be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still a friend of French, with which he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why should we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
When I was so very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you need to be radical.
So I pulled out this fitness thing and had to also a drastic diet, to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant, close-cropped beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is engrossed by the theatre.
This was followed by the comedy of errors, and then fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him on new faces.
His television career began in the mid of 1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian in television for a long, long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow not only in front of the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how I could become an efficient jokes tell machine while I through television was a star, and it was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 when new faces
Manager be the stage right on the black and white minstrel show had, Henry his comedy light entertainment, where people "black painted on", performed there over five years.
That was my family very uncomfortable.
I kinda wish that it never would have happened, but I do not regret I did it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this 'years of award-winning light pillar of British television' was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
With the introduction of characters, the British black culture both mocked as celebrated, Henry worked in the 1980s to an alternate Comedykreis.
The first series of the Lenny Henry show in 1984 went on the air, and in the nineties he was Chief among the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series! known.
His next decade dominated advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his BBC series, he thought LennyHenry.tv 2008: "what are you doing next, Len, because it feels everything, as you bring out only the time or step a little on the spot."
Then there came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled what so great about...?
The first episode is turned to Shakespeare.
I was literally allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned something about him at school and kept him mostly for a domain of middle-class, white tights and a cabbage in front.
So I had great fear before.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.
Don't do it badly, if you don't know what you are talking about.
Take a few of the words in his mouth, and then you will understand why we so love all Shakespeare.
Henry performed 20 rows from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do this.
It was almost, as if someone had set up right the head me.
"It comes it's a serious thing, she take this seriously, learn your lines, research a bit."
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
I was suddenly in the national theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had entertained the audience.
"A little voice told me"You need to bypass now 10 minutes while they repair the computer.""
Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea of were to continue, as soon as the problem had been solved.
I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God".
I am not responsible.
I can leave that to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre
It was challenging to learn the text for fences.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This was well received, so it's like a large sign of the gods, telling me "This is your destiny." "
He says this, of course, with a THUNDERING voice.
So I stick to it.
I really love that.
I love to be in a rehearsal room.
Henry has still the head of a comedian - our conversation is traversed by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people again and again.
I decided to make no stand-up comedy, because I find that this kind of instant gratification by a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you are looking for all the time that, it drives it against a wall.
I perform sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want to, but overall it gives me not so much as before.
I ask him whether he will make ever again a stand Comedytour.
The fun I have in a room with a Director, which helps to shape a beginning, a middle, and the end of a trip - I don't think that I ever want to give up.
So here is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I'm like an actor.
It's fun.
It always is a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
