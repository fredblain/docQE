Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies in the country increased slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly released study in the past week, and the company made no exception in the Washington area.
Companies in the space district, Maryland and 27.6 billion paid Virginia together $ on State and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the revenue by 2012 in $ 26.6 billion $.
The State and local tax burden of companies rose last year by 4.3 percent to 671 billion $ on, compared to 3.9 per cent in the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining notices in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for state taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from businesses.
Virginia scored the lowest tax revenues from companies with 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in revenue is due to a recovery of the real estate assets of the companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase of in real estate taxes 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from large States like California, New York and Texas, the procedure also for the Washington area seems to apply.
Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together over 10 billion paid $ on State and local real estate taxes last year, compared with 9.6 billion $2012 - an increase in the course of one year by 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in improving State and local tax revenue in Maryland, because here the real estate taxes on slightly more than one-fifth of the tax assessment notices from companies amounted to.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their State and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, the following occurs: a large part of real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the Government or by non-profits, that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely to provide the same services that offer other States, for example, much more on income taxes.
The recent recovery in the tax revenue from companies can be expected to not only the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate earnings seem also to recover the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for State organizations of 2.3 billion $ compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion $ a in corporate income tax, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies in all three places rises evenly.
The increase rate in the district was with 4.3 percent national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue by 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax with 6 percent in all three areas of the Office (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rate).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is relatively high 9,975 percent at 8.25 percent and in the district.
A comparable study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia require less State and local business taxes and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The district was not examined in the study.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.
North Carolina has adopted the same set as Virginia laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, and the rate will fall next year to 5 percent.
If the State still achieves its goals of income in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the State until 2017 at 3%.
In the meantime, it seems better to go the small businesses in the Washington area, and they pay so more State and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes that is paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transition structure, according to the most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $ at a significantly faster growth rate than the corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country probably will stop in this year, with an increase in the General more military tax revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, the Washington area could lag behind when the spending of the Federal Government affects the labour market in the region.
