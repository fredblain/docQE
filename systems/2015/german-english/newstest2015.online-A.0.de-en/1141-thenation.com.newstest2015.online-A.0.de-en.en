Go back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the Organization of trade unions as civil rights.
"Such as trade unions, die, die also the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Deputy Chairman of the progressive caucus in the Congress.
Therefore, I imagine the employee empowerment law proudly alongside the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This ground-breaking legislation gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the grounds of the Organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces.
The addition of the national labour law, for discrimination to make a way exposed workers to organize of a trade union representative, to sue in a civil court for Justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.
But it is not a radical initiative - with security anyway, according to American standards.
Indeed, is the best way to understand of what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill proposing, the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks, the unions suffered in the past few years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States across the country - Americans have encouraged once countries all over the world, to recognise labour rights to extend and maintain.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organise in the same breath.
When after the second world war, Japan occupied the United States, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution that should ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy Hedki Tojo.
Knowing full well, that the workers and their unions in the creation of a new Japan assumed a role, she used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers on Union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
As the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Should, in recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise and raise their voice in the new nation the Germans added a clause which explicitly stated: "guarantees the right to form associations is the working and economic conditions to secure and improve each and every trade or business.
Agreements that restrict this right or aiming to reduce it are null and void; that targeted measures are illegal.
As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship of the International Commission on human rights, was designed by the Universal Declaration of human rights as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors guarantees added, that "everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them."
For generations, Americans the basic premise accept that labour rights are human rights.
As this country advised other countries as one could form a civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a Union - and that the Union should - then participate in collective bargaining as equal partner with companies and Government agencies must be protected.
After these rights came under attack in America it is indeed wise to lead the American ideal in mind, as a result, workers have the right to unite and to get heard in a free and open society.
As pastor said fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Jr.:
The history is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labour movement not restricted the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.
The story recalls, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil liberties as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which largely did America in the past and broke up the promise of democracy.
