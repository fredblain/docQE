<seg id="1">Go back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a legislative proposal to establish the Organization of trade unions as civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Such as trade unions, die, die also the middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and Deputy Chairman of the progressive caucus in the Congress.</seg>
<seg id="4">Therefore, I imagine the employee empowerment law proudly alongside the civil rights icon John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking legislation gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination on the grounds of the Organization of trade unions as other forms of discrimination - and stops so antigewerkschaftlich set forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The addition of the national labour law, for discrimination to make a way exposed workers to organize of a trade union representative, to sue in a civil court for Justice - and to obtain damages or fines - is a useful and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is not a radical initiative - with security anyway, according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, is the best way to understand of what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill proposing, the connection back to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks, the unions suffered in the past few years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other States across the country - Americans have encouraged once countries all over the world, to recognise labour rights to extend and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country was called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organise in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When after the second world war, Japan occupied the United States, General Douglas MacArthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a Constitution that should ensure that the militarized autocracy would be replaced by democracy Hedki Tojo.</seg>
<seg id="12">Knowing full well, that the workers and their unions in the creation of a new Japan assumed a role, she used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers on Union and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">As the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a Constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Should, in recognition of the fact that the workers would need to organise and raise their voice in the new nation the Germans added a clause which explicitly stated: "guarantees the right to form associations is the working and economic conditions to secure and improve each and every trade or business.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or aiming to reduce it are null and void; that targeted measures are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the chairmanship of the International Commission on human rights, was designed by the Universal Declaration of human rights as adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors guarantees added, that "everyone has the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or to join them."</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans the basic premise accept that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">As this country advised other countries as one could form a civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a Union - and that the Union should - then participate in collective bargaining as equal partner with companies and Government agencies must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights came under attack in America it is indeed wise to lead the American ideal in mind, as a result, workers have the right to unite and to get heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As pastor said fifty years ago, Martin Luther King Jr.:</seg>
<seg id="21">The history is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labour movement not restricted the strength of the nation, but increased it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously has created a market for the industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the work, forget these simple truths, but the story keeps them.</seg>
<seg id="25">The story recalls, and we should do that.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil liberties as protection against discrimination in the creation of employee representatives - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals which largely did America in the past and broke up the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="2">A U.S. federal judge temporarily stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana, lawyers say that it probably would have resulted in the closure of all five abortion clinics in the State on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">This measure, which was elevated in June to the law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, and takes effect on Sept. 1, would force doctors who perform abortions, to acquire a patient recording right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to her practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">The judge's decision, however, mean that doctors can temporarily continue to legally perform abortions while they apply for such a right.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs can continue compliance with the law, while they strive to obtain these rights," wrote in his ruling Federal Judge John deGravelles.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing for the judge is applied within one month, to bring a more permanent decision for the law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures and said that doctors could win more time to gain hospital in instruction rights.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana escaped a sneaky law that them want to take their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for reproductive rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the five hospitals in the State to stop the law.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also on the doctors from the two hospitals stretched, who had not joined the lawsuit and also applied for admission rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 States that have enacted similar laws, courts have recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for unconstitutional.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the hospitals in the State to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, and the American Medical Association say unanimously that permit rights require unnecessary restrictions by doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents argue that the measures serve the protection of women's health, though some welcomed the impact of the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana, has patient a banksman privileges, said the Center for reproductive rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the State are forced to perform no more abortions, this doctor out of fear would no longer perform the operation for his safety, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In her arguments against the verdict, representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they would punish doctors for performing abortions, while their patient banksman real applications were still pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: my father never took me in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children in a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when was Henry 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry rehearsing it for a comedy, Rudy's rare records, partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father, emerged from the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult moments of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Many" therapies he visited after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship to his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was hard to know.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, hear his voice: "stop the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move it!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who already grow up were when I was a kid – went with him to the pub and talked about things like the shape of the glass of beer or the beauty of a Cricketschlags.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was a big part of my life that serious guy in the corner, read the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than they were during his father's, he won but insight into how life for him may have been.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is now lighter, but they are dark, smoky, deep Stygian mazes with bursts of flame and smoke, and lots of carbon.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father earlier just lay down in the tub and then you could hear him slowly as he to sing started because he could wash the Foundry itself.</seg>
<seg id="20">As I walked around there, I realized he had done that for many years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry as a child without affection of his parents grew up.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you".</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when it went bad my mother at the end of their lives, we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you".</seg>
<seg id="24">By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you time with the "I love you" stop?</seg>
<seg id="26">Stop hugging me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">with Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still a friend of French, with which he was married 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">This contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">When I was so very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "you need to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I pulled out this fitness thing and had to also a drastic diet, to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's career change is perhaps reflected in his elegant, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is engrossed by the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">This was followed by the comedy of errors, and then fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled out his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote about him on new faces.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid of 1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian in television for a long, long time."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to grow not only in front of the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985 learn how I could become an efficient jokes tell machine while I through television was a star, and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny 1975 when new faces</seg>
<seg id="52">Manager be the stage right on the black and white minstrel show had, Henry his comedy light entertainment, where people "black painted on", performed there over five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">That was my family very uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="54">I kinda wish that it never would have happened, but I do not regret I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this 'years of award-winning light pillar of British television' was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">With the introduction of characters, the British black culture both mocked as celebrated, Henry worked in the 1980s to an alternate Comedykreis.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of the Lenny Henry show in 1984 went on the air, and in the nineties he was Chief among the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series! known.</seg>
<seg id="59">His next decade dominated advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles, but after his BBC series, he thought LennyHenry.tv 2008: "what are you doing next, Len, because it feels everything, as you bring out only the time or step a little on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then there came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled what so great about...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode is turned to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was literally allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never really learned something about him at school and kept him mostly for a domain of middle-class, white tights and a cabbage in front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had great fear before.</seg>
<seg id="65">All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't do it badly, if you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Take a few of the words in his mouth, and then you will understand why we so love all Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry performed 20 rows from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost, as if someone had set up right the head me.</seg>
<seg id="71">"It comes it's a serious thing, she take this seriously, learn your lines, research a bit."</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">I was suddenly in the national theatre and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed." "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had entertained the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice told me"You need to bypass now 10 minutes while they repair the computer.""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage manager announced that the idea of were to continue, as soon as the problem had been solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave that to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, so stay in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">It was challenging to learn the text for fences.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">This was well received, so it's like a large sign of the gods, telling me "This is your destiny." "</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, with a THUNDERING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I stick to it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love that.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry has still the head of a comedian - our conversation is traversed by humorous outbursts, while he imitates people again and again.</seg>
<seg id="94">I decided to make no stand-up comedy, because I find that this kind of instant gratification by a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you are looking for all the time that, it drives it against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I perform sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want to, but overall it gives me not so much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him whether he will make ever again a stand Comedytour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun I have in a room with a Director, which helps to shape a beginning, a middle, and the end of a trip - I don't think that I ever want to give up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So here is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I'm like an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's fun.</seg>

<seg id="9">A year after that the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.</seg>
<seg id="11">It went after several months in a camp in 1946 in Bavaria - in the boxcar.</seg>
<seg id="12">So moved judges in the upper Franconian village of sinks.</seg>
<seg id="13">Teacher training took place in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">Manfred Richter had a week six times running 10 km to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg to there three kilometres across the whole city to the school go and back in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, Manfred Richter got a sleep in a red cross home in Bamberg: along with upto 15 classmates in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">in 1951, he made the first and 1954 after three years teaching candidate the second State examination.</seg>

<seg id="18">The "Miss room" was his first "service apartment" in the schoolhouse.</seg>
<seg id="19">in 1958, he moved into a three bedroom service apartment in the newly built Lehrerhaus next to the school.</seg>

<seg id="23">When the school Indian village was established, only the primary school in the village remained.</seg>
<seg id="24">To avoid a demotion in the now smaller school, moved to Karlsfeld - former Rector Georg Sigl and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Petershausen grew, and as the children and their teachers from September 1982 could relate the present building, which was expanded in 1997 to judge retirement.</seg>

<seg id="28">In his whole career Manfred Richter has never forget the speech of a Government representative, who had responded to a Department of education about law and justice: "We must never forget the love". Manfred Richter translated what he had heard as a young teacher there.</seg>
<seg id="29">"You have the children two things to give with: roots and wings", the today he says.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to learn: "Do not always". It is not entirely clear whether he thinks only his students or just his own six children.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, judge Tun was sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If students beat up, they got not a punitive labor by him and also were not fined for detention.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of the municipality, had judge let two get some boxing gloves and had to compete against the two opponents, even though it should give a violet in.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the sake of the school, judge maintained a good relationship with the former Mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as Rector.</seg>
<seg id="35">This moved the result Richter after retirement to do so, to run in 1996 as last on the CSU list for the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="36">But judge was selected to place six and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC has found the great Director, it needs.</seg>
<seg id="2">She arrives with a proud glory train from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own front experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and co., which moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world by Pearsons.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was Chairman of the financial times for seven years and stepped down as the top item of the parent company of Pearson to a younger male colleague went.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their settlement was reportedly nearly 1 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also her political ranking is solid.</seg>
<seg id="8">She was recommended David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former Chairman of BP, when it was looking for more private-sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became the Counselor of the Cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband is a former Tory Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">In may, I described the purpose of the Chair with a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only is the BBC as a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Trust works in two directions: to the inside on the first guard of its management hierarchy at the BBC, but outward as the voice public concern and unrest, when things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ensures an almost unsustainable duopoly, which calls for a full comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But what new incoming President would risk to compete, to embark on everything and to take apart an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he himself perhaps brings to his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if this were not enough, are also still many interested is reduced to see BBC -, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While closer to the competition and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, it is connected to the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC with special hazards.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145.50 per year and buys up the British public in the certainly largest media company in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: she says that she reached 96 percent of all households and only 40 pence per day costs each of them.</seg>
<seg id="20">And apparently the BBC goes on the popularity scale back upwards: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The vision and habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines today on my cell phone and catch missed programs later on my iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a very beloved and respectable institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">She needs a considerable Chairman - I hope she has found him.</seg>

<seg id="2">One of the most prominent contractors of London pointed out that the housing market in the South East of England "was returned to normal levels".</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital were in hot demand and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England due to the widespread fear of a credit bubble that, to put limits on mortgage loans in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and Chief Executive Officer of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "Since the beginning of the current financial year the market has returned 2013 at normal levels of transaction since the peak" and added that this offers a "robust action"environment.</seg>
<seg id="5">The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn, as foreign buyers in the capital urged.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information of the cadastre office prices in the metropolitan area are skyrocketed in the past year alone to 18.5 percent, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling prices for Berkeley's student, private and reasonably priced offers rose by a fifth in the last year and were at the end of April at the 423,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="8">A stronger pound has, however, made less attractive in recent months real estate property in London for foreign buyers - some of them are been deterred also by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric to a possible "Villensteuer" before the general elections next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London real estate agent of Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, the tighter credit lending rules were introduced in the second half of the year to lower market growth both in the sale of real estate prices would lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">New data of the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in the mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the real estate market cools.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions international, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the growth of real estate prices in London for 2015 after down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already weak house price consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Kensington, Chelsea and Mayfair has now declined every year a quarter so the estate agent WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the desire for a home in the city of Berkeley is a blessing, since the amounts for forward sales to more than 2.2 billion £ amounts.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "demand remained stable after the proper, well-planned product at the best locations and also the forward sales have remained stable as a result."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it 3,742 new homes - sold in the year until end of April almost one-third more than the peak 2007 before the crisis.</seg>
<seg id="16">Annual profit before tax grew annually by 40 percent to 280 million £, sales rose 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.</seg>
<seg id="17">In a release on Monday before the annual general meeting of the company, Mr Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley would expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The analysts estimate consistent annual pre-tax profit to 450 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter "J".</seg>
<seg id="2">They have vanished, so one could best describe it, they dissolved slowly like a cardboard, which you left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Occasionally, a woman told him he was too seriously, exhausting, intense, aloof and perhaps a little Crabby.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then shook his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">Crabby he knew.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was prickly, as in hedgehogs, Yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this Prickliness was a just starting affair, which had been promising for a relief of the lonely boredom in his life than usual, and maybe even a certain satisfaction brought him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solomons was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rugged as a port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came accompanied by an older South, who thought her aunt Kevern and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but Paradise Valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">Over several years, no one had lived in the House.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were leaking, the bathrooms were still spinning, slugs had left its mark on all Windows and believed it belonged to them, and the garden was overgrown with weeds, looked like huge cabbages.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was a garden full of secrets as the House in a children's fairy tale, both threatening how tempting.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the long list for the 2014 standing Booker Prize.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern had sat with Ailinn händchenhaltend on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had been hooked absent-mindedly in the Services console, which supplied the country with soothing music and calming messages, as the sight of her crossed legs of Brown a long-forgotten black entertainer reminded him of an old song, which his father had listened to like with closed shutters in the home.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too large.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to their very own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not prohibited - there was nothing really illegal - not just played.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was successfully obsolesziert, like the Word whether sole zieren.</seg>
<seg id="20">The General taste, managed what decrees and regulations would have done, and like the folks at books which of the rags-to select memoirs of the millionaire, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads with the music.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and to sing big feet in a coarse comic Serenade Ailinns.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn did not understand that.</seg>
<seg id="23">"That was a famous song of a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, and put two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between him and his father, when he was a kid.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, so he was told.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you're starting a Word with a J, without two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was already not a very fun game, and it was also not very funny.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that this was expected of him, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what was jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn have never had what belongs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was not played even though he was not directly forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvisation was no longer modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only room for one "If" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody, where it would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Just as the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was mind expressed in musical.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he had become 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he had to Ailinn explain that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At their age she could not remember probably at a time, where pop singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again was that no laws or constraints.</seg>
<seg id="43">A conforming society meant that each element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of talent of the Group--grateful as spared by fate.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of afro Caribbean origin were suitable temperament and physique for entertainment and sport, so sang and ran it.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent, and were blessed as by nature with an electronic talent looked after with the task to make sure that no family without working service phone remained.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community, cared for the sewage system; What was left of the Greeks, he smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents had not quickly leave the country when what was happening, if it was done geschah-fearing to be accused of fear even, due to fire sakura_linhmc that the flames would - eat it next Labneh - and shisha pipes restaurants had opened, were given and were depressed with the inactivity.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because she had heard only ballads, it was difficult Ailinn to understand how ever could be set to music the offensive words which just had sung before Kevern you.</seg>
<seg id="50">Expression of love was music.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except perhaps for people whose Füße are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He was talking too much, but the neglected garden gave him a deceptive feeling of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn's still didn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father something should love?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but hesitated to place two fingers on the lips in front of her.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought that he was somewhat odd.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It appeared it funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Keverns perspective.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing else around the world consider their ungekämmtes Raven black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing that he would want to see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," they mean without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you sing to it me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed honestly concerned.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked once again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet not so directly.</seg>
<seg id="70">Maybe your ankle a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is just the stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said "I love you", but it was still too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your fat ankles are exactly the reason why I like you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm a little Kinky.</seg>
<seg id="78">That sounded not right.</seg>
<seg id="79">It had to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">If he was trying to be funny, he brought up often in trouble, because he did not like his father have the soothing charm, you needed to bear the cruelty inherent in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Perhaps, his father wanted to be too cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his friendly eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons was red and rose from her deck chair, knocked over the console and spilled the wine she had drunk.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderberry blossom wine, so, drunkenness was no excuse for it.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her excitement, she seemed to shiver, like Palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your is exactly the reason why I'm perverse feeling attracted to you," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except, that's not me.</seg>
<seg id="89">She felt sorry him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words such as fear, which was evident in their eyes, when she rebelled against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he would beat her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him from life on the cold northern archipelago, where she had grown up, but he had no doubts that it was essentially like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke here and there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after what was happening as it had been their ancestors as a smuggler and wrecker, moved from pub to pub, getting ready to raise the hand against a woman who is denied them or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fathead?</seg>
<seg id="95">You showed a thick fist her, if she wasn't on!</seg>
<seg id="96">They first Snog - smooching was the most commonly used Word for an erotic attraction between men and women, they only make out an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - and then beat.</seg>
<seg id="97">Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement as the smooch was itself an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from a deck chair as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt also leaden, but the force of his mourning surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">You hardly knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him, how he removed - so how from a room on the top floor of their attendant watched him - a man, weighed down by something that he himself had conjured up.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam left the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for him and men in General, although some had raised their hands against them.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why it was a sight she seemed to know well if she but not could remember at once, when she had seen something before this day?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, Solomon's Ailinn looked at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Several years before the incidents just told Esme Nussbaum worked, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, in a short speech about the continuation of violence on low and medium level in precisely the parts of the country, where their reduction, if not elimination, on the likely will have been expected, considering the funds and energy , which had been invested in the eradication of this violence.</seg>
<seg id="109">"Much has been done, and much still needs to be done," she wrote "in order to appease the inborn aggressiveness of a people that has fought a thousand wars and won most of them, particularly in the secluded corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness was felt historically despite the soaring bell towers between the hedges rare.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some properties prove ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the Tower, it seems, the lower the passion that he still wakes.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population is crying drunk while listening to sentimental ballads, stories about overcome difficulties and claimed to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life yet not only the former rawness captures the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious contentiousness at home , at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," said her mentor, as he had read the entire report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask: you are an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think I don't have to tell," Esme Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again, Esme relied on their right to privacy, and denial of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I do not ask that" said Luther Rabinowitz eventually, "because I would be against lesbianism, atheism and feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is an unprejudiced workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve an unprejudiced society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of hypersensitivity, which is itself absolutely acceptable and laudable, can occasionally have presented her results as you distort.</seg>
<seg id="126">You own prejudice against the Church, and those things that refer to you as "sneaky" and "raw", have obviously could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural force and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you continue riding around on the, what happened, when it happened, like it, if it would have happened yesterday happened, means to take his essential life force to the country.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head, LED lettering in Flamingo Pink repeated the advice in the last quarter of a century or longer Ofnow had given the country.</seg>
<seg id="130">You smile at their neighbors, they appreciate their partner, listening ballads, visit musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen to, agree to, excuse himself.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence, the Sung Word is better than what is written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I absolutely understand what you want," answered with a calm voice, as she was sure that it had spoken to her supervisor to end Esme Nussbaum, "and I say nothing more than that we are still not so effectively cured, how we fool ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern lies in the fact that we find ourselves without warning may be doing as we repeat the mistakes that what happened to the first place, if it is happening led.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time but it is not the other, where we leave out our anger and our mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">To indicate that the patience of a Saint.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "If you call actions as a"Mistake", which may or may not have committed our grandparents.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far when you say that they had set out their "anger" and their "mistrust" to "other".</seg>
<seg id="139">It should actually not be necessary, someone in your position to remind that we speak in understanding the past as in the present protection of "us" and "other".</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "other".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"Which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what's done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">It was at that time.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing more need be said - because we are in agreement.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just like no blame to be assigned to must, so also no debt must be blotted out, if a such repayment would be appropriate, and if there was a way to wipe them off.</seg>
<seg id="148">But to what serves the past, if we do not learn</seg>
<seg id="149">The past serves, we forget about them.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can say something</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramid coincide.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll consider their report," he said and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcycle rider, passers-by described, was driven in a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.</seg>

<seg id="1">Production in the euro zone to a 13-month low</seg>
<seg id="2">The increase in the production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely watched study with.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit purchasing managers index of manufacturing (PMI) fell in August to 50.7, according to a State of 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">An indication of 50 indicates an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia via the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro zone, as well as for the impending deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3% from the Bank.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, in the course of this week further information could make, if he pulls a quantitative easing for the euro area into account, according to those who have been made by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the braking effects of the increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties for manufacturers were clear," said Rob Dobson, Senior Economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, the biggest trading partner of Russia in the EU fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the PMI on 46.9 fell in the second largest economy of the bloc, France.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a concern, such as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Evidence that incentives for growth in the key industrial mechanism in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands no longer have access, are also not reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The decline in the industry probably fuels the fire of the analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, Chief Economist at IHS global insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone by August, is that after the sector continues to grow."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "manufacturers in the eurozone find life currently obviously quite difficult because the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially in Russia and the Ukraine - increase uncertainties in the ongoing difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and causes probably that some orders are delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that there would be "increasingly likely" that the ECB finally must initiate a kind of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="7">The tragedy brought together East and West in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the middle of the worst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years later we returned to Beslan, some finding the victim who escaped death when the atrocity in the classroom.</seg>

<seg id="37">It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">As a seven, he said: "Mama told me I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion, he thought she would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She said to him: "Run."</seg>
<seg id="41">Full of fear, she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father Vladimir, who closed his son out into the arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I could not save her."</seg>
<seg id="44">In reality was out there tripped Tamara after and with leg injuries in the hospital, for its part in the assumption that her son had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.</seg>

<seg id="53">"I'm not scared, to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these children, with whom I played in the yard, and that it not out there have done.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they have been killed or are dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they have been in the Sports Hall.</seg>

<seg id="58">But now he's afraid to spot such as the Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.</seg>
<seg id="61">I'm so happy to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to go to the police one day and hope they will take me next year at the Training Academy.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call in and running around, and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">The people in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">At that time, I understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful for the price and the ability to travel to London in the autumn of 2004 Cherie Blair and her Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and you yourself say that 10 years have passed, but I still at the meeting her and her husband in London remember me, and how the Damir and me has helped.</seg>
<seg id="70">I still remember how Damir wanted to like to eat Borscht and they called all local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot with his water gun at them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was just one month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world has not improved in these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">In the Ukraine, the war goes on now, and every day people die, and I think that many children have been and still are killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are just such children like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many the war is a part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know what these people feel the whole horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can not stop to feel that.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, the people want to kill each other always and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was great and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">For example he does not search for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past horrors.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he remembers not like it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was small, he suffered - I remember, how he sometimes lay on the sofa, the face turned away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not asleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is greater than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy now 17.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that I for a few hours so was sure that he was dead and I would see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">I myself recovering after the explosion and came on the legs, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with all surrounding parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could possibly have survived.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember, I cried to him,"Damir, run, run", but I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it, and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so life goes differently than that of many others, for us.</seg>

<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>

<seg id="105">No one will ever forget that, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Urgently: The image of George (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has been as immortalized statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that George wanted to like go to school that day. He said he wanted to hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only knew that he was alive, when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there's even this statue of George weeping in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to see the picture, and it is hidden in the Bookshelf with us at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world thanks to this picture feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says today: "it is important that as something never can happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what has caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is something terrible.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so what happens?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to it's a small little forgetting.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I had a few nightmares due to the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in the year 2004 and was scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who were slain.</seg>
<seg id="125">Therefore, I'm always in the gym, when closer to the 1 September.</seg>
<seg id="126">I should say my old childhood friends tribute.</seg>
<seg id="127">It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I don't feel victimized, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I don't feel sorry for me.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>

<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not permit that.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgij Fanijew, 20</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, though he was caught at the foot of a murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was trapped during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="140">It truly is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it, as if it were yesterday," says George, who as intelligence officer to the FSB wanted to go, but could not do this because of his health problems due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"in 2006 I worked with psychologists and felt then actually slightly better, but I can't it not forget."</seg>
<seg id="145">And I'd like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - in the year after that - was the first and only time, I went back to the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never again go back and not ask me please to show you where I have been sitting in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I think don't like it or talk about it, and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically I'm fine.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful about my injured knee, but I can run right now.</seg>
<seg id="154">But due to my health I could not study at the secret service Academy of the FSB in St. Petersburg, how I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I've submitted my documents, the medical and she responded that it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">The animals were my second passion, so I went to the Veterinary Institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have already two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats up to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should know anything about that, and they should not suffer of course also it.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "this sorrow leave me never.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is worse in my soul, if closer to the anniversary.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations commemorating.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George will not go down.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be heavy still much for him, because he was there and I didn't.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was at home waiting on him and couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful that he returned me God. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George is now an adult, but this horror is still in it.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept that something so unfair happens to one.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can not take part due to his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several times, he can run, but not sports.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="174">This horrible experience will always haunt us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and that reinforced only my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I've lost many people that I know well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift God could make me, but my heart cries for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know born of families, in which new children, but also of widows who have never remarried.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if they don't want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how my heart in me jumped when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I see, what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What fight these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I almost can't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure that in the Ukraine, many children have been killed and many are killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we all could - access these rebels and throw out as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="190">Saved: Alyona Tskajewa is brought by a Russian special forces in security (left).</seg>
<seg id="191">It is now ten (right) and even doesn't remember the atrocities</seg>
<seg id="192">The World 2004 held the breath, as the baby eat in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan was carried.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists let them go, but held back in their cruelty her 30 year-old mother, 10-year sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for about $300 to have.</seg>
<seg id="4">I this photos at a family feast with multiple cameras recorded, all that at a price of under $350 are available.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Inspect your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to record.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and shooting modes, which optimizes the exposure for the gloomy underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, make sure your equipment is functional in what depth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are approved only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search in our buyer's Guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple pictures - because many will not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point and shoot cameras do not have action cams a LCD, with which you can compose images, usually.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right image is a matter of luck.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you make a lot of shots.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a series mode, with the made a series of recordings with slightly different exposure settings, you use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Remain close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light is dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible stay so close to the surface, if you shoot in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, you can bring more color in your photos. the deeper you go, you will see the less color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Close approach to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is good advice even on land, but he is all the more important because of the poor light conditions under water.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is particularly important, if you are working with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need closer to your objects used when they should fill out the entire picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose Charakter changed things, even in a so gigantic organization like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As consultant physician of the anesthesia he dedicated his career, to save both the agony of the disease and also the torment of treating the sick.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, his wife, recalls was a MI6 employee who had to live with the ravages of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important doctors, while the treated are mostly busy with something quite other: pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in the year 2007 he was the one, whose ordeal began however.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I've not felt," he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to pick me up.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he eagerly reproached his wife Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want it all better now than later", he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Was as Juliet for a week on a business trip, felt quite unusually Lawson and worried for no reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to make an X-ray of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks ago, he had been in the French Alps for skiing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the X-ray existed.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from Mesothelioma, an incurable cancer, which attacks the pleura, so the skin pulled over the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually hard to determine.</seg>
<seg id="17">While, for example, some smokers will develop lung cancer, not all Lungenkrebserkrankten of former smokers have been.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos - contact with the fiber materials, which once was considered as "Miracle material" but now was considered fatal.</seg>
<seg id="20">Mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore how easy for most of us.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos no longer used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry committed voluntarily to stop using it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even in places where it was still used, only people in certain industries directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example worked.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial hazardous material from another time, he seems to be today hardly any cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="25">But that complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">United Kingdom, it seems, experienced today the culmination of an Mesoltheliom epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from Mesothelioma here than in any other country of the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of the disease than in traffic accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">Annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we now experience the deadly impact, although asbestos is illegal (1999, all types of asbestos have been banned) for years, is that a Mesothelioma develops only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of the mesothelioma is limited not on former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and often still is in the houses present in which we live, offices, where we work, the schools where we learn and shops, where we buy a.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions, or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions, the elegant department stores in London up to private schools, are not a shelter.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament buildings are asbestos-contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also in hospitals, where we are still healthy, have been made as a source herd of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was also a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was difficult in fact him, to imagine where he could have come with asbestos in contact.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if in the tunnels to the guy it a lot of asbestos of hospital, where I completed my education for six years, was present." he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All students, nurses, doctors and Porter - use the tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many will suffer my peers the same illness?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately at least partially, he could answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, hospital have been trained on the guy, and who became ill in the last five years on mesothelioma", 2010, he wrote in a letter, "am I the last one which is still alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us are still developing?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma in the age of 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long survival time.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease ends always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can repeat only Lawson's question: "how many of us will still get sick?"</seg>
<seg id="53">The leading expert of Britain to mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and by 2050, if the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to a standstill, total 90,000 are have fallen victim of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them have have no idea that they are going to die so at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the dishes to those affected often have recourse due to claims for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June of this year marks & Spencer admitted, for example, have exposed Janice of all negligent erweise asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years for the chain, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible of the clothing Department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Their activity with M was only 18 years, as it & S began.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now, she has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this thing," she says, "I never heard of mesothelioma, I still don't even really knew anything about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that that would even affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are only few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the term asbestos refers not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure, which makes the material strong and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, also known as the white asbestos is the by far most often today found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, is considered "great risk" with possible resulting in death but nevertheless by the EU and the WHO.</seg>
<seg id="70">However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocidolite) is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "significant, but indirect evidence there, that this was a main reason for the unique high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to Alamy in the flagship store in Oxford Street, London, asbestos</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice has not considered himself perhaps all typical Mesotheliomopfer, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those affected, which shows, that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure probably was caused by work or in the home by asbestos contact in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">His statement after a majority of these contacts is based on "normal use of aging" our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks like no one could assume, to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard consulting, which studied the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the Government, unknowingly the fabric exposed have been could.</seg>
<seg id="78">2009 Goddard reported that the service ducts and pipes behind the Committee rooms of the Parliament with asbestos were contaminated, whose deadly Fasern could be stirred up by something as harmless as "strong air movements".</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of Parliament are accused of often to worry about their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite would apply to.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Directorate of parliamentary work it was, that the Westminsterpalast had received a "clean health certificate", it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ effort over several years to be applied to renovate the Parliament, to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos and that after the general elections by 2015 members likely meet in the nearby QE2 Conference Centre are considered on the Green benches in Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report also pointed out, that "the presence was handled by asbestos not according to the respective regulations."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who could never pinpoint the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the 50-year Abbott suspected that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was in a hospital worked, in the asbestos lawsuits were decided positively", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember where you worked, and on the data for all places.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he clearly remembers is the day in early December 2009, where he got some kind of fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and conducted an operation just late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly, I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came all of a sudden.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt horrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I felt no longer to make the journey home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain resulting from the pleura, the skin around his lungs around.</seg>
<seg id="95">But as Janice all he had no reason to suspect a Mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He went a month not to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Astonished doctors took x-rays of his chest and set Pleurakathether to remove fluid from the lungs and to test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health improved slowly, and he returned to his job.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time but the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">in 2011, came an Abbott's patient with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But now Abbott not combined this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">Finally, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in the case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt sick for the first time, introduced a probe equipped with a camera into the cavity between the ribs and the pleura.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I'm moving on mostly easy,"he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">Frankly, I was worried not so many.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">Was the result of the biopsy in the week between Christmas and new year's day: "You told me that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnosis mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, of which one advised him to hire a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now, he realized the magnitude of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was very widespread, particularly in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, developing now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so, mesothelioma is now younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were exposed to probably rather not the fabric.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who changed (such as Andrew Lawson) in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another or (as it often did Graham Abbott), ate in underground canteens were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It is evident, that for several decades after the war, hospitals for the patients were potentially life-saving, but life-threatening for the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still removed.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students turned off her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it concerns not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Due to its fabulous insulating and fire-retardant properties, asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Also schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">Actually, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Everywhere in the country, thousands of hours of chemistry, students have parked in her Bunsen burner on asbestos mat.</seg>
<seg id="128">The issue of asbestos in schools is now often spoken on Web pages.</seg>
<seg id="129">And meanwhile, as innocent items in our homes as flooring panels or shed roofs have by default contain asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison, that is included in large parts of our real estate," Andrew Morgan, the lawyer, noticed the Andrew Lawson it hospital took in his lawsuit against guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact that occurred to a concerned woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So beware how you tear off your garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to move, but I realized that I could concentrate on that, which I did.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was two weeks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I had to go and take care of me to myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will experience no more Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">The change of perspective from the position of a physician to a patient was with the greatest difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information, which he had to cope with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very hard to take it all," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor,"how long do I have?""</seg>
<seg id="143">And they gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "well, I will experience no more Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">It was then."</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life preservation mechanism - even - breathing, that caused the deadly cancer.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos contact.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is stirred up, and the fibers are inhaled, they can become lodged in the pleura, lungs, skin.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem arises with needlelike asbestos fibres inhaled," so Professor Tom Treasure, a heart chest physician, who in 2001, hospital transferred it to the guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">Just the hospital, by the Andrew Lawson believed that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and dealt with some others that also probably were exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">As soon as the asbestos needles can reach the lung tissue, says treasure, "pressed by the breathing process at the edge, where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">By nature, it is invasive from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options in other cancers not work as well in mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of an operation is as hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it was worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denied that.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can not cut out the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You get around with a knife, not a question.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer "on chemotherapy not reacts to very easily," which "has effect", but does not heal.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long term survivors," says treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But they all die at the end.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients live in fact long, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after his own diagnosis still struggling Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came four years in contact with Andrew Lawson, after his diagnosis a man support- and became a consulting Office for fellow sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Cancer Center," he imagined himself cheerfully calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis of 4 years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and extend his life expected to be only about a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson made it however "to appear the things in a somewhat positive light."</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors, Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic long Lazdunski, decided it to continue cardiac-thoracic specialist on the guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage by the fact that I not be had referred, I just called and got an appointment," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would need to receive a wire transfer and must wait for the approval of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is critical for people with mesothelioma, to be eligible for the best available therapies.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if these treatments fail eventually, inevitably, many of those affected by an other financial concerns - about the future of the families who left them.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what is changing in the 1960s, that it was recognized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And the negligence of the company to play a role started here.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy it hospital put aside their case after all, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation", as Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma an asbestos contact to the guy it was.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the examination to his death a spokesman of the guy confirmed it but that "the asbestos fibers in the affected area of the cellar in the 1990s have been removed."</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">It is actually for mesothelioma ill, seeking compensation, a huge problem, the deadly asbestos contact to assign a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employer have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents may be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who defend themselves against claims, know that the time for her, but isn't quite sure with the plaintiffs.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response there were significant new legislation that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers this year to seek compensation, even if their former employer to find no longer are.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has a Fund of 350 million funded by the insurance industry £ for all established after July 2012 were diagnosed, can prove a contact, who can sue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiff will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process them would be able to speak to about 120,000 pounds.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma sufferers, that 350 million £ represented a "very good job" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," says he, and indicates if this amount to one-fourth of that what insurers would have to pay, if the time it would have gone away and was diagnosed with mesothelioma find the companies and normally could sue them.</seg>
<seg id="200">Also Mike Penning, of work and pension Minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect".</seg>
<seg id="201">But both admitted penning such as Morgan, that given by seven deaths a day a quick action was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people suffer so much and now need help," Paez said in December of last year during the second hearing of the mesothelioma law.</seg>
<seg id="203">At this point, Graham Abbott was 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic long Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their initial discussions, long Lazdunski recommended an operation, which he expected a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was accompanied by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with the long Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is of course with the most important," Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see that time and again in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">It's something that can make you more.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you give up, you're very rapidly worse.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent surgery March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">End of August he had the last the six cycles of chemotherapy behind.</seg>
<seg id="213">Nachsorgescans showed no signs of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were more cancer spots around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">That is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is life-ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="220">No sign of tumors is now more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="222">You must be thinking to practical things - about the money, if I am not, for example, or my wife show how the water heater setting.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"For parents, this is hard," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease, I would be not old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They responded quite differently.</seg>

<seg id="1">China denies Hong Kong right to choice of Government, demonstrators sworn vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday the Chinese Parliament despite of the increased calls decided after democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the elections 2017 by the electorate of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably fired the long announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists to led the planning and mobilization within a few hours after the announcement in the way.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese people's Congress generally allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is not unexpected, but it makes us yet angry," legal expert Emily said LAU, Chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">That's not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">You lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we have to do it with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of the Chinese decision said Li Fei, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the national of people's Congress, that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be to "messy".</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Great Britain control over Hong Kong back the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the inhabitants from 2017 choose chaired Government.</seg>
<seg id="11">China's leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakthrough, because there is a direct right to vote to citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes it clear, that the Chinese leadership retains the flow through a Nominating Committee controlled closely by Beijing firmly in hand.</seg>
<seg id="12">To allow only candidates "with love for the country and love Hong Kong" after a new clause.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and due protests in Hong Kong were held for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement stands occupy Central with love and peace, whose Organisatoren have threatened to seal off the financial district, if Beijing allows no real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, hundreds of occupy Central trailers in the rain in front of the Government Headquarters in Hong Kong had gathered within hours of the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and protest waves, they planned in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">You made this apparently to avoid problems with the authorities, but no further details.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online message informed the organizers that the movement "the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort drew, an action that should only take place if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sorry to have to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have prepared for days to Beijing's announcement, and there were stricter security measures including police and barricades on Sunday in front of the Government building.</seg>
<seg id="21">The riots are reinforced by the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that they slowly lose control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the Mainland increased the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, the fear that the values begin to erode Hong Kong as democracy and freedom of speech under growing pressure from Beijing is growing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticized the demonstrations of the occupy Central movement, because it threatens the business - the lifeline of Hong Kong -.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, of which they speak, could cause major economic damage, depending on how many are involved in and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who criticized the movement for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="26">We want to incite any fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's State-controlled media also recently reported the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum to the discretions which 780,000 people attended - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the history of the region took part.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticize race question and police behaviour after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson mo. killed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands in the air and sang "Hands high, don't shoot", while they waited for the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two-week protests in Ferguson, MO, due to the shooting of the unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to speak right of reproduction, and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">While tensions in the Midwest but rose, and received attention across the country, Perez saw that the responses of white women turned to 100% to the breed.</seg>
<seg id="7">The personal essays with titles like "Thoughts on Ferguson by a white woman" and "Feminism is not just about the oppression of women" came relatively late compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shooting down of 9 August.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, that meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I don't think that one finds many people in feminism, be about the white and privileges so high-class way to speak," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The people felt constrained to express something to the incidents to.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized, that they need to express.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English Professor Koritha Mitchell of the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought problems to light, black Americans are exposed to every day, but not considered "Women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can post something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something about how Blacks are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How it can be safe for women to not speak, but security in public spaces in public about a relationship?" she asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender, and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them, black women have had the luxury, clean to separate the topics; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now connect the topics of race and gender in the feminist Mainstreamkreisen, Angela Hattery, Professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"At least 10,000 black men were lynched between 1865 and 1890 and the reasoning was almost always the rape of a white woman," said hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery came the division between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women's suffrage as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late years of the 19th century and noted that the fight for the right to vote only for a group of each could be successful: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Made a decision to put women's suffrage, and the right to vote for black should come later," said hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">If you remember such things, one realises one with power, why women of color do not trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have done our job not well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have helped never black women, to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women received the right to vote in 1920, it took even a decade for organized themselves to white women against the lynching in the Association of southern woman for the prevention of lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mitchell is the flood of white feminist responses to by Ferguson that black women apart contact questions raised - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the time in which white feminists played "Catch" with problems, for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It not great if the right to education of a child, the activists, the platforms feminist about such traditional have to take seriously what they do with the right to birth control?" asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists of the second generation, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraceptive means, try to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and a pointed articles by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the guardian, in which it demands more protests by white Americans on the topic of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about the breed, which are distinctly different in public polls--will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism, addressed in the racial as well as gender issues, are some of their comments on the subject of race in America, but baffled.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina summer, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "who stole feminism?" compared to she the people said that young men in the United States, in particular young coloured men, "are far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinems comments to Ferguson stand in contrast to their earlier criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys now.</seg>
<seg id="36">But as the White House recently a small program, my brother keeper, put it on, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were angry reactions by many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is pushing to the fore of the Mainstreamfeminismus.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the US border police has picked up almost 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the southwestern border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform has re-emerged on the surface - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co Chairman of we belong together, mobilized an organization, women for immigration reform, said that for a revisiting of the issue as an important women's issue she must publish only the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of male immigrants work visas, are the women who support them in a position where they are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find a finish in the women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not only the gladiators were ankle-deep in the mud at the Rheinbach Roman day at the amusement park.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the attraction of the event was to attract strong enough, yesterday much more than 1000 visitors who braved the rain and cold autumn and completely inspired by the historical spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a colorful bounty of presentations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">Main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force of the Gladiator school "Amor mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gladiator owner "Leonidas" turned out to be humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men in a heroic duel in different types of Gladiator ring at a time.</seg>
<seg id="7">First were the "Provocatoren" on the series with rectangle shield, short sword and Greaves on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">It followed the "Essedarii" with breast shield, short sword and throwing Lance as well as iron Gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.</seg>
<seg id="9">The appearance of the "Retiarius", which joined with throwing NET, Trident and dagger against the 'Secutor' and after a short battle pushed the guy to the ground was particularly impressive.</seg>
<seg id="10">Since the swords crashed metallic together, schepperten shields and the throw Spears flew zooming through the arena that could be anxious one to the health of the Gladiators.</seg>
<seg id="11">But that had the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, an always attentive eye.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to the Roman everyday life revive and experience the culture of the Roman Empire," said Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer of "Circle of friends, Romans channel", the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation, a "Roman oppidum", a Roman town, was from the theme park for a day as Vice-Mayor Claus Walker package discovered in his greeting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally the Romans brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire.</seg>
<seg id="15">Remnants of it were to marvel at, about "aqueduct marble" from the 1400 metre and eleven-metre-high Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at German also in the Roman day.</seg>
<seg id="16">Frontinus society faced once and now the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We benefit today from the knowledge of that time".</seg>
<seg id="17">This is confirmed also surveying engineer Ralph of Saint of the "IngenieurteamZwei" of Rheinbach, which the Romans as Chorobat, Groma or dioptra presented surveying instruments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 and bricks from the original-Hypokauste, hot-air heating, that once warmed the Roman villa.</seg>
<seg id="19">Impressive also the footprints, which had been left behind by Wolf and Fox two millennia ago in the kicks out of clay, before you burned them.</seg>
<seg id="20">2011, the Office for soil conservation at the Landesverband Rheinland the remains of a Roman villa in the Industrial Park had dug North in Rheinbach, Germany.</seg>
<seg id="21">You found enclosing walls of a building with a kiln for drying grain and malting.</seg>
<seg id="22">A Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, probably heard the building, said the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.</seg>
<seg id="23">A number of artefacts from the excavations in a glass display case was introduced, including a large dish, several fine glassware, as well as parts of a delicate necklace.</seg>

<seg id="7">State taxes rose more than the local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for state taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenues of the district, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia scored the lowest tax revenues from companies with 28 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">A large part of the increase in revenue is due to a recovery of the real estate assets of the companies, say the researchers, which led to an increase of in real estate taxes 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large part of these gains came from large States like California, New York and Texas, the procedure also for the Washington area seems to apply.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the district, Maryland and Virginia together over 10 billion paid $ on State and local real estate taxes last year, compared with 9.6 billion $2012 - an increase in the course of one year by 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in improving State and local tax revenue in Maryland, because here the real estate taxes on slightly more than one-fifth of the tax assessment notices from companies amounted to.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their State and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland, the following occurs: a large part of real estate, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the Government or by non-profits, that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely to provide the same services that offer other States, for example, much more on income taxes.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in the tax revenue from companies can be expected to not only the recovery of the real estate market</seg>
<seg id="18">Corporate earnings seem also to recover the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported income taxes for State organizations of 2.3 billion $ compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took 1 billion $ a in corporate income tax, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden on companies in all three places rises evenly.</seg>
<seg id="22">The increase rate in the district was with 4.3 percent national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue by 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax with 6 percent in all three areas of the Office (in all three, there are fixed corporate tax rate).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate in Maryland is relatively high 9,975 percent at 8.25 percent and in the district.</seg>
<seg id="26">A comparable study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia require less State and local business taxes and overall a better tax climate than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The district was not examined in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina has adopted the same set as Virginia laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, and the rate will fall next year to 5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the State still achieves its goals of income in the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of the State until 2017 at 3%.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems better to go the small businesses in the Washington area, and they pay so more State and local taxes, according to the latest study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes that is paid in personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transition structure, according to the most small businesses are organized - in the district, Maryland and Virginia rose last year by 20 percent to 2.4 billion $ at a significantly faster growth rate than the corporate taxes overall.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country probably will stop in this year, with an increase in the General more military tax revenue for the State and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the Washington area could lag behind when the spending of the Federal Government affects the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou</seg>
<seg id="2">Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.</seg>
<seg id="3">German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.</seg>
<seg id="4">Frankfurt's sister city in China now wants a brewery and hopes also on a direct flight connection between the two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's sister city, Guangzhou - so is the urgent desire of the official in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would be happy, if a German brewery would settle down in our city", the Deputy Party Secretary said the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei this week when visiting an SPD delegation in his town.</seg>
<seg id="7">The functionary of the ruling Communist Party of China in the course of conversation on this concern repeatedly returned the metropolis of 12 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">Guangzhou, which is also called Canton in Germany, was one of the richest cities in China, promoted Li.</seg>
<seg id="9">Therefore, the people have also the purchasing power to make German beer.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Hessian SPD Chairman Thorsten Saeed, who led the German delegation of politicians, said the host, he'll ask around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It not much need for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre", he added during the lunch with the Parteioberen in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mr. Li already transmit this joy of life, he flattered the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Then the official from Guangzhou nudged with Saeed - however with red wine which was served for dinner.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.</seg>
<seg id="16">More business traffic</seg>
<seg id="17">A second request of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flights between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Deputy party chief Li.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be worth again", the politician was convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The commerce between our two cities continues to".</seg>
<seg id="21">Currently travellers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.</seg>
<seg id="22">Also the administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, hoping the flight connection.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Vice Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, turned this desire in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This is a very good idea", said Saeed - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate knowledge of Germany, nodded.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well maintained partnership</seg>
<seg id="26">The affable Vice Party Chief of Guangzhou is hoping that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.</seg>
<seg id="27">Li Yiwei was already on the main, but not yet in this function.</seg>
<seg id="28">He was originally in the Office this year after his predecessor out of Office on corruption charges had been promoted.</seg>
<seg id="29">The local Party Chief Wan Qinglian had to go.</seg>
<seg id="30">The action against the officials from Guangzhou is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is enforced by leader Xi Jinping with hardness.</seg>
<seg id="31">The new leaders of Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Communist Party of China.</seg>
<seg id="32">Before taking office in Guangzhou he worked as official in Fujian, where the carmaker VW built a large factory.</seg>
<seg id="33">Frankfurt has officially more than a dozen town-twinning.</seg>
<seg id="34">The connection to the 9000 km from Guangzhou is among those that are maintained by both sides, with a student exchange.</seg>
<seg id="35">The 25-year anniversary of the german Chinese connection was celebrated last year.</seg>
<seg id="36">The South China city on the Pearl River is almost as strong as Hesse with its economic power.</seg>
<seg id="37">She wants to achieve a GDP of 250 billion euros next year, reported Li.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys twitch for 1.04 billion $</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON has just confirmed what had reported information on Monday morning: online retailers - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the Videostreamingdienst twitch for 1.04 billion $ (970 million US$).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody had expected a takeover by twitch, but because it has been widely suggested that YouTube would acquire the company.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as the sale of twitch to the video service from Google for a cool billion done deal, and the cooperation appeared too of course.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded only three years ago when Justin.tv was started as a common streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead it quickly became a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces in games published a "YouTube for live games", as an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let it play", a genre of video in the know-it-all to a painting by secret science Theatre the (mostly older) games are already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is just so that YouTube often called somewhat bored, if one wants to describe twitch, so the news that YouTube twitch wanted to buy, was recorded, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube came because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we know at the moment about it, is this statement by Emmet shear, President of twitch: "We have for Amazon decided, because they believe in our community, they share our values and our long-term visions and they want to help us to get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret to the incredible success of twitch is, frankly.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me, explaining that they prefer sports as watching, it is hard to understand the attraction that goes to watch others playing rather than take even the control console in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to watch a friend while she sneaks through resident evil, and something else, is shot at 3 in the morning over the shoulder to watch a spinner it like 20 times consecutively in the call of duty in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">You could see all these games right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so the watch without their own control over the perspective of views can be a really good recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the quick passes to the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But as long as it is not a game - or humor virtuoso, his twitch channel is probably not so very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But skeptics like I already know what?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic peaks.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly will Amazon make money from it?</seg>
<seg id="22">It's hard to imagine that twitch is so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant video as YouTube twitch would have to swallow easily.</seg>
<seg id="23">But twitch has what any company would like: thousands of young men who are being wooed as advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the Chairman of twitch, shear, said Amazon and twitch "believe both on the future of gaming", and the media doesn't even - shows no signs of shrinking, swallow - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the bouncy castle at the Castle Garden Festival, a lot was going on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organizers agreed.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite strong torrential rain on Saturday night, music fans an estimated 1200 came to the Open-Air Festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">At times, the intake had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel l light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of two Spanish words, Dr. have made the name Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the open air in the castle garden Salzwedeler should radiate brightness on the day and in the evening with various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Well, and the fun comes anyway by alone.</seg>
<seg id="10">It became apparent early Saturday, when the first visitors to the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">The organisers had promised a celebration for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="12">And they succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supply stands in the castle garden meadow Salzwedeler, but also guests from the nearer and further surroundings had made themselves comfortable.</seg>
<seg id="14">Watched the first live performances, bobbed with the foot to the beat, enjoyed cold drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were announced.</seg>
<seg id="15">And across the generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">While is the one on blankets on the extra angekarrten white sand at the beach bar lümmelten, others used to wine in the wine cellar at a quarter, raged the offspring on the bouncy castle, which was a great attraction for the younger guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But also at the face painting volunteers in the truest sense of the word had busy all hands to the crowds to become and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The larger used Foosball tables or participated in a skateboard workshop, which directed the Goodfoot crew from Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the big rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 17:30 he pelting down on the visitors, mainly families searched for the vast and dry.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, this did not diminish the attractiveness of the Festival.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were more people than expected", said Ron Sem which spoke of a "success across the Board".</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore nothing precludes next year a repetition of the big party.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although content and size of the event still needs to work on, SEM made it clear in a first record on Sunday to the people's voice.</seg>
<seg id="25">He described as annoying, and that in the meantime the intake had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security firm with too little force was been booked.</seg>
<seg id="27">As a result, Some of those who had already paid, were no longer on the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate of Salzwedeler with co-organisers spoke of about 1200 visitors, who are busy in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound engineering.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hip hop band block 'n' ROX Salzwedeler broke off their appearance so unnerved.</seg>
<seg id="32">The technicians were not able to create a halfway reasonable sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned shisha lounges could not be rebuilt because the tents because of a flat tire could not be brought to Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Next year they will be but here", so the Organizer.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of Dr. open airs succeeded more than by the number of visitors.</seg>
<seg id="36">And the bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organizers have committed some error which still be forgiven the first time, but must be disposed of in the Second Edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">Also on the social network Facebook, the Organizer must insert criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for 12 euros you expected just more" reflected Melanie Meier on the event page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have taken over you unfortunately a bit", ele says Zakaria at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others see the initial problems not so tight.</seg>
<seg id="42">I find it very good, some just don't talk, but really try to put something on the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hats off! ", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Srinivas.</seg>
<seg id="44">Now time the organizers a year, to make these criticisms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pull the Castle clubs soon back together?</seg>
<seg id="2">Last, there was strife between the two Wolfratshauser Castle clubs again and again.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now think the Board members about a possible collaboration.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle of the late Richard Dimbath, former Chairman led the Wolfratshauser Castle friends, the project in the French Guédelon.</seg>
<seg id="5">A year ago, there was a not a good climate between the Association of the Castle and the Castle friends Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">The views of how the story should be dealt with the Wolfratshauser Castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different so far.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two sides are moving each other: it talks about a common approach to be taken soon.</seg>
<seg id="8">Board members Torsten Sjöberg (Castle Association) and Herbert Piffl (Castle friends) confirm that demand our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have phoned Mr Piffl and suggested that we once could sit down together," reported Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">All members of both clubs could pull his opinion in the future again together.</seg>
<seg id="11">Faster visible results can be so recorded.</seg>
<seg id="12">While the castle's friends to the suddenly departed Richard Dimbath had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in the eye until the last minute, the "development and experience bar making" the grounds at the forefront stands for the Castle Club to Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, second of Chairman of the friends of the Castle, has delighted according to own statements about the call.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death, he faces the Castle friends.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new President is to be found in mid-September at a General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently is one of the association according to the 74 around 40 members.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath have we let the club activities out of respect at first". This "thinking"phase may have been necessary, "to consider how it could continue".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Pak, the new Chairman should then go into the conversation with the Castle Club.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then the castle's friends could make a current mood image within their grouping.</seg>
<seg id="20">Pak says, there is no a candidate for the Presidency at the moment yet.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I'm confident that someone will find". He himself will not run because he takes up residence in bad Tölz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new Chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Tölzer wanted work on the project "but very happy to continue with".</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view in terms of reconstruction will remain in the eyes of Piffls probably in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">It commends Dimbath as a "Missionary", who always believed that the reconstruction of the Castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is no pie in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="27">Through a high level of participation of the population as well as volunteers from all over the world to be a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pak: "I was skeptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But in the course of time I have come more and more to the conviction, that it makes sense to promote the project. A "unique selling proposition" for the city of rafters could be created.</seg>
<seg id="30">There's nothing else here.</seg>
<seg id="31">Moreover, the project through EU grants, tickets for visitors and potential sponsors would be fundable, believes Pak.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I want to personally therefore not simply jettisoning the idea of reconstruction". He hoped that maybe something that moves the Castle Club in this point.</seg>
<seg id="33">Aimed initially to document the history, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save for university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1,000 amount per year, the almost second semester student Matt Schroeder pondered throwing a clever idea of saving himself.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a system of loans for books from students of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation, to delay the resale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My math book normally costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, who attends the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester had him $430 cost, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He gave $120 from.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board told the students in the more than 1,200 average $ annually spend on textbooks and study materials that there is cost containment options for the students, however.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeder's increasingly are the solution of choice for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks is popular, and so students can book a semester long use, often at a much cheaper price than buying.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 University book stores, said that the hiring of text books have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the industry, surveys show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores was hired last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all textbooks, National Association of college stores in campus bookstores are purchased according to the trade association.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the multiplication table for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buy online</seg>
<seg id="15">Some new books cost online only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, Chegg.com for 239,99 can however the specialized textbook retailer $ are involved.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy used</seg>
<seg id="18">If the notes of others or normal wear are nothing a, used books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93,49 to have.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Casaday, 25, degree student at Brigham Young University, says that he has issued 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of "strategic media decisions: understanding the business end of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was new for $48 sold.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, Director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without walls students asked their professors to ask whether previous editions were allowed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes, the updates for the term papers are not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, often, older issues can be purchased for a fraction of the cost for the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">Besides Suxen and Amazon, even Half.com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Rent</seg>
<seg id="27">Renting textbooks is a thought, if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and does not want to keep the books after completing the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.</seg>

<seg id="4">An article in the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that, when the children's films, the lack of quality of the movies themselves could be the reason.</seg>

<seg id="7">In July, entertainment weekly compared the average cinema score and Metacritic rating for any summer film release which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year to at least 2000 screens.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results are based on the opinions of movie-goers and film critic and indicate that the year's blockbuster are equivalent to those of last year.</seg>

<seg id="15">Because of the expected the summer 2015 potential box-office hit, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, minions and Jurassic World but more optimistic are other representatives of the film industry:</seg>
<seg id="16">The producer of X-men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in box office results recently as simple "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "the next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office at all, and nobody will see it more to the business concerns."</seg>

<seg id="1">Hütteldorfer for second win of the season on third of the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">With a 2-0 over Grödig a bitter week took for rapid a conciliatory end on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had achieved an intermediate low with the off in the Europa League on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The achievement was terribly important," confirmed captain and goalscorer Steffen Hofmann, who pushed three green white square.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel dream gate brings rapid rapid on road to victory has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second victory of the season and goes with a sense of achievement in the international break.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Defender Thomas Schrammel, which has paved the way to victory, with his magnificent leadership volley from the corner of sixteen er, in the 14 minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought, I'm the whole frustration Thursday in and smacked it under the crossbar", the 26-year-old said smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sajith 2010 met Novmember on the 13th for the most recent time in a Bundesliga game, was still for Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first championship match in the rapid dress will remain him in special memory.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It's something special for me, I'm from the rapid young," SAJI said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the short-term pool damage by Mario Pavelic, moved from the left to the right side of the defensive Schrammel and did also very well his thing.</seg>
<seg id="12">He has enough experience that he can exert this position also mirrored.</seg>
<seg id="13">He deserved the goal, he has done this year quite a few assists,"praised Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team shows character Schrammel supplied also the flank to 2-0 by Hofmann after over an hour, that finally brought the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because before that, also the guests could have written on.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we have had the luck today," remarked also Schrammel thus played on the gap of performance and results in the past few weeks: "the results have not voted, but playfulness was always good in comparison to last year".</seg>
<seg id="17">Baboo was even, that "in many games previously better than today"--been against "the strongest team that has played in this season in this stadium".</seg>
<seg id="18">The first Dreipunkter since 26 July have therefore proved that the setbacks despite the team structure was intact: "Today my team has shown that it has character".</seg>
<seg id="19">For him no less gratifying: "That we finally return to zero have played".</seg>
<seg id="20">Much work do even more valuable during international break also the fact that with Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting team debuts, the victory.</seg>
<seg id="21">"You must remember this", warned Baboo, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who were very stable lately".</seg>
<seg id="22">The international break must therefore be used "wounds to lick and to put a little bit in terms of physical", explained Baboo, who has five U21 selection players in its ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">One, the break is probably particularly situated, is Captain Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="24">He rips the team, goes beyond pain about it.</seg>
<seg id="25">He has shown in this severe phase, that he is a very important player for us", noted Barisic.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hofmann gave not only the structure the game of rapids before his substitution in the 68th minute, but scored the second gate.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year old, who completed his 350 League match, it was the first hit of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 on the Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "must not think that now everything is good" "we have had also a bit of luck, but sometime the luck must come back to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it was"high time, Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="30">He warned however to concentrated work: "you may see not always black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We have not so bad played in recent weeks, as it has been portrayed.</seg>
<seg id="32">We may not believe but also that now all is well.</seg>
<seg id="33">He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is a very young team, which at the moment I can greatly help.</seg>
<seg id="35">That stop at certain stages in me", said Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to throw himself and his team.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the quick goals "of the category magic gate", as well as the regular gate by net in the 40th minute, which was been wrongly stripped from referee Kollegger.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in several phases.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we have had too little financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was similar to the Defender Maximilian Karner: "it started equally bad, then we have found but pure and made even a goal.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the whole, more would have been.</seg>

<seg id="7">Vital is the natural monument, it extends beyond the other trees of nearby and reminiscent of an American giant Sequoia with a circumference of about eight metres.</seg>
<seg id="8">A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.</seg>
<seg id="9">But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.</seg>
<seg id="10">Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has extra consulted the Bischofsheimer archive and interviewed older people from white Unterbrunn to learn which circumstances did it with the Geißruheiche.</seg>
<seg id="11">The result of his investigations was the rather sober explanation for the name.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, the goat herders should have driven until about 80 years ago their animals under Weißenbrunn from the laboriously cleared and freed from stones meadows.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the foot of the tree the animal keeper, exhausted from the ascent should have rested.</seg>
<seg id="14">Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows, herds of goats graze actually.</seg>
<seg id="15">The area has been declared in addition to the core zone of the biosphere reserve, has further found Schneider.</seg>
<seg id="16">Upon entering the stone collections should be careful, but, because the basalt warmed up by the Sun is a popular place to stay for Adders.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demanded the inclusion of "Rule of talks" with the Eastern Ukraine Kiev</seg>
<seg id="2">The Russian President Wladimir Putin according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian Government is fighting against the separatists in the East of the country and immediately takes up with negotiations to the "rule"of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow made it clear later that Putin didn't mean the territory under the control of the separatists of the Eastern Ukraine to become part of Russia, but that his status against the Ukraine must be redefined, to give the power to represent their rights and interests of the Russian-speaking region.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's call to the Kiev Government to negotiations on equal footing with the pro Russian rebel suits but which by him since the beginning of the riots five months ago apparently strategy: help for the separatists in the business areas and pressure on the Ukrainian Government to the newly proclaimed region Novorossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of providing with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the State TV channel one Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture of the territories held by separatists in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have lately occupied area as "Novorossija" or "New Russia" referred to a term that the Russian Empire is reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that those who hope for Ukrainian politician for the elections on Oct. 26, while government groups attacking civilian communities in the areas held by separatists in the course of the campaigns early peace talks are "trapped in their illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We need to record immediately detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also to the political organization of society and the State status of the South-East Ukraine, to protect the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's reference to the rule of law in the context of the greater autonomy should be seen, discussed for months by the leadership of Kiev to allay concerns in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights are endangered.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian Government can give the necessary autonomy the eastern areas, said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between the Ukraine and Russia, said Peskov, "because it isn't about a conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, but an internal conflict in the Ukraine."</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscore the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, where ethnic Russians are the majority of the 2 million inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would be far greater, to annex the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in the East Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are Russians and polls indicate a large majority for remaining in the Ukraine from the time before the conflict began.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that was approached by Russian diplomats on international forums would proxy give the regional Governments in the Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreement and external relations, and de facto control over an area so the Kremlin, type that combines the Russian territory in Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The peninsula in the Black Sea five months ago annexed is the home port for the bulk of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostowgebiet in Russia and the Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries that manufacture important components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - should bear in mind additions to the Constitution after new elections - that greater control is given the respective territories about their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his notion of autonomy seems to be their arming and incitement Moscow accused in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's last call to Kiev, to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye level, followed a further advance of the rebels in the past week, after Russian troops and tanks have penetrated beyond the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea in the Eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The separatists supported by Russia took control of Nowoasowsk in the coup, which is according to fears Ukrainian security official to the Crimea, the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal area.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason massive civilian and military preparations are underway to Mariupol, a steel industry port of 500,000 to fix, which is situated between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked urgently for deeds, to prevent a further Russian aggression against the Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic, which has been independent since 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are nearing a point where there is no turning back," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU Summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should enter into force at an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk, after last week invaded the Donezkregion, said two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman of the Ukrainian national security and Defense Council reports to support the besieged separatists on Saturday in Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="27">The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers, which were closed by the Russian incursion in Ilovaysk, against 10 Russian paratroopers were exchanged on Sunday who had been captured to Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko announced on Sunday.</seg>
