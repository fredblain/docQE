<seg id="1">Back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">The congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have tabled a bill to establish the organization of trade unions and civil rights.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Unions are dying just as the middle class jobs," Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, and vice-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I proudly present together with the civil rights icon John Lewis, the employee empowerment law.</seg>
<seg id="5">This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination due to the organisation of trade unions, as with other forms of discrimination - and thus stop anti-union-minded forces.</seg>
<seg id="6">The completion of the national labour law in order to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers to organize a union representation, in order to sue in a civil court for justice - and in order to receive compensation or penalty payments - is a useful and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way is to suggest to the understanding of what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill, the link to a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the setbacks, which the unions were suspended in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans were encouraged in countries around the world to recognise work rights to extend and respect.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time in which millions of Americans remember, when this country democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association mentioned in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their trade unions participated in the creation of a new Japan, using a language that explicitly recognized that the rights of workers are guaranteed of association and collective bargaining and action. "</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressed the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">In recognition of the fact that the workers must organize and raise its voice in the new government added a clause explicitly testified: "The right to form and to safeguard the health and economic conditions and to improve each and every profession or trade.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict this right or aim to reduce it is null and void; targeted measures are illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other drafters added a guarantee that everyone has "the right to form trade unions for the protection of his interests or" to join them.</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advising others how to civilian and democratic societies could form, Americans said that the law must be protected on the establishment of a trade union - and that these unions could then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="19">After these rights were under attack in America, is it really wise, to lead the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and to have a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As pastor, Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher. "</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labour movement did not restrict the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">By raising the living standards of millions, labour miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to unimaginable levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack labour forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, and that is something we should do.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights and protection against discrimination in the establishment of employee representatives - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and simply delivering on the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never took me by the arm.</seg>
<seg id="2">Has never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children of a family jamaikanischer immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry, 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing for a comedy that's Rudy's Rare Records, which is based partly on an imaginary conversation with his father, and from the series on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.</seg>
<seg id="8">He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was hard to know him.</seg>
<seg id="10">We never saw his face, hear his voice: "Hearing on the crash.</seg>
<seg id="11">Keep your sister in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">Beweg you!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had such a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">A large part of my life, he was a serious guy in the corner, reading the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and even though the conditions are better than at the time of his father, he won, but an insight into how life may have been for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a little brighter now, but they are dark, quite smoky, deep stygische maze with flames and smoke and a lot of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father was always in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he was able to wash the foundry.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I went there, it was clear to me that he had done this for many years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him has been greater.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry grew up as a child without his parents "love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged me, he never said "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when it came to my mother at the end of her life, we started badly, "I love you, I love you, I love you" to say.</seg>
<seg id="24">By his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love that he had missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">But with the "I love you" stop?</seg>
<seg id="26">But on hearing to embrace me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Papa, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="31">It is still a French friend, with whom he had been married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should we not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">That contributed to her death.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I got this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it is tiring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one likes to eat carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's career change is reflected in his elegant, short-trimmed beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he is captured by the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It's the comedy of errors, and then fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy work life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started with only 16 years ago, when he worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ discovered him on stage when he wrote to imitierte and New Faces on him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was for a very long time, the only black impersonator/comedian on TV."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned in the profession.</seg>
<seg id="50">I was not only in the eyes of the public at large, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I tell jokes and an efficient machine, while I was a television star, and that was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny New Faces in 1975,</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager, the stage right at the Black and White Minstrel Show, had a light entertainment program in which people "" anmalten Black, Henry on his comedy about five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">In my family it was very unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="54">Somehow, I wish that it had never happened, but I do not regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on big projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.</seg>
<seg id="56">But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">The introduction of characters that the British black culture both celebrated and scorned,, Henry worked in the 1980s for an alternative comedy circuit.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Black Lock in the comedy series boss!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles were his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len because everything feels when you're just about the time or play a little on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">Then, a documentary series for Radio 4, entitled What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first episode revolved around Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">On Shakespeare, I was allergic.</seg>
<seg id="63">I had never really learned in school about it, and it kept him mostly for the domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I had a great fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "you should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was not a bad thing, if you do not know what are you talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Nimm a few of the words in his mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It was almost as if someone had my head finally right.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That is the issue, it is a serious thing, take it seriously, learning your text recherchiere a bit.</seg>
<seg id="72">The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car accident, and this simply not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly, I was at the National Theatre, and I could hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed you." "</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical error, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice said to me" you must now bridge 10 minutes while they repair the computer. ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the stage director, announced that the show would go on, once the problem is resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I went from the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">I am not responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to someone else.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play in a play, i.e. blowing in your role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">To learn the text for fences was demanding.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is very good, which strengthens the tendons.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was good, so it's like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your purpose here." "</seg>
<seg id="89">He says that, of course, with a thundering voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I stay here.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation of humorous outbursts, while he imitates people again.</seg>
<seg id="94">I have decided to stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of instant gratification in a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you are looking for that constantly, so you go in front of a wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I am sometimes live at the Apollo when I have fun, but overall, there is not as much as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask him if he ever returned to a stand-up comedy tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The fun I have in a room with a director who helps a beginning to form a middle section and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever lose again.</seg>
<seg id="99">So this is his new incarnation here?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think.</seg>
<seg id="101">I am quite an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">It always tells a story, and that is great.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>

<seg id="1">Children need roots and wings</seg>
<seg id="2">He was 44 years in the school, including 23 as a school principal.</seg>
<seg id="3">From that time, Manfred Richter knows many hardend Peter House and Kollbacher from their time as a student.</seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were unconventional, sometimes, but always carried by his desire to see the man in the student.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sněžka is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves the painting with the theme from his homeland.</seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, Trutnov.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even at 14 he became interested after four years of secondary school for the teaching profession.</seg>
<seg id="9">A year later, the Sudeten Germans were dispossessed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their house.</seg>
<seg id="11">After a few months in a camp in Bavaria in 1946, it was - in the boxcar.</seg>
<seg id="12">It convinces judges to the Upper Franconian village cut.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher education took place in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">In addition, Manfred Richter had to run six times a week, ten kilometres to the nearest railway station, take the train to Bamberg, there are three kilometres across the whole city to school and back in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months, Manfred Richter was in a Red Cross shelter in Bamberg, a bed, along with up to 15 other students in a dormitory.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951, he made the first and, after three years of teaching in 1954, the second state examination choice.</seg>
<seg id="17">As Upper Franconia for him had no free teacher job he applied to Upper Bavaria and on November 1, 1954, came to the school in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Miss-Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958, he moved to new teachers in the house next to the school, a three-room-service.</seg>
<seg id="20">Manfred Richter bought the house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was disbanded in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the meantime, there were the school association in Kollbach Kollbach Peter G three classes and Peter "five.</seg>
<seg id="22">From the 1968/69 academic year, they have been grouped together in Peter "in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the association was founded in Indian village, remained the primary school in the village.</seg>
<seg id="24">In order to avoid a demotion in the small school's rector George Sigl, according to Karl, and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">But Peter "grew, and so did the children and their teachers from September 1982 to the present building, which was expanded in 1997 after a judge's retirement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praised the generosity of the then Lord Mayor Ludwig Götz, who in addition to local costs and build a factory space in the basement extension in 1997, although that according to the guidelines for school buildings was not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor Götz had" very friendly school, judge gratefully remembered.</seg>
<seg id="28">In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government representative, who had responded to a department of education on law and justice: "One must never forget the love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"You have to give to the children of two things: Roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">And he had to learn: "That is not always possible." Whether he is here only says his students, or just his own six children, not entirely clear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case, Judge Tun was sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If they got beat up students, not a punitive operation and were ordered not to sit.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the expense of local judges had to acquire two pairs of gloves and play the two sides against each other, even though there should be a violets.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the good of the school judges used as a good relationship with the former mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">This was the side judge after his retirement, at least, the last in 1996 at the CSU list for the local council to stand.</seg>
<seg id="36">But judges have been selected at number six and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="1">With Rona fair head the BBC has found perhaps the great director she needs.</seg>
<seg id="2">She meets with a proud fame tow from the banking world, the media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.</seg>
<seg id="3">And it has its own front line experience.</seg>
<seg id="4">Her career began at the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bomba, ICI and the world's media.</seg>
<seg id="5">She was seven years back, CEO of the Financial Times and came when the top post of the parent company's went to a younger male colleague.</seg>
<seg id="6">Your severance allegedly amounted to almost £1 million.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even their political ranking is solid.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was David Cameron recommended by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more commercial expertise in Whitehall: It became an adviser to the cabinet.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her husband, a former Tory councillor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Back in May, I described the role of the chairman with a poisoned chalice.</seg>
<seg id="11">Not only the BBC is a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.</seg>
<seg id="12">The trust works in two directions: Inside at the first guard of their own management hierarchy at the BBC, but also to the outside as the voice of public concern and anxiety when things go wrong.</seg>
<seg id="13">This ensures an almost untenable duopoly, which demands a full comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the new incoming president would risk it, to strike at everything and disassemble an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he expresses themselves perhaps his job.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a difficult task.</seg>
<seg id="16">And as if that were not enough, many are keen to see the BBC reduced - outdated power, money and status.</seg>
<seg id="17">While the competition approaches and new technologies threaten the old, comfortable certainties, the upcoming negotiation of the royalties for the BBC is connected with special dangers.</seg>
<seg id="18">For the modest sum of £145,50 per year, the British public certainly buys into the largest media company in the world.</seg>
<seg id="19">The BBC tells a good story: It says that it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each of them only costs 40 pence a day.</seg>
<seg id="20">And the BBC seem to rise on the popularity scale upwards again: 53 percent now support it, compared with 31 percent 10 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">The sight and usage habits for the BBC have changed: Now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it remains a very beloved and important institution.</seg>
<seg id="23">It needs a great leader - I hope she has found him.</seg>

<seg id="2">A tweet from the official account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a disparaging remark about Democratic county prosecutor, which is at the heart of a criminal charge against him for misuse of authority.</seg>
<seg id="3">The tweet was later deleted and replaced with another of Perry's account of the previous abstritt.</seg>
<seg id="4">Just a tweet was sent from my account, which was not authorised by me.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I do not approve of the tweet and have deleted" for him, it was said in the message.</seg>
<seg id="6">Employees of Perry did not immediately responded to requests for comment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although the tweets of Perry's official account, it was not clear who actually uses the feed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In an earlier tweet an unfavourable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Clay, who was sentenced in April 2013 due to drink-driving.</seg>
<seg id="9">Perry vetoed the funding of her office when she refused to step down, which could result in a charge against Perry - the potential 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.</seg>
<seg id="10">The text of the tweets reads: "I'm not always drunk with the triple allowable alcohol... but when I do I accuse, Governor Perry, if he ausplaudert it."</seg>
<seg id="11">I am the betrunkenste Democrat in Texas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Clay's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the investigation of the grand jury against Perry.</seg>
<seg id="13">This was led by Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.</seg>
<seg id="14">Perry pleads not guilty to and called the indictment a political ploy.</seg>
<seg id="15">Its outstanding team of legal assistance requested by the judge entrusted with the case, rejecting the charges and argued that the law, which for the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas, is vague in its wording.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit, which is based in Travis County and in cases of public corruption in Texas - identified as a clay hill refused to resign.</seg>
<seg id="17">This veto of a public complaint from a left-wing watchdog group.</seg>
<seg id="18">Perry's official account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the rallies in Iowa during his presidential candidacy had finished in fifth place in 2012, Perry referred to speculation that he will stop when he posted a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we are coming!"</seg>

<seg id="2">One of the most prominent developers of London pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England has returned back to normal levels. "</seg>
<seg id="3">Homes in the capital, hotly sought-after and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England because of the widespread fear of a credit bubble were intended to put limits on mortgage loans in June.</seg>
<seg id="4">Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of first-class investment company Berkeley on Monday, said: "Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market is back to normal levels of transaction since the 2013 peak back" and added that it offers a "stable operating environment."</seg>
<seg id="5">The housing market in London was well established during the downturn, as foreign buyers piled into the capital.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to information from the cadastral office prices in the city have increased in the past year alone by 18.5 percent, far more than the average rise in England and Wales as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="7">The average selling price for private Berkeleys, cheap and student services rose by about a fifth last year and were at the end of April to £423.000.</seg>
<seg id="8">However, a stronger pound has made in recent months in London property less attractive to foreign buyers - some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "tax" before the general election next May.</seg>
<seg id="9">The London estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report presented in April, where stricter lending rules would also in the second half of the year to lower market growth in both property sales and prices.</seg>
<seg id="10">New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also points out that the real estate market cools.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the increase in property prices in London for 2015, down to 3 percent, on the basis of an already-weakening house price consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="12">The transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, meanwhile fell by a quarter year on year, the real estate agent WA Ellis.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the desire for a home in the capital city of Berkeley is a blessing, since the sums due to forward sales amounting to more than £2.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for a proper, well-planned product remained stable in the best locations and as a result the futures sales have remained stable."</seg>
<seg id="15">In June, the company reported that it had sold 3.742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="16">The annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent annually to £280 million, sales by 18% to £1.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="17">On Monday, in a statement before the annual meeting of the company Mr Pidgley said that revenues in the current year for Berkeley would be expected to match the current market expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many of the analysts estimate the annual pre-tax earnings to £450 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Berkeley shares were trading in the afternoon at the London firm at £23,96.</seg>

<seg id="2">You zerflossen, one could best describe it, she slowly dissolved like a cardboard box that you have to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, demanding, intense, aloof and perhaps slightly kratzbürstig.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then the hand shook him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Kratzbürstig he knew.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was stachelig, like hedgehogs, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this barbed approach was a very nascent affair for which was promising a relief of boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him a certain amount of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ailinn Solo Mons was a trembling, delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more isolated and hostile than Port Reuben.</seg>
<seg id="9">It came with an older companion to the south, Kevern held for her aunt, who had inherited a plot in a damp but heavenly valley with the aptly named Paradise Valley.</seg>
<seg id="10">For several years, no one had lived in the house.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were leck, the bathrooms were spiders, slugs have left their mark on all the windows, and believed that they belong to all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like the house out of a children's story, both menacing and seductive, a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" on the long list for the Man Booker Prize is 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced in the coming week.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kevern and Ailinn holding had sat on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both had been playing a spirit absent in the console, which supplied the country with soothing music and besänftigenden news than the sight of her brown legs crossed reminded him of an old song, one long forgotten black entertainer, which his father had listened with closed blinds in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - Nothing was played so well - just not banned.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been successful obsolesziert, like the word obsoleszieren.</seg>
<seg id="20">The general flavour created what decrees and regulations had never managed, and how the people in the book From-dishwasher-to-millionaire-memoirs, cookery books and romantic novels, so she chose the music for the ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the euphoria of the day began to play an imaginary piano Kevern and a gross-funny serenade Ailinns big feet to eulogise, sing.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn understood that.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a well-known song of a jazz pianist called Fats 1971," he told her, and automatically put two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">It had always done his father to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="25">It began as a game between him and his father, when he was still small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, as he was told.</seg>
<seg id="27">When you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game back then, and it was not very funny.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew what was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">It had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard of any.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz was, even though he was not directly prohibited, not played.</seg>
<seg id="33">The improvisation was not more modern.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only room for one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">The people wanted to be at the beginning of a melody, where it would end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Similarly, the mind.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability made people nervous.</seg>
<seg id="38">And Jazz was musically ausgedrückter mind.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he was 10 years old, without having heard about Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz by the semi-secret collection of old CDs of his father.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he had to explain Ailinn, Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">At their age, they probably could not remember a time when Popsänger were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of the group talent - grateful like fate spared.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of Afro-Caribbean origin were by temperament and conformation for entertainment and sports, so she sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">People who were originally from the Indian subcontinent, were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were served with the task of ensuring that no family was left without a working telephone service.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of the Polish community, took care of the sewage system; what was left of the Greeks smashed plate.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf states and the Levant, whose grandparents left the country quickly than WHAT GESCHEHEN ship IF IT GESCHEHEN ship geschah- for fear of being accused of Feuerschürens, fearing that the flames would consume them next - had Labneh- and shisha-pipe-restaurants opened, consider themselves and were depressed by inaction.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">Because she had heard only ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that she had just vorgesungen Kevern, could ever be synchronized.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"These are not really" offensive, Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, perhaps, for people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father has never offended anyone, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still not understood.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why did your father would love such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a Jux, however, hesitated to show again in its present two fingers to their lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">You already thought that it was a little odd.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It was funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief and impeded Keverns view.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing else in the whole world to see as their ungekämmtes pitch black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">There was nothing that he wanted to see otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say" it, they believe, without conviction.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still does not explain why you vorsingst it myself.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed genuinely concerned.</seg>
<seg id="67">My feet are too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet are not so directly.</seg>
<seg id="70">Perhaps your ankles, a little bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say that you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">But hate?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I do not hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">This is just a silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you think" me, he tried it instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I am a bit perverse.</seg>
<seg id="78">That was not right.</seg>
<seg id="79">It was supposed to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">When he tried to be funny, he was often in trouble because he did not like his father about the soothing charm needed to bezähmen the inherent cruelty in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Perhaps he, Kevern, wanted to be.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solo Mons was red and rose from her deck chair, threw the console and buried the wine they were drinking.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elder flowers, wine, drunkenness was no excuse for him.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head is exactly the reason why I am drawn to office," you feel, she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I am not even that.</seg>
<seg id="89">She was tired of him, both because of the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and the fear that was in their eyes when they rebelled against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">They dachte, that he would beat them?</seg>
<seg id="91">She had not told him about the life on the cold northern archipelago, where she was raised, but he had no doubt that it was essentially just like here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and icy ocean broke here and there on the shore.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men with even thicker skin and verdrießlicher after THIS WAS GESCHEHEN ship as it were their ancestors as smugglers and wreckers, moved from pub to pub, always willing to raise a hand against a woman who refused them or derided.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">It would have shown her a big fist, if not farewells.</seg>
<seg id="96">She only kissing - kissing the most-used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they were only kissing and then beat.</seg>
<seg id="97">After Keverns believes this was an unnecessary refinement, because kissing was itself an act of violence.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solo Mons gave him to go through her body.</seg>
<seg id="99">He arose from the deck chair, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">They also felt bleiern, but the impact of his grief surprised them.</seg>
<seg id="101">That was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him as he departed, as from a room on the upper floor of their companion was watching him - a man, complaining of what he himself had created.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaves the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a sudden pain for him, and men in general, although some have raised their hands against it.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned away from her, his back bent, embarrassed, defeated without fighting spirit - why this was a sight that she seemed to know when she could not remember a single occasion on which she had seen something in the present day?</seg>
<seg id="107">When she was alone again, Ailinn Solo Mons looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Several years before the events just told working ESME Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, non-legislative oversight body for the public mood, with a short talk about the continued violence at low and intermediate level in exactly the areas where the reduction, if not elimination, most likely to be expected, given the money and energy into eradicating such violence had been invested.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot still needs to be done," she wrote, "in order to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people that a thousand wars waged and won most of them, especially in the remote areas and valleys of the country in which the sweet breath of human kindness has been historically felt despite the towering spires of the hedges.</seg>
<seg id="110">But, it turns out, some properties of erroneous belief.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the tower, it seems, the lower the passion he arouses.</seg>
<seg id="112">The people crying when listening to sentimentaler ballads, enthralled by stories about overcome difficulties and claims to believe strongly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former rudeness maintains the rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and devious argument looks at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration, her mentor meant when he had read the entire report.</seg>
<seg id="114">I suggest that you read more novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">ESME Nussbaum lowered its head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I also have to ask: You are an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe that I have to say no," ESME Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again, ESME invoked their right to privacy and refusal of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?.</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz said finally, "because I would be against atheism, Lesbentum or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This here is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We serve a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain types of hyper-sensitivity that are perfectly acceptable and commendable, can occasionally results, as you have presented it to distort.</seg>
<seg id="126">You yourself seem to have prejudices against the church, and those things you describe as "sneaky" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as an expression of a natural strength and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you continue to beat down on this, WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN, as if it, if it would have happened would have happened yesterday means to deprive the country of its essential vitality.</seg>
<seg id="128">For ESME Nussbaum felt, while Rabinowitz said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head, repeated an LED sticker in flamingo pink, the advice, the country in the last quarter-century Ofnow or longer.</seg>
<seg id="130">You Lächeln to their neighbours, you value your partner, you hear ballads go, musicals, you use your phone, you talk, you say that you listen, you agree that you apologize.</seg>
<seg id="131">Speaking is better than silence, the song is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I understand completely what you want, ESME Nussbaum replied," with a quiet voice when she was sure that her boss had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing other than that we are not yet healed as effective as we are deluding ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that we may find ourselves without warning about how we repeat the mistakes in THIS WHAT IS GESCHEHEN IF IT IS GESCHEHEN.</seg>
<seg id="134">This time, however, it is not the other where we miss our anger and our mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with the hands.</seg>
<seg id="136">In order to indicate a patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as a" mistake "that perhaps our grandparents or not.</seg>
<seg id="138">You also go too far when you say that they had their "anger" and their "suspicion" to "other" left out.</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position, that we talk about the understanding of the past, such as in the protection of the present, not "us" and "other."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and there were no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, which is all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"From the daring, if we are honest with ourselves," ESME smash, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I accuse no one.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done badly or well, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">That was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing more needs to be said - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And like any blame must be assigned, so no debt must be repaid if such repayment would be appropriate, and if there was a way to wipe them out.</seg>
<seg id="148">But what about the past, if we do not learn from it -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past is that we forget about them.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I may say something about this</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Rabinowitz did not coincide his pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will consider their report, he said," and dismissed them.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcycle driver who described how passers-by, in a sort of "brutal rage" on the footpath.</seg>
<seg id="154">There are coincidences.</seg>

<seg id="2">Official representatives of the military in Lesotho are contending that they have planned a coup to topple the government and said they targeted police officers, which is accused of arming political fanatics.</seg>
<seg id="3">Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and announced that the army of the country have occupied his official residence and surrounding government buildings in the capital, Maseru.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Premier expressed his family into the neighboring South Africa after he had reported threats of attack.</seg>
<seg id="5">Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no de facto coup d'etat, but the army on the threat from "political fanatics" response, whose arm was by the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after he received several intelligence reports that some elements within the police are that some of the political, partisan young fanatics actually wanted to arm men who were on the verge of causing havoc," he said on Voice of America.</seg>
<seg id="7">The South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action made the impression of a country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manufacturing in the eurozone at a 13-month-low</seg>
<seg id="2">The increase in production in the euro zone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, a closely watched survey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit purchasing managers index (PMI) for the manufacturing sector fell to 50,7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A number above 50 indicates an expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders fell and factory experienced declines in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The numbers arrive before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets expect the bank a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation with an inflation rate of only 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during the course of this week, if he pulls a quantitative easing in the eurozone, according to those who were from Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although a small growth is better than no growth, the deterrent effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become clearer for the manufacturers," Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory-PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner of Russia within the EU, fell to the lowest level in 11 months with 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc and France, the PMI fell to the second-largest economy on 46,9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a concern, as well as the descent of Italy by a solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Evidence that growth incentives in key industrial mechanism, Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer are not reassuring, "said Mr Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The decline of the industry probably feeds the fire of the analysts, who expect further monetary or fiscal stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="15">The positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the purchasing managers index of manufacturing in the euro zone in August, is that the sector will continue to grow after that."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "In the euro area producers will find life very difficult at the moment, obviously, since the current heightened geopolitical tensions increase - particularly in relation to Russia and Ukraine - uncertainty over the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and will probably mean that some jobs will be delayed or even cancelled, particularly large-scale orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually have to take a kind of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="34">I am pleased that many people in the world still recall with horror, and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I see the pictures of me online, I zurückklettere in school, I think that a lot of people see it for the first time, to understand our disaster and help to ensure that this does not happen again.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy, who fled through the bullets, in the view that his mother was dead</seg>
<seg id="37">It was his first day of school (Russians go to school with 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother, Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">After seven years, he said: "Mom told me that I should come to me if there was an explosion, and hold their hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After an explosion, he thought she would die.</seg>
<seg id="40">She said to him: "Run."</seg>
<seg id="41">Full of fear, they could be dead, he fled, and saw on the way a wine of infant, took it by the hand and fled with bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father, Vladimir, who concluded his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother has died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I could not save them."</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, according to Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the assumption that their son had died.</seg>
<seg id="45">After its reunification, she said: "I wept with joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="48">Damir was later flown to London (now dissolved) from the newspaper News of the World to obtain by the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion.</seg>
<seg id="49">"This horror is watching you every day, but I wish I could stop with the reminder," he said yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="50">But I can say that in my memory it will be fainter.</seg>
<seg id="51">I know that I immediately after man ever threw away all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I am not afraid to go back to the gym, but I do not think me about.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember these kids with whom I played in the yard, and who did not.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they have been killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they are in the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember very well my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I could choose what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he has caused anxiety around places like Ukraine, where wars, the kind of accident that he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop to remember.</seg>
<seg id="60">"I am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">So I want to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">One day, I want to go to the police and hope that they take me next year at the training academy.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "Thirty-seven children were killed from our neighbourhood, you can imagine it?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there was simply no children who were able to set up and run around, and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She remembers vividly of her trip to London with Damir.</seg>
<seg id="66">The people of London cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">At the time, I understood how people can understand on the other side of the world, our feelings and show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could talk to Cherie and tell her just that 10 years have passed, but I still like to meet her and her husband to me in London, and how that Damir and has helped me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember how Damir wanted to eat borscht and phoning them all local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot with his water pistol at them and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And that was just a month after the horror.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was surprised that the British are so readily shared our pain and support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I always think that this world is not in these 10 years, become better.</seg>
<seg id="75">In Ukraine, the war continues, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">These are just such children as ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think that for many, the war is a part of the messages they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I know what these people feel, the whole horror.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop to feel that.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, the people still want to kill themselves and that is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir was and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know he doesn't like it, but he has six close friends from the class, and they sometimes go into the gym and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was small he suffered, including - I remember how he was sometimes on the sofa, the face turned from us for hours on end.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I remember how he threw all of his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, handsome, bigger than me, intelligent and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that several hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I recovered myself after the explosion and saw the legs I came to me, and the hell looked around me, with body parts lying around.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I called him," Damir, according to go on, "but I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he has heard it, and he ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">And so life goes on, unlike that of many others, for us.</seg>

<seg id="96">His face was scarred by blutüberströmtes fear when he ran for his life, while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His image was one of the most shocking images of the barbarity of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him for his first day of school, before she rushed off to get their older son, Vladimir.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I left the court for about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it and my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but all of them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date comes, the more difficult it is to remember and to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day that we do not remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days have me constantly.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will ever forget that, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Eindringlich: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized in a statue (right).</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that on that day (so wanted to go to school, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only knew that he was alive when I saw him on television.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue of a weeping born in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy sees the image, and it's hidden at home on the bookshelf.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand that, but I also think that the people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy says today: "It is important that such a thing can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People always look at such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">And now they are examining the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is becoming something awful.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I cannot understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years of nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to forget it a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has attacked my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I have had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.</seg>
<seg id="123">Later, I went back to school in 2004 and was afraid every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That is why I always go to the gym when the moves closer to 1 September.</seg>
<seg id="126">I would like to pay my tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I am not a victim, this story is now a part of my past.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it, but I am not bemitleide.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I have concluded this year, the school and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.</seg>

<seg id="134">I wanted to be a soldier, but my health has not allowed it.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country, but this will not happen.</seg>
<seg id="136">Georgi Fanijew,</seg>
<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, though he was imprisoned at the feet of a murderous terrorists</seg>
<seg id="138">A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was during the siege at the feet of a murderous terrorist, but he managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="139">During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat next to the bomb, which was mounted at the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It really is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"We feel it, as if it were yesterday," Georgy, who wanted to go to the FSB, the intelligence officer says, but this could do for his health damage due to the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with bad experiences - I have to say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I actually felt a little better after that, but I can not forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - a year later - was the first and only time that I went back to the gym.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I will never go back there again and ask me not to show you where I have sat in this famous image.</seg>
<seg id="149">Survivor: Georgy Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in a hospital after the siege on the laptop</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry him with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not think like them or talk about it and they never asked me after school.</seg>
<seg id="152">Physically, I feel good.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my injured knee, but now I can run well.</seg>
<seg id="154">But because of my health, I was unable to study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I have my documents, including those submitted medical and she responded that it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have been there two years behind me.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I knew that I would never tell my children from my experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">Children should know nothing about it and they should not suffer it too, of course.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">He is in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go to the celebrations for the memory.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that Georgy will not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">There needs to be much more violent for him, because he was there, and I do not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I waited for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he has been returned to me, here in Beslan are all drawn from it.</seg>
<seg id="168">It remains in us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is now an adult, but the horror is still in him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to accept that, if something happens to one so Unfaires.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he loves sports, but he could not attend because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He was operated on several times, he can run, but no sport.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This terrible experience will haunt us forever.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege, and that only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I have lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could use me, but my heart cries for the killing.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know of families where the children were born, but also by widows who have never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that there is life, even if you do not want that.</seg>
<seg id="180">I shall never forget how my heart jumped on me when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">And now I, what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are these people?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why do they kill each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is now very close to our country and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine already, and many are killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we just take all these rebels and could throw - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="192">In 2004, the world held its breath when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="193">The terrorists let them go, but kept in their cruelty, their 30-year-old mother, a 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="194">Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.</seg>
<seg id="195">Her father, Ruslan has since married again and with his new wife, Svetlana has a little girl that he had named after his lost daughter Kristina.</seg>
<seg id="196">Aljona, now ten years old, remembers the siege and has grown to be an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.</seg>
<seg id="197">"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or videos under water, there is a range of devices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-Cam as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these photos in a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of less than $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Check your equipment twice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other subjects are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Put your camera on the photos or videos that you want to include.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording modes by which the exposure time is optimized for dämmrigen underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump into it, you check your equipment is operational in the depth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are permitted only for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Search in our shopping guides and reviews of digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Make multiple shots - because many of them will not work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras are equipped with an LCD, with which you can compose images, not usually action-cams.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see under water, and the right image is a matter of luck.</seg>
<seg id="16">So you are making a lot of shots.</seg>
<seg id="17">If your camera has a series mode, with a series of shots with different exposure settings are made, you use it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay close to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The light is dramatically worse, the further you move away from the surface.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, you remain close to the surface, if you make shots in a pool, a lake or the sea.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a result, you can also get more colour into your photos; the deeper you go, the less you'll see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Go to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is also a good advice on land, but underwater, it is even more important because of the poor lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is particularly important when you work with an action-cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you have to get closer to their homes, if they are to complete the whole picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort, change the nature of things, even in such a huge organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">As a consulting physician anesthesia, he devoted his career to save the hospital, both the agony of the disease and the ordeal of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among his patients, remembers his wife, was an MI6 staff, with the devastating effects of torture had to live.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that the diagnoses and disease are important to doctors, while the cases are mostly preoccupied with something quite different: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose ordeal began.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have felt" not me, "he wrote in May of this year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I had difficulties to raise me.</seg>
<seg id="8">While he struggled with the flu-like symptoms, he noted that he made his wife Juliet impatient accusations.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want it all now rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet for a week on a business trip, Lawson felt quite unusually, and worried for no reason.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was something in the air.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to carry out an X-ray examination of his chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The result of the X-ray examination before.</seg>
<seg id="15">He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the breast skin, the lungs via the skin.</seg>
<seg id="16">As with most cancers, the exact trigger is often difficult to determine.</seg>
<seg id="17">While some smokers suffering from lung cancer, for example, have not been all lung cancer before smoking.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the underlying cause is an asbestos exposure - contact with the fibrous material, which was once seen as a "wonder material" but now recognized as lethal.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can ignore as easy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous Asbesttyp has been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the industry committed voluntarily to use them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even where he was employed, only people in certain sectors were working directly with the fabric - plumbers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">As an industrial hazardous material from a different time, he now seems to be little concern.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it seems, is the culmination of a Mesoltheliom-epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more deaths from be mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, so many people to this disease than die in road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual numbers of Mesotheliomtodesfälle since 1980 and estimated future deaths in Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we are now witnessing the deadly effects, although asbestos is illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that an be mesothelioma develops only after decades.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the scourge of be mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and still is, in the houses in which we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.</seg>
<seg id="33">And therefore be mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limitations, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The privileged bastions of the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a protected space.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even in the hospitals, in which we are supposed to be healthy, have already been identified as a result of this deadly Karzinogens herd.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not a plumber.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was difficult for him to imagine where he could possibly have come in contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he found it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It looks as if it was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed six years of my education," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All of them - students, nurses, doctors and doorman - use the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will suffer from the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">Unfortunately, he was unable to answer that question, at least in part.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who have been trained at Guy's Hospital" and that "in the last five years suffering from mesothelioma, in 2010, he wrote in a letter," I am the last one who still lives. "</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us are still ill?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson be mesothelioma at the age of 48 years has been diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February of this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">It was an unusually long time for survival.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of all Mesotheliomerkrankten die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">The disease is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will fall ill?"</seg>
<seg id="53">The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050 if the asbestos epidemic is expected to arrive in the UK to a standstill, a total of 90,000 of the disease have fallen victim.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most of them have no idea at the moment that they are going to die.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick look at the files of the courts to which the victims are often due to damages, shows how far the scourge of Mesothelioms is already widespread.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June of this year, Marks & Spencer, for example, admitted to have exposed asbestos Janice Allen negligent way.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagship store in Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old than when she began her work in M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their twenties.</seg>
<seg id="61">They "Before this thing," says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I really didn't do anything about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never thought that this would affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">The fact is that the notion of asbestos is not a substance, but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">The name stems from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fibre structure, which makes the polymer tough and flexible.</seg>
<seg id="66">Three of the six were used in the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used for roof tiles, floor tiles, pipe insulations, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but nonetheless by the EU and the WHO considered "high health risk" with possible fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="70">The more dangerous brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that there is a "clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high Mesotheliomraten."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer's flagship store in Oxford Street, London, exposed to asbestos Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen has perhaps not seen as a typical Mesotheliomopfer, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has presented a study of those concerned, given that a significant proportion of Mesotheliome without known suspension through work or in the home "was probably caused by asbestos exposure in the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">A large proportion of these contacts, according to his statement is based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It looks as though no one could expect to be safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report by Goddard Consulting, which studied the palace of Westminster, shows how people could be at the heart of the government, unknowingly have been exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="78">Goddard in 2009 reported that the service shafts and pipes behind the committee rooms of the House were contaminated with asbestos, the lethal fibers could be created by something as harmless as "strong air movements."</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are often accused of having to look after their own interests, but in this case it looks as if the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the management of the Parliamentary Work Service insisted that the Westminster Palace, a "clean health certificate" have received, it is now undisputed that cost £1 billion to be spent over several years, to renovate the Parliament, to modernize the electrical installations and to remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, the MEPs are more likely in the nearby QE2-conference meetings will be on the green benches at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos is not handled in accordance with the relevant provisions."</seg>
<seg id="82">No one can know whether this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait. "</seg>
<seg id="84">A person who could never determine the contact with asbestos exactly Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson suggested the 50-year-old Abbott, who during his work in hospitals was exposed to the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can not prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It is so difficult to remember all the places where they have worked, and to the data.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers of the day is still just at the beginning of December 2009, when he received a kind of Fieber.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and conducted an operation just late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly, I had chills.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came suddenly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt horrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought the ride home not to create more.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain come from the breast skin, the skin around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But, like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He was not a month to work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Doctors made verwunderte x-rays of his chest and anchor Pleurakathether, in order to remove fluid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="98">His complaints, however, remained without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">His health stabilized slowly, and he returned to his job.</seg>
<seg id="100">From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after physical activity and heavy breathing.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, Abbott's a patient with similar symptoms in his practice, and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even now, Abbott combined this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection was clear in this case.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbotts condition again deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray pictures to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott had felt ill for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the decor of ribs and chest fur.</seg>
<seg id="107">I am an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I am mostly just go, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">To be honest, I had not even made me so many worries.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was worried.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to get a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">Only now, he realised the extent of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread," particularly in large public buildings, where pipes were insulated with asbestos, he said.</seg>
<seg id="116">The people who were exposed to the asbestos in these buildings are now.</seg>
<seg id="117">And so now be mesothelioma strikes younger people who have not worked in the traditional professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation layer beneath the earth in hospitals, so patients were more likely to not exposed to the substance.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many people who ate in pedestrian tunnels changed from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground restaurants (such as Graham Abbott often did), most likely to come in contact with toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">It turns out that the patients for several decades after the war hospitals were potentially lifesaving, but life-threatening for the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="121">He is still.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students from their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was due to its fabulous insulating and flame properties often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls.</seg>
<seg id="125">Even schools.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many people have probably had the first contact with asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, thousands of chemistry lessons, pupils have parked their Bunsenbrenner on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">On the issue of asbestos sites is now often mentioned in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And while innocent objects in our houses, such as floor plates or shingle roofs are included by default as asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison that is contained in large parts of our properties," Andrew Morgan, said the lawyer, who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, who imagined an affected woman, was the demolition of a Gartenschuppens in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So you, as you continue your garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to process it, Mr Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I could not concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">Two weeks ago I was in practice.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I knew that I go and had to concern myself with myself.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="139">The biggest difficulty with the perspective of the position of a doctor to a patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed by all the information with which he had to come.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was very difficult to absorb all this," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor how long I have?"</seg>
<seg id="143">And it gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember that I thought, "Oh well, I will not see another Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's "then."</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-support mechanism - breathing itself that caused the deadly cancer is.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of mesothelioma caused by asbestos exposure.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">If the asbestos is infamous and resound to the fibers, they can look at the breast skin, the skin around the lungs set around.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the breast skin and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is with the inhalierten needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart/thorax doctor who in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, by Andrew Lawson claimed that it has exposed him to asbestos, ironically, is now a leading centre for the treatment of mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely to face during their training at the hospital of the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed by the breathing process, where the skin is.</seg>
<seg id="155">By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual options for other cancers don't work so well for mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="157">For example, the effectiveness of an operation is hotly contested.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some say that it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure denies.</seg>
<seg id="160">"It is not the breast skin" cut out, he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">They do not come around with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which shows the "impact," but not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients actually live a long time, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggling.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he had contacted mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, a one-man support and consulting office for Mitbetroffene.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, cancer center," he imagined happily on calls.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was" very positive, "Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Originally, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months and is expected to extend its life by only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to make things in a slightly more positive light. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Following the advice of several doctors decided Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, cardiac-thoracic specialist at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage by the fact that I had to be referred, I called and got an appointment," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial to-be mesothelioma sufferers, the best available therapies to exercise.</seg>
<seg id="180">But if those treatments fail, eventually, inevitably, many people are of a different financial concern - the future of the families that they left behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher water House LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous for the health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960s, it was realized that even a very low burden posed a health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally put their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his contact was a mesothelioma asbestos on the guy's back.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the guy's, however, confirmed that the asbestos fibres were removed from the basement area in the 1990s. "</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How can be removed asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, it is to-be mesothelioma sufferers who are seeking compensation, a huge problem, the deadly asbestos exposure to a company or a job, usually decades after the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance documents can be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who oppose claims to know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, there have been significant new legislation earlier this year that it makes for easier Mesotheliom-victims to claim compensation, even though their former employers are no longer detectable.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has established a fund sponsored by the insurance industry by £350 million for those diagnosed after July 2012, show a contact, but will be able to sue anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 percent of what a court in a normal compensation process would appeal to them - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful applications to the program are expected per year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan thinks like so many Mesotheliom-affected that £350 million a "very good job" of the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, and indicates that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if the time had not gone away and mesothelioma patients-businesses find and normally they could sue.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, former work and pensions minister, admitted that the bill was "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admitted that rapid action was given seven deaths a day.</seg>
<seg id="202">"The people are suffering so much and need help now," said Penning during the second hearing of the mesothelioma Act in December of last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">At that point, Graham Abbott for 19 months in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their first meeting Lazdunski Lang-recommended an operation from which he, unlike Tom Treasure expects a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was from a radiation therapy and chemotherapy followed - a triple therapy, with Lang-Lazdunski a survival rate over five years by up to 40 percent can present.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, the most important thing, Abbott says.</seg>
<seg id="208">We see that time and time again in patients.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is something that you can go on.</seg>
<seg id="210">If you place, you very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott underwent the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">At the end of August, he was the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">After scans showed no sign of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several spots around my breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is lebensbeendend.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now, no trace of the tumours is more visible.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is physically and mentally very tiring.</seg>
<seg id="222">You need to think about practical things - about money, when I am no longer, for example, or my wife, show how the boiler time setting.</seg>
<seg id="223">If you receive bad news, you will be negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is difficult for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to know what to say and how much.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I received my first diagnosis, I said to my girls that I had a disease with which I would not be old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and candies.</seg>
<seg id="231">They told their friends, and it soon, we got a lot of calls.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more restrained.</seg>
<seg id="233">She said not much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such talks are something that all cancer patients have to go through.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for Mesotheliomerkrankte such talks are not of hope, not a trace of hope of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease causes (such as for Stephen Jay Gould), a grim security.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to allow Hong Kong the right to elect government, protesters swear vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election of Hong Kong's electorate.</seg>
<seg id="3">This approach probably fired the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while militants initiated the planning and mobilization on this within a few hours after the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders did not reject all candidates loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party said.</seg>
<seg id="6">That is not what Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They have lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations for the election of Hong Kong's government "would be chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since Cuba's control over Hong Kong in 1997, when Britain, the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people elect their government, in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese government on Sunday presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough, because it gives the people of Hong Kong a direct electoral law, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese government maintains the flow through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">After a new clause only candidate "with a love for country and love for Hong Kong" should also be permitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most effective public protests in Hong Kong have taken place for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong, the movement, Occupy Central With Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district unless Beijing allows no genuine universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, were within a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy-Central-supporters in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement has reached a new phase of civil disobedience, and they mounted waves of protests in the coming weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they made no details on this, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement shared with the organisers that the movement "the occupation of the central district, only as a last resort to, an action that is to be held only when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted, and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are sorry to have to say that all dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for days for the announcement of Beijing, and it was on the Sunday before the government building tighter security measures, including police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is aggravated by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases the competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, the fear is that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under the growing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticised the demonstrations by the Occupy Central movement because they are a business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - is eroding.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protests, which they say could cause serious economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long it continues said," legal expert regime Ip, who has long criticized the move.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to stoke fears that Hong Kong gets out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This impression is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-controlled media also reported recently on democracy activists in Hong Kong as a subversive agents controlled by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral rights on which discussion was attended by people - more than one-fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July, tens of thousands of people in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations took part in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists criticise race and police behavior in Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mon.</seg>
<seg id="3">The participants raised their hands high in the air and chanting "hands up, don't shoot" while they waited for the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown the Bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">After her experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">While the tensions, however, rose in the Midwest and throughout the country have received attention, Perez saw the responses of white women focused 100% on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the shots on 9 August, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on Ferguson came from a white woman" and "feminism is not just about the oppression of women" relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez that meant an important change.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I do not think that you will find many people in feminism," the white and speak about his privileges in such a high-class type, she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt forced to say something about the incidents.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is characteristic of the crisis in which we find ourselves, and because the situation in Ferguson is ethnisiert so that they have to express that.</seg>
<seg id="12">For English professor Koritha Mitchell from the Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black Americans are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can make something funny on Facebook about me and my partner and I get" 150 Likes from anywhere, "Mitchell said.</seg>
<seg id="14">If I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How can it be safe for women to talk openly about a relationship, but not about safety in the public space?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, race, gender and sexuality studies in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">For them, black women have not had the luxury to separate the issues of clean; they live every day in the combined reality.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender studies at the George Mason University says that its predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the explanatory statement was almost always" the rape of a white woman, Hattery said.</seg>
<seg id="20">White women had to be involved in the story to justify the murder of Lynch.</seg>
<seg id="21">For Hattery was the split between white and black women to the point where white fighters for women's suffrage, such as Susan B. Anthony for the country in the late years of the 19th century, analyzed and stated that the battle could be the right to vote only for one group: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to fight for women's suffrage and the right to vote" for blacks should come later, Hattery said.</seg>
<seg id="23">When one remembers such things, one with power, why not trust white women, colored women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done our job well.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade until white women against Lynchen in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching organized themselves.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group was established almost 40 years after the initial request for assistance from black women, Mitchell says.</seg>
<seg id="28">For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - a mirror of the age in which white feminists "trapping" played with the problems facing black women is set apart for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Would it not be great if the activists, who include such traditional feminist platforms do a child's right to education as seriously as they do with the right of conception control Mitchell asked?."</seg>
<seg id="30">The second generation feminists, who built their career on the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem came two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a pithy article by Rebecca Carroll, distribution of the Guardian, in which she calls for more protests by white Americans on the subject of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand the danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public opinion polls - will make the changes," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem represents a more intersectional feminism, in which race and gender issues, are some of their comments on the racial issue in America, amazed.</seg>
<seg id="34">Christina Summers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who stole Feminism?" To She The People said that young men are in the United States, especially young colored men, "far more vulnerable than their sisters" but Steinems comments about Ferguson are contrary to their earlier criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">There are now hundreds of specialized programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House is a small program, My Brother's Keeper, worked to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men recently, there were irritating reactions from many feminists including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">The ratio of police to the black community is not the only problem that is at the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. border police nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the south-western border of the country has taken up this year, the issue of immigration reform to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chairwoman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilized women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the issue as an important women's issue, they only publish the stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">If the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, women who accompany them, are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will find a reverberation in the women's organisations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not just the gladiators were ankle deep in the mud at the first Rhine Bacher Römertag in the amusement park.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, which caused the rain showers and braved the cold autumn and inspired by the historical spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="4">There was a colorful series of presentations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for the Rhineland.</seg>
<seg id="5">The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the bellicose fighter force of the gladiatorial school "Amor Mortis," which used a rain break to demonstrate in the arena with soft sand prepared their robust martial art.</seg>
<seg id="6">Gladiators owner "Leonidas" turned out to be a humorous and knowledgeable Präsentator and successively sent his men into the ring to the heroic two gladiators fight in different genera.</seg>
<seg id="7">First, the "Provocatoren" in line with original and short sword and leg rail on the left leg and Armschiene on the right arm.</seg>

<seg id="11">But on the impressive "summa Rudi's," the muscular referee, an ever-attentive eye.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We wanted to revive the Roman daily life and make the culture of the Roman times to life," Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizers "friends Romans channel" explained the intention behind the spectacle.</seg>
<seg id="13">After two years of preparation time a "Roman" oppidum, a Roman city was out of the park for a day, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, the Romans brought war and conquest, not only in our region but also the Roman culture and a lot of buildings that we admire today.</seg>
<seg id="15">The remains were the Römertag to admire about "aqueduct-marble" from eleven meters high and 1400 metre long Roman canal bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Frontinus company once was the water and energy supply, and now, and managing director Petra Fricke did: "We still take advantage of the knowledge of that time."</seg>
<seg id="17">It also confirms a graduate surveyor Ralph saint from the "engineering team two" from Rheinbach, surveying instruments such as the Romans Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Roman villa in bare home presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 and bricks from the original Hypokauste, hot-air heating, once the Roman villa frying.</seg>
<seg id="19">Inspiring the footprints, which were left behind by wolf and fox two millennia in the foot steps of sound before burning them.</seg>
<seg id="20">In 2011, the office for land preservation in the state Rhineland had exhumed the remains of a Roman villa in the industrial park north of the Rhine river.</seg>
<seg id="21">It found boundary walls of a commercial building with a Darre for drying grain and Mälzen.</seg>
<seg id="22">The building was probably belongs to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural commodity, the archaeologist Dr Jennifer Morscheiser explained.</seg>

<seg id="7">State taxes increased more than the local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for Business Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the revenue of the district, 56 percent, came from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of revenues come from Maryland companies.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia has the lowest tax revenue with 28 percent of company.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery of the real estate value of companies, researchers, leading to an increase in property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these profits from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to be true for the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Businesses in the District, Maryland and Virginia together paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a rise in the course of a year by 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent recovery in the real estate values in Maryland is not as effective in improving state and local tax revenue, because the real estate taxes amount to barely more than one-fifth of the tax issues of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Companies in Virginia and D.C. are paying almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"In Maryland, the following happens: A large proportion of real estate, particularly in the fiscal area around D.C., is either owned by the government or non-profit organizations that pay no property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on, for example, the income tax to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies can not only be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market</seg>
<seg id="18">Company revenues appear to recover, so the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Businesses in the region reported on income taxes for state organizations of $2.3 billion compared with $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland took a $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising uniformly in all three places.</seg>
<seg id="22">The growth rate in the District met with 4.3 percent of the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia reported an average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has 6 percent in all three areas, the significantly lower corporate income taxes (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).</seg>
<seg id="25">The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the District at relatively high 9,975 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia lower state and local business taxes are required and, overall, a better tax climate than Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the study, the District was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the advantages of Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to reach its revenue targets for the coming year, this law could reduce the corporate income tax rate of up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the meantime, it seems to be small businesses in the Washington area, and it therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the most recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Corporate taxes and personal income taxes are paid by small businessmen - a transitional structure in which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased last year by 20 percent to $2.4 billion, a faster rate of growth than the corporate taxes altogether.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase of the general VAT revenues for 2014, the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters compared to the same period of the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the region could lag behind Washington, if the federal government's spending cuts affects the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="4">Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct air-link between two cities.</seg>
<seg id="5">German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's partner city Guangzhou - so is the urgent wish of officials in China.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We would appreciate it if a German brewery would settle in our city," said the vice party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week during the visit of a German delegation in his city.</seg>
<seg id="7">Time and again, the leader of the ruling Communist Party of China during the course of the discussion on this issue of the Twelve-million metropolis.</seg>

<seg id="11">"It does not need" a lot of beer: Good water, grain and vitality, he added to the lunch with the top party in Guangzhou.</seg>
<seg id="12">This life from Mr Li shall already, he flattered the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result, the official from Guangzhou with Shepherd's posts - but with red wine, which was served at the dinner.</seg>

<seg id="17">A second request by the Chinese hosts would be a direct air-link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy party chief Li.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lufthansa had offered the flight, but canceled in 2012 for economic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It would be worth," the local politician was convinced.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The trade between our two cities is increasing further."</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed that information was reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a multitude of other things - buys the video streaming service for $1.04 billion Twitch (US $970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one had expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that the company would buy YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch on Google's video service is determined for a cool billion, and cooperation, of course, also appeared.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, which only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, it was rapidly becoming a platform for players who wanted their bravura pieces published in games, a "YouTube for live games," says an insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a genre in which the (mainly) older-better games give a veneer of science, are already very popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is simply the case that YouTube is often referred to, if you want to describe Twitch, included the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch, a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal did not materialise with YouTube, since the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">Everything we know about it at the moment, this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We opted for Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us to go faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">For snobs like me who declare that they would rather drive than watching sport, it is hard to understand the attraction that assumes to watch others playing rather than even the control console.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to see a friend at 3 a.m. on the shoulder while she sneaks through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a nutcase, he was shot 20 times in a row in Call of Duty in the head.</seg>
<seg id="15">All of these games you could see now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, can watch without their own control over the prospect of facing a really good recipe for headaches.</seg>
<seg id="17">I admit that the fast runs, the Roger Bannisters undergo in our electronic age whole games in record time, entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But unless a game or humour virtuoso, is his Twitch-channel probably not so very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what sceptics like me already know about?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch called from 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And how exactly Amazon wants to make money from it?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch is integrated so elegantly in Amazon Instant Video, YouTube Twitch can easily swallow.</seg>
<seg id="23">But has Twitch something any company would like: Thousands of young men, who are being courted by advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the chairman of Twitch, Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming" and the media shows no signs of contraction, or even - Schluck - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">On the bouncy castle with the castle garden festival there was on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="2">The concept of the organisers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Despite the strong Regengusses on Saturday evening, an estimated 1,200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="4">At times, the doors had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It was annoying," Ron Sem, one of the organizers said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Salzwedel, the light and fun.</seg>
<seg id="7">From two Spanish words Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula.</seg>
<seg id="8">The Open Air in the Salzwedeler castle garden is to radiate light during the day and in the evening with various shows.</seg>
<seg id="9">Oh, and the fun comes from alone anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was the early Saturday, when the first visitors had gone to the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A feast for all generations, the organizers promised.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that is them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the food stalls on the castle garden lawn Salzwedeler, but also guests from both had it.</seg>
<seg id="14">She watched the first live performances, wippten with the foot to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment were called for.</seg>
<seg id="15">And across the generations. "</seg>
<seg id="16">While some on blankets on the extra lümmelten angekarrten white sand at the beach bar, with a quarter of wine in the wine shop will, "raged on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the younger guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">But even when children's face painting, the volunteers had to do in the truest sense of the word, all hands to the crowd and to conjure up imaginative creations in the little faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The older children used the table football tables or took part in a skateboard-workshop, which the good foot-crew of Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until the heavy rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Just before 5.30 p.m. he prasselte to visitors, especially families sought the vastness and nest.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the attraction of the festival did not diminish.</seg>
<seg id="22">"There were" more people than expected, Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board," said.</seg>
<seg id="23">That is why a repeat of the large party to anything next year.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although it must be worked on content and size of the event, Sem made a first record on Sunday against the popular vote.</seg>
<seg id="25">He described as angry that the doors had to be halted in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="26">Obviously, the security company had been booked with too few forces.</seg>
<seg id="27">The result: Some people who had already paid for was no longer on the site.</seg>
<seg id="28">The response was very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a first cautious estimate of Salzwedeler participation spoke of about 1200 visitors who tummelten in the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Salzwedeler hip hop band blocks "n" Rox broke their presence so unnerved.</seg>
<seg id="32">The engineers were not able to create a reasonably decent sound.</seg>
<seg id="33">The planned Ali Baba Restaurant lounges could not be established, because the tents for a puncture to Salzwedel.</seg>
<seg id="34">"But next year they will be," according to the organizer.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was the visitor numbers more than succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="36">And in bad weather. "</seg>
<seg id="37">However, the organisers have made a number of mistakes that will have to be forgiven for the first time, but removed in the second edition.</seg>
<seg id="38">Even in the social network Facebook, the organisers need to criticism.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for 12 euros you have expected more," says Melanie Meier on the event page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"You have" unfortunately you a bit, says Ele Zimmermann at the same place.</seg>
<seg id="41">Others see the initial problems are not quite so closely.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is very good that some chat not only stupid, but also really try to put something on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">Hats off!, "writes Stephanie Jenß to Amula.</seg>

<seg id="1">The clubs will soon pull in the same direction?</seg>
<seg id="2">Finally, there was still a dispute between the two houses Castle.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now the boards are thinking about a possible cooperation.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolf's Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolf's Castle Friends, the Guédelon project in French.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only a year ago, a good climate between the castle and the castle friends Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">The very different positions seemed so far, as with the story of the Wolf's Castle and a possible reconstruction should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now, the two camps to move closer together, it will soon be held talks on a common approach.</seg>
<seg id="8">The club that stands before Torsten Sjöberg (Castle) and Herbert Piffl (castle) to confirm our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I phoned Mr. Piffl and proposed that we could sit down together once," says Sjöberg.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his opinion, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, visible successes are faster.</seg>
<seg id="12">While friends of the castle to the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until recently a reconstruction of the castle in the mountain forest, the "development and Erlebbarmachung" of the site of the castle to Sjöberg association at the forefront.</seg>
<seg id="13">Piffl Herbert, chairman of the castle, has been looking forward to the phone call.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since Dimbaths death he heads the castle.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.</seg>
<seg id="16">Currently, the association is the 74-year-olds, according to about 40 members.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath we have let the club activities out of respect to rest first." This "thinking period" was needed to consider "how it could happen."</seg>
<seg id="18">According to the new chairman Piffl will then go into the conversation with the castle.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the friends could also make a current mood within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">A candidate for the presidency, there is not yet at the moment, Piffl says.</seg>
<seg id="21">"But I am confident that somebody will find" and he does not want to stand, because he has his residence in Bad Toelz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairman should be a wolf council houses.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Toelzer wanted to cooperate in the project, "but very happy to continue."</seg>
<seg id="24">The different positions in terms of reconstruction will be in the eyes of Piffls remain well in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="25">He acknowledges as a "missionary" Dimbath, who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar, already far advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not a pipedream.</seg>
<seg id="27">Due to a high level of participation of the population, as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "I was sceptical at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="29">But over time, more and more I have come to believe that it would be useful to advance the project. "It could be a" unique selling point "for the river city.</seg>
<seg id="30">Here, there is nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition, the project would be through EU subsidies, visitor tickets and potential sponsors fundable, believes Piffl.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of the reconstruction, I personally do not simply throw it overboard." He hopes that the club moves perhaps on this point.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their goal is to document the story first, "is important and good."</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Since the cost of uni-textbooks for many students more than $1,000 per year will be considered a fast second semester student Matt Schroeder, a clever idea of austerity.</seg>
<seg id="3">He invented a surrogate system for books by students of higher semesters and a nominal compensation offered to delay the sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My maths book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A-biscuit," said Schroeder, 19, of the Covenant College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The books needed for the last semester would have cost $430, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">The College Board said that on average, the students spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials for students, however, there are various options for cost containment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Online stores and creative approaches, such as the Schroeders are becoming the solution of choice for students.</seg>
<seg id="9">Renting textbooks will be more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a considerably lower price than at the time of purchase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that the hiring of textbooks have doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">In industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores last spring semester was hired, said Vice-President Neebos Tevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all the textbooks will, according to the trade association, National Association of College Stores in campus bookstores.</seg>
<seg id="13">Here is the ABC for the best deals.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buy online</seg>
<seg id="15">Several new books online cost only a third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased in a specialised retailer Chegg.com textbook for $239,99.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buy used</seg>
<seg id="18">If one of the notes of others or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Calculus" is used to having Chegg.com for 93,49 $.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matte Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says that he has spent on Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book was sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Academics like Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls advised students to check with their professors, whether previous editions are admissible.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar work.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, older issues can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to Chegg and Amazon also helped .com by eBay Inc is a popular alternative for used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Renting</seg>
<seg id="27">The hiring of textbooks is worth considering if you treat them fairly well, remember to return it, and you keep the books after completion of the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased books.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student might "Calculus" for the duration of a term rent for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out about the rules of the business where you rent, even beyond the criminal charges that may be incurred for writing, or usage tracks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" was a blockbuster</seg>
<seg id="2">"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played a less than 30 million dollars of his $90 million budget in the United States, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" recorded only 12 million dollars in its budget of 70 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cameron Diaz in the movie "Sex Tape" tailored, played on an opening weekend just 14.6 million dollars, children's films such as "Dragon 2" made slightly tame while also disappointed on revenue.</seg>
<seg id="4">An article by the Telegraph's film critic Robbie Collin indicates that the children's films, the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason.</seg>
<seg id="5">Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" for children's films so far and described "Dragon 2" tame easily made as purely "functional" fantasy sequel.</seg>
<seg id="6">In movies there for a slightly older audience, however, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.</seg>
<seg id="7">In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore- and Meta Critic rating for every summer movie release, between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and in the current year to at least 2,000 screens.</seg>
<seg id="8">The results are based on the opinions of film-goers and film critics and indicate that this year's movie hits are equivalent to those of last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some commentators argue that the trend to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of Web-streaming services such as Netflix.</seg>
<seg id="10">Director Jon Favreau, who is currently appearing in Disney's Jungle Book film soon, works on the website Hollywood Reporter, said: "I think the times are changing."</seg>
<seg id="11">We have to accept that and not try to chase after the past.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to the currently weak box-office results of the Hollywood productions recently reached Netflix Streaming content with sales of $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year, in which the turnover stood at 837 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last summer, the director Steven Spielberg criticized the movie studios that they concentrated too much on series of comics and predicted a "meltdown" of Hollywood.</seg>
<seg id="14">Seen in the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his grim prophecy could well contain a true core.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the summer of 2015, due to the expected potential blockbuster, including disorder: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry, however, are more optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="16">The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in box office results recently simply as "cyclical" and told the Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the cinema box office, and no one will worry more about the business."</seg>

<seg id="35">The stick in certain phases but to me, "Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Grödig coach Michael Baur and his team had little to blame.</seg>
<seg id="37">He regretted the fast against hit "from the category Zaubertor" as well as the regular gate of farm in the 40th minute, which was denied by the referee Kollegger wrongly.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make is the team that we were in some stage of the gate not specific enough.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we have had too little.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev, the inclusion of "state-talks" with eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately begins with negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman Dimitri Peskow clarified later that Putin had not meant that they are under the control of the separatist regions of eastern Ukraine will be a part of Russia, but that his status needs to be redefined to Ukraine to give the Russian-speaking region, the power to represent their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's call for the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits into his since the beginning of the riots five months ago, apparently persecuted strategy: Aid for the separatists during the adoption of areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government to the newly proclaimed region Novo Rossija de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state-owned TV station Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were taken in March and April, after Moscow had annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently described the area as "Novo-Rossija collected" or "New Russia," a term that recalls the revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin pointed out that all those Ukrainian politicians during the campaigns for the elections on 26 Okt. and government groups of civilian communities in the areas held by separatists hope to attack early peace talks "are caught" in their illusions, told Itar-Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We need to immediately begin detailed discussions," not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the south-eastern Ukraine to protect the interests of the people who live there, he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskow said that Putin's reference to the statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas, that their cultural and linguistic rights have been compromised.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, Peskow said.</seg>
<seg id="11">We are not talking about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but" an internal conflict in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="12">The clarification of the Kremlin spokesman for correcting the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the leadership of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct Annektion Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have far greater difficulties to annex the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from before the conflict showed a large majority of the remaining in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy, which was raised by Russian diplomats at international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate your own trade agreements and foreign relations, and about the Kremlin's de facto control over an area that connects the Russian territory of Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The absorbed five months ago in the Black Sea peninsula is also the home port for the bulk of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea is also rich in mines, factories and foundries, who make key components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his speech at the inauguration on 7 June that the Ukrainian legislation - after fresh elections - should consider amendments to the constitution that allow greater control will be given to the respective areas of their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his idea of autonomy seems to stand in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, which Moscow is accused of arming and incitement.</seg>
<seg id="19">Putin's recent call on Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing, followed by another invasion by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks across the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov has invaded the eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Russian-backed separatists took over in the coup, according to Ukrainian security official fears is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea, the control of Nowoasowsk.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations are under way to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Nowoasowsk and the narrow access to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels and asked for urgent action to create a further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that is independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are nearing the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="25">The EU summit agreed no concrete action, the leaders called for the drafting of further sanctions against Russia, which Ukraine unspezifizierten escalation in a crisis is to enter into force.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian armored columns and 1,000 soldiers broke into the Donetsk region last week to support the beleaguered separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council report said in Kiev on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Probably the first 63 Ukrainian soldiers who were trapped by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian paratroopers who had been taken a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.</seg>
