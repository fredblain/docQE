Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought that they would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost its entire youth in the belief that they are only a few years after they had been diagnosed with the disease.
It was indeed Charcot-Marie-tooth disease (CMT) - a group ererbter disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and the spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that false diagnoses are a common problem for people with CMT, because so little is known about the disease.
About 23.000 people in Britain are likely to lead to the CMT, motor disorders such as Muskelschwäche, an uncertain and gekrümmten Zehen.
Ill also suffer from numbness or pain, and the disease is progressive and incurable, which means that by the time the symptoms get worse.
As Rodgers 13, it was believed that they Friedreich's ataxia (IAs) have - a disease with very poor survival.
Rodgers thought they would sit in a wheelchair, before they were 18, and die before their 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is 51 years old today, said: "As a child I knew that I could not do the same as the others.
I fell steadily and it took longer for me.
I could never go with the other children skating or skateboard and was often in school because of my way to go and run gehänselt.
Rodgers said that they realised their medical records at the age of 13 years after several operations to the discharge of their Achilles and stretching their legs, when her doctor had left the room and read that they suffered from IAs.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I told this to anyone, but I went home and was looking for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA-society," she said.
I received a reply, I was shocked and got terribly in panic.
I thought that I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and 25 die, and lose all my skills would slowly in between.
I was all alone with me and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she was 17, it was clear that their skills had not fallen as much as they had imagined and questioned their doctor.
He stood up and took me and said, 'I love, I do not believe that you would have otherwise you already in the wheelchair'.
I believe that you have something far less lebensbedrohliches.
After some genetic tests, was found at the CMT.
``when he said that what was CMT, I felt as if I were a winner, ''she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT-Awareness-month, to draw attention to this disease.
