Tax burden of businessmen in Washington, with the economic recovery
The recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for companies in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated in the past week, and the companies in the Washington area, according to a newly published study were no exception.
Companies in the area of District, Maryland and Virginia paid together 27,6 billion dollars to state and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8% compared with the revenue from 2012 to the tune of $600 billion.
The state and local tax burden of businesses rose last year by 4.3% to EUR 671 million, compared to 3.9% in the year before, and it was the third consecutive Wachstumsjahr after several years of declining orders in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than the local taxes, 4.3%, so the study carried out by the National Centre for taxation, a Steuerpolitikgruppe from Dienstleistungsagentur Ernst & Young.
More than half of the District, 56%, revenue comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Mary's revenues come from businesses.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from businesses, with 28 percent.
A large proportion of the increase in revenue is founded the company in a recovery of Immobilienwerte, researchers, leading to an increase in the Immobiliensteuern by 3.7% this year for the three successive years with a growth rate of less than 1%.
While a large proportion of these profits for large states like California, New York and Texas, is of course also applies to the area of Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes together last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase in the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in the real estate values is not as effective in the increase of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as in the real estate taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of corporate tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and DC pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of Immobiliensteuern.
On 509.719 '490.305, 28.872 in Maryland 419.306 is the following: a large part of the property, 381.955 352.001, 70.352, 58.838, particularly in the field of taxation on 28.261 to DC is either 267.811, 128.668, 61.645, 40.822 on 17.375 in possession of the government or 14.597 of non-profit organisations, the pay on 14.334 57.539 not Immobiliensteuern on 29.285, ``said on 113.582, 26.995, Douglas Lindholm, 81.218, managers for the 49.154, Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, to be able to offer the same services that offer other states.
The recent recovery in tax revenues by companies cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the property market
Unternehmenseinnahmen seem to recover the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes in Staatsorganisationen of 2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
During the trend in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies in all three areas.
The growth rate was significantly higher in the District corresponded with the national average of 4.3 percent, while the increase in Maryland, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a unterdurchschnittliches tax revenue from 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income taxes (in all three with 6 percent in all three areas, there are strong business rates).
The corporate tax rate from 8.25 percent in Maryland and the District at relatively high 9,975 percent.
A similar study at the beginning of this year, the US Chamber of Commerce showed that lower state and local business taxes will be required in Virginia and a total of a better tax climate than in Maryland.
In the study of the District was not investigated.
Despite the advantages, Virginia has been under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to reduce its corporate tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the government continues to his Einkommensziele next year, could reduce this law by 2017 up to 3% of the Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz of the state.
In the meantime, there seems to be better off small businesses in Washington, and they are therefore more state and local taxes, as the recent study.
Taxes paid by small businessmen as personal income taxes - a Ãœbergangsstruktur, organised under the most small businesses - in the District, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% in the last year to EUR 2.4 billion dollars, a faster rate than the taxation as a whole.
The researchers say that the trend and the increase in corporate taxes across the country will probably continue in this year, with an increase of general VAT revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
However, if the spending cuts by the federal government has an impact on the labour market in the region, the Washington area could lag behind.
