Lenny Henry: my father has never in the arm.
Never said ``I love you ''
Henry was one of seven children of a family Jamaica Cuban immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father died when he was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The Soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with lively Melodien.
But Henry had to work through some difficult Kindheitsmomente.
He went to ``many ''therapies, following the death of his mother, and Henry is thought about his relationship with his father.
It was difficult to know him.
We never saw his face, only to hear his voice: 'listen to the noise.
Let your sister in peace and quiet.
Beweg you!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up, when I was a child - went with him in the pub and talked about things, such as the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had such a conversation with him.
A large part of my life, he was the serious type in the corner of the newspaper.
Recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at the time of his father, Henry won it with an insight into how life may have been for him.
It is high time, but they are dark verraucht, deep stygische maze with Flammenstößen and smoke and soot.
My father was simply earlier in the tub and then you could hear him slowly, as he began to sing, because he could wash the foundry.
When I went around there, I realized that he had done so for years, in order to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him has been growing.
However, Henry grew without stuff of love to his parents as a child.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when it is my mother at the end of their life is bad, we started, ``I love you, I love you, I love you ''.
Through his own daughter Billie, Dawn French, he disappeared as a child he had to share the love.
Could you let's stop with the "I love you"?
But to listen to hug me!
Dad, I am 22.
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
It is a great mother.
It is with which he married 25 years was friends with French.
Dawn is a good one.
Why should we not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henrys own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I was very, very overweight and symptoms of diabetes, said my doctor'you must be radically.
So I moved through this thing and has also had to make a drastic diet, in order to reverse the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And it is demanding.
No one is happy to eat carrots.
Henrys Karrierewechsel is perhaps in its elegant, kurzgeschnittenen Bart.
Since he was praised by critics for his masterpiece, he is captured by the theater.
It was followed by The comedy of errors, and then fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started with only 16 years, when he was working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage, when he wrote persons and imitation of New Faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator / comedian on television for a very long time."
He got in the profession.
I had to not only be large in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985, as I could be an effective jokes-narrative-machine, while I was a star on television, and it was really difficult.
Lenny in 1975 in New Faces
As the Bühnenrecht managers in the Black and White Minstrel Show '', had a slight Unterhaltungsprogramm in which people'black anmalten, led his musical comedy Henry there about five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
Somehow, I wish that it would never happen, but I regret that I have done it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on Riesenprojekten and knew how to deal with a large audience.
But this' years of prize-winning easy pillar of the British television'was also a bizarre parody of black people'.
With the introduction of characters, which celebrated the British black culture as both a mock, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circuit in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Black lock in the comedy series leader, among other things.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and movie roles characterized his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008 he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because everything feels like, when you're only time rum or join a little bit on the spot."
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About...?
The first consequence was to Shakespeare.
I was downright allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never right in the school learned something about him and held him for a domain of the middle class, whites in tights and a cabbage at the front.
So I had great fear.
All that we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it again.
Please do not bad, if you do not know what you redest.
Put a couple of words in the mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.
Henry on led 20 lines from Othellos last speech for the documentary and he was excited.
I had the feeling that I was able to do this.
It was almost as if someone had his head finally set up correctly.
``therefore, it is a serious matter, take it seriously lern your text, a recherchiere bit.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we made it.
And it was a success.
It seemed to be an accident, and this happened.
And soon joined in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a time when I thought, 'Oh, you have changed you'.
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me" You must now bridge 10 minutes while the computer repair. ""
Instead of Bühnenleiter announced that the idea of opening, as soon as the problem solved.
I was on the scene and something I said'Oh, thank God'.
I am not responsible for this.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry the Duchess Theatre in Fences
To learn the text for Fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens tendons.
It also sold well, so it is like a large sign of the gods that I say, 'This is your destiny. ""
He says that, of course, with a dramatic voice.
So I will say it.
I love it.
I love to be in a rehearsal room.
Henry but still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is crossed by humorous outbreaks, while he repeatedly people imitated.
I have decided to make a stand-up comedy, because I think that this kind of immediate gratification of a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If that is so, it all goes against a wall.
I am sometimes live at the Apollo, if I want it, but overall, I am not as much as before.
I ask him whether he will ever make another stand-up comedy tour.
The fun that I was in a room with a director who helps to shape a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I do not believe that I would ever give up again.
This is the new personification?
I think so.
I am an actor.
It is fun.
We always tells a story, and it is great.
I love stories.
The people love stories.
