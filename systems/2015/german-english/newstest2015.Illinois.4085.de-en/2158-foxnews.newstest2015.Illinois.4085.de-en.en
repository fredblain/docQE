4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you like to make photographs or videos under water, there is a choice of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver edition, both of which are to be had for about $300.
I have these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other subjects are densely closed.
Set your camera on the photos or videos that you want to capture.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scenes and recording sessions with which the exposure time is optimized for the dämmrigen underwater conditions.
And before you jump, you will see to what extent your equipment is operational.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others by 50 or 60 feet.

Take multiple shots, because many will not be achieved.
Point-and-shoot cameras usually do not have a flat, with which you can compose images, action-cams.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to see this under water, and the right attitude is a matter of chance.
So make many recordings.
If your camera has a terraced mode, in which a number of shots are made with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light will be dramatically worse, the further you remove themselves from the surface.
If possible you should stay so close to the surface, if you recordings in a pool, a lake or sea.
You can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less you will see color.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good Council under water, but it is all the more important because of the bad there.
It is particularly important, if you are working with a Action-Cam: this equipment often have a fixed Weitwinkellinse, which means that you are close to your objects, if they have to fill in the whole Bildrahmen.
