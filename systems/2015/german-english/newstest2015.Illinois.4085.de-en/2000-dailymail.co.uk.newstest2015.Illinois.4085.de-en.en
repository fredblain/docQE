The Höllenjahrzehnt the survivors of Beslan: ten years as the verstrickten children are still suffering, since the dreadful siege of the school.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants in a school in Beslan in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, have been in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific school siege in Beslan in which 334 people were killed, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As a fanatical Islamic terrorists children and parents on 1 September 2004, the beginning of a new this academic year, were caught and killed, this seemed like the repudiate the evil.
The tragedy brought together West and East in disgust, and then turned surprisingly in action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in order to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of bestiality in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will pursue it forever.
Their best hope?
The war of Ukraine now exists - and in which children are dying - as they are now coming to an end.
The girl, which was photographed in the attempt, in the age of school sports hall singer
She was photographed by the Russian Star photographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous, when she was only in her underwear, was in the age of school sports hall singer, after a mine exploded.
Completely confused Aida sought after her mother Larissa, 40 years old.
Both were thought to be dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me that I should run for my life, but I could not," Aida said at the time.
My legs were blood flow.
I stood up and kletterte again to look after my mother.
It was a soldier in safety.
After a series of operations, it is completely healed, but said yesterday: ``Before three months returned the pain.
I am afraid that I must again be operated on.
Some Granatsplitter are still in my knees.
Their goal is now to be a dentist, in order to help the people, as she was helped by doctors.
This tragedy has changed my life, but it has not been, ``says they pugnacious.
"This has happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I always stayed in the gym to remind me of it there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it, on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together, as we were small and dreamt of them to go to school.
"I do not want to marry until I finish my studies and my career start.
In a family I think later.
It says that the siege remain a part of it, even though the memory of each year is rather weak.
I am glad that many people in the world, to our horror and we are grateful for the support of people in Britain and anywhere.
When I see the photo online of me, as I understand our disaster in the school zurückklettere I think that many people see it for the first time, and to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy, who fled by bullets, in the view that his mother is dead
It was his first day (Russians go with seven years in the school) and Tamara survived the three-day siege in his mother's arms.
As seven years, he said, "mom told me that I should get me if there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion he thought that they would die.
She said to him: ``flow ''.
Full of fear, they could be dead, he was on the road and a little bit of sadness baby, took it in the hand and, through a bullets.
His father, Vladimir, into the arms of his son out there, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said: "I could not save them."
In fact, Tamara outside stumbled with leg injuries in the hospital, for their part in the assumption that her son died.
After reunification she said: 'I wept with joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (of the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), in order to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is following you every day, but I wish I could stop with the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it pale in my memory.
I know that I immediately all my Spielzeugpistolen wegwarf.
But now I can play games with Schussszenen and this is not a problem for me.
``I am not afraid to go back into the Sporthalle, but I do not think about myself.
I remember these children, with whom I have played in the yard, and have not made it to the outside world.
We never say that they have been killed or are dead.
We say that they are stuck in the gym.
I remember my trip to London, particularly in the toy shop, where I was able to choose everything very well what I wanted, and the ride in an open top car.
But now he has suffered a fear of the ground, such as Ukraine, where wars are the kind of accident that he and his friends.
This horror followed you every day, but I wish I could stop.
``am so sorry for all those who are suffering under the answer, ''said Damir, last week as a volunteer in a monastery.
I want to help so much.
I will one day go to the police and hope that they will take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: ``37 children have been killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
I remember the appalling silence the siege, there was simply no children, the call and walk, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly on their trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood at the time, as people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, and show their support.
It was Cherie and its Foundation grateful for the price and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call their own Cherie and simply say that, 10 years have passed, but I remember the meetings I have her and her husband in London are still, and as the Damir and helped me.
I still remember how Damir Borschtsch to eat and all local Russian restaurants experience.
I remember, as he played in a restaurant with Kellnern. Damir fired with its Wasserpistole to them and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just one month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British people are so willing to our pain and are supported.
She said: 'I believe that the world has become more in these ten years.
In Ukraine, the war now again, and people die every day, and I believe that many children were killed and still be killed.
These are precisely such children as ours.
I think that, for many of the war, a piece of news is that they hear bored or if it deals with something else.
I know just what these people feel the horror.
Do not stop this and I can feel.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that is so sad.
Damir was large and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, it is not for revenge, he is the last answer overwhelmed.
I know that he does not like to remember, but he has six close friends in the class and sometimes they go into the Sporthalle, candles and light.
When he was smaller, he including - I remember how he sometimes on the SOFA, the face of us away, for hours.
Not schlafend, his eyes were open.
I still remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys away. - is now 17, bigger than I, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that, for a few hours, I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I am a following the explosion and the legs came, I saw, and saw the hell around me, with all herumliegenden body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell impossible have survived.
``I remember that I shouted at him'Damir, lauf, lauf away '', but I was sure that he had not heard me.
But it has one and it is weggelaufen.
And so it goes on life, unlike many others, for us.
Let Ilyin, 17
The boy, the terrible image after the siege of the symbol of the outrage of Beslan was
Comfort: The 2004 Beslan-survivor Georgy Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege, on a picture of born today
Be blutüberströmtes face was marked by fear, as he Chechen terrorists his Klassenkameraden niederschossen, running his life.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarity of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had it before they came to get rid of the University of their older son Vladimir, sold on his first day.
``I left the farm about two minutes, the terrorists stormed before him, and so was my little boy for three terrible days alone, 'it remembers.
Not quite alone, there was a whole family of relatives from us, but all of them have been killed.
I let only managed to survive.
As the date, the more difficult it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day on which we remind ourselves of this tragedy.
We do not think that it is a long time ago, I think it would be a few scenes from these days I have always done yesterday.
No one will ever forget that, I assure you.
Urgent: The image of born (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as statue (right).
I wanted to remember that born on this day are so happy to go to school, he said that he wants to embrace his teacher.
I knew that it was, as I saw it on television.
And now there are even this statue of weinenden let in San Marino.
Born does not like the image, and it is hidden at home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that people around the world feel our pain, thanks to this image.
Born today says: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People investigate such tragedies again and again and never learned the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of the Boeing in Ukraine.
We will know what caused it?
The horror of this world.
I cannot understand how it is possible, because if you ask the people, nobody wants a war, so how is this happening?
Ten years is nothing in such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget a little.
It has attacked my health and I am still.
About three or four years I had a couple of nightmares because of the siege, but then it was better.
I was later in the year 2004 and was back to school every day.
I thought of my friends and Klassenkameraden who have been killed.
On 114.445 therefore I am always 26.802 in the Sporthalle, has if now on 1 September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends of mine.
It is difficult for me to go to the gym, but I must do it.
I am not as victims, this story is now a part of my past.
I will not forget bemitleide, but I am not.
My life goes on.
I have concluded the school this year and visit a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I shall be Herzchirurg.
My first choice was an education in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health has not.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that will not happen.
Let Fanijew, 20
The boy, who survived, although he caught at the feet of a murderous terrorists
A miracle: Georgy Fanijew was caught during the siege at the foot of a murderous terrorists, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the gym and sat beside the bomb, which was attached at the foot of a murderous terrorists.
It is actually a miracle that he was not killed.
``we feel as if it was yesterday, saying, 'let's go to the FSB as Geheimdienstoffizier wanted, but because of his health damage due to the siege could do it.
It is still with me, there is nothing that I have left behind me.
I am now older and people say that children can easily cope with terrible experience - I must say that this is not true.
``in 2006, I worked with psychologists and felt that something better, but I can not forget.
And I would like to forget.
In 2005, a year later, was the first and only time I went back in the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return, and please do not ask me where I sat in this famous picture to show you.
Survivor: let Fanijew today, with a photograph of the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is extraordinary and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I do not like to think and talk and they asked me never to the school.
Physically, it is good to me.
I should be very careful with my injured knees, but I can now well under way.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have submitted my papers, including the medical and they have responded that it was not possible.
My second passion were the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all animals' of cats to cows'.
He said: "I knew that I would tell my children never in my experience.
Should children know nothing and it should not, of course, also suffer.
His mother Marina, 42, said, 'This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse, if the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations in his memory.
I know that born will not go.
It must be even more intense for him, because he was there and I do not.
I was at home at him and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me, and all of them are drawn in Beslan.
It remains in us.
Let is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It is difficult to accept that, if a little so Unfaires experience.
He is a boy, he may sport, but it can not be due to its knees.
He was operated on several occasions, he can run, but no sport.
I would like to see it resolved the horror to 50%, but that cannot be overcome and never completely forgotten.
This terrible experience will follow.
Many friends and neighbours were killed during the siege and the only my pain.
I am I knew well and dear to me, many people have been lost.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart cries for the slain.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows, never married again.
It is difficult to accept that life goes on, even if it does not want.
I would like my heart jumped in me when I saw him in hospital.
And now, I see what is happening in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now very close to our country and I cannot believe almost.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine, and many more are being killed.
If we take all these rebels, but, as far as possible.
