After election in Saxony, CDU-Vice Strobl, NPD-closure case into
Given the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony CDU-Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl has called for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure in the constitutional court.
Berlin - According to the CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl should the current Verbotsverfahrens find an end to the Federal Constitutional Court against the National Democratic Party.
"The NPD performs worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also the CDU-country chief in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the Leipziger Volkszeitung. "
This is a welcome development in the right direction and a development that makes me come to the conclusion that the NPD fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD has been very close to the five-percent hurdle in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt for a ban on the extreme right-wing party was because the Verfassungsschutz at that time in the NPD-tip informers had failed in 2003.
In December 2013, the Federal Council after a long preparation filed a new request in Karlsruhe.
Federal government and parliament joined.
