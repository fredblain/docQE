Harburg tents for new refugees.
The Neul√§nder place refugees are now housed in tents.
The initial reception of refugees in Harburg bursts bursting at the seams.
Now the inner authority has set up three tents of the Red Cross in addition.
The Bezirkspolitiker were informed until shortly before they are less enthusiastic.
Stir up these pro-active action to the citizens' concerns and give the Bezirkspolitikern no possibility'of the humane accommodation of refugees to be constructive, says about Britta Herrmann, chairman of the Greens in the Harburger Bezirksversammlung.
Their demands that the Bezirksverwaltung Harburg currently unused houses on the accommodation available.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the influx of hilfesuchenden - and the fact that the authorities do not provide enough seats in Folgeeinrichtungen.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
