Going back to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
The Congress Keith Ellison and John Lewis, have the right to establish the organisation of trade unions, tabled a legislative proposal.
', such as trade unions, die die the Mittelklassejobs, ``said Ellison, Caucus a democrat in Minnesota and Vice-Chairman of the Congressional in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud of that, together with the Bürgerrechtsikone John Lewis the Mitarbeiterermächtigungsgesetz.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options with discrimination because of the organization of trade unions and other forms of discrimination - and stops set so anti-union forces.
The addition of national Arbeitsrechtsgesetzes, to organise a union representation to create an opportunity for a discrimination abandoned workers in order to complain about justice before a civil court - and to receive compensation or Strafgelder - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not to American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of the bill suggest the link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks in recent years, the trade unions - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country, Americans will extend to comply with labour rights and encourage countries all over the world.
There was a time in which millions of Americans, as this country is democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the freedom of association in one breath.
When the United States after the Second World War, Japan had occupied, General Douglas' Arthur and his staff, which ensure the country to adopt a Constitution that the militarised autocracy Hedki Tojos replaced by democracy.
In full awareness of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that are explicitly recognized that guarantees workers' rights of association and collective bargaining and action. "
When the United States occupy Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pushed the Germans, to write a constitution that would ensure that the fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that the workers have to organise themselves, and their voice heard in the new nation, a German added a clause which explicitly aussagte: 'the right to safeguard the employment and economic conditions and to improve to form associations, individuals and guaranteed any trade or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to diminish it are null and void; measures aimed to are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Commission on Human Rights, designed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as it was taken over by the United Nations as a global agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect its interests or to join them."
Since generations the Americans accept the basic premise that labour rights are human rights.
As other countries in this country, as we build civil and democratic societies, told Americans that the right of trade unions to the creation and protection - that this trade union will participate as an equal partner with companies and government agencies in collective bargaining it should.
After these rights in America come under attack, it is actually very wise to lead the American ideal in mind that working people must have the right to unite and to make themselves heard in a free and open society.
Fifty years ago, as Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said:
The story is a great teacher.
We all know that the workers' movement, the strength of the nation, but not increased.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for the industry and the nation as a whole increased to unimaginable levels of production.
Forget those who attack the work these simple truths, but they kept the story.
The story recalls, and we should do this.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights and protection against discrimination in the creation of employees' representatives, is long overdue.
Renew Keith Ellison and John Lewis the ideals that America has made in the past, and the promise of democracy einlösten.
