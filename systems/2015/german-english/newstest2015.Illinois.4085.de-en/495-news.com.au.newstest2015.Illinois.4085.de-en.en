Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
Amazon has just confirmed, as reported information on Monday morning: the online retailers and Videoproduzent, and a number of other things, buy the Videostreamingdienst Twitch for 1.04 billion dollars (970 million US $).
The announcement is not surprising, because no one expects a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely assumed that YouTube buy the company.
Three months ago, it looked as if the sale of Twitch decided to Google's video service for a cool billion. The cooperation also appeared, of course.
Twitch it was founded as a Justin.tv only three years ago, was a Live-version of YouTube - launched as a general Streamingdienst.
Instead, it was' a platform for players, who published their Bravourst√ºcke in games, a'YouTube for live games, so an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre, in the opinion of the (mostly older) games give a veneer of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is precisely that YouTube is often called, if you want to describe Twitch, so was the news that YouTube Twitch wanted to buy a little bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitors.
A mystery to me why the deal with YouTube did not come about because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as it is Amazon.
Everything that we know at the moment is Emmet Twitch sheer, President of this statement: "We have decided on Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster."
Another mystery is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say that they prefer to watch a sport, it is difficult to understand the attraction, the assumption that others watching the games themselves to take the control console in the hand.
It is one thing to see a friend at 3 o'clock in the morning on the shoulder while they trailed by resident Evil, and quite another to watch a spinner as 20 times in a row in Call of Duty is shot in the head.
All of these games, you could see it now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games are ego games today, so the watch without control over the look of their own perspective can be a good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick passes, all of our electronic age in the Roger Bannisters complete games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as not a game or Humorvirtuose is Twitch-channel is probably not so very interesting.
But what sceptics as I know it?
Twitch is called of 55 million of visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internetverkehrsspitzen.
And exactly how to make money from Amazon?
It is hard to imagine that Twitch so elegantly integrated into Amazon instant Video, such as YouTube Twitch simply could swallow.
But Twitch has something that each company would like: Thousands of young men to be courted as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, shear, said, 'both Twitch Amazon and believe in the future of the Gaming, ``and the medium shows no signs of contraction, not even - Schluck - as a spectator sport.
