Israeli children return back to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas in the vicinity of the Gaza Strip returned back to the schools on Monday, after they had spent the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar fire went down to their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the schools remained closed, while the area is recovering from the fighting.
The Schulstart expressed by Raketeneinschusslöchern torn communities in southern Israel a feeling of joy and expectation, but the signs of the fighting is still fresh.

"We have a little bit of fear, but are excited," said Ronit Bart, Anwohnerin in the caves of Saad and local English teacher.
Many children in our area urgently need a return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it felt "a bit strange" suddenly to go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we have not even gone out of the house," she said.
President Johns Hopkins researchers Rivlin visited the caves near the border with Gaza, in order to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire in the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to safer areas further removed from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Ein Oz, a town near the border with Gaza, a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still with the return.
The Ministry of Education said, about a dozen families is not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, visited a school in Sderot, the Palestinian attack on Gaza, a border town.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, 'we will ensure that their knowledge erwerbt and offer you security'.
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday a unbefristeteten cease-fire.
The cease-fire, for an immediate end to the fighting, important problems remain unresolved, such as the requirement of Hamas for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel is calling for the disarmament of Hamas and the transfer of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians have been killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children according to estimates of the Palestinians and the United Nations.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed by militants, presented, however, no concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a thailändischer workers, killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4.591 rockets and mortar shells at Israeli cities during the fighting, the majority in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that have been turned into temporary protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fight continues, the education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope that the school is open again soon, so that we can continue to learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
