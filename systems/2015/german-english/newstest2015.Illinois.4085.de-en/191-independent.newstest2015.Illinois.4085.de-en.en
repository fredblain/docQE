Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobsons hochgelobtem new novel about love and the letter ``J ''.
They zerflossen, one could best describe it, they are slowly on a box that you have in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he is too serious, exhausting, intense, aloof and perhaps kratzbürstig.
And then schüttelte him.
Kratzbürstig knew it.
He was stachelig, as in between.
The last victim of the sting was just starting the affair had been promising for a reduction of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and he might even have brought a degree of satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomon's was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and harsh as Port Reuben.
On 415.221, 190.908 81.011 you was the 60.139, 56.156, 35.363, Kevern on 15.390 for her aunt, has begun to south on 50.500 with an older monitoring on 174.903 and 221.352 the inherited the 74.140 with the relevant behalf, 111.217 24.323 Paradise Valley on a piece of land on 85.977 in a wet paradise 48.847, but on 207.958 valley).
For several years, no one lived in the house.
The pipes are taking in the bathrooms were still Nacktschnecken spiders, cannot, had left their mark on all windows and believed that they belong, and the garden was the as huge Kohlköpfe appeared überwachsen with weeds.
It was as the House from a children ’ s story, both alarming as attractive, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the list for the Man Booker Prize in 2014.
The Shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kevern had sat in the high grass on the broken deckchairs händchenhaltend with Ailinn and an unusually hot Frühlingsnachmittag. both had enjoyed the country with relaxing music and soothing news was self-sufficient, as the sight of its brown legs crossed it in an old song of a long forgotten black performer, listened to his father in the House in closed shutters, eingeklinkt like in the Dienstkonsole geistesabwesend.
Your feet are too great.
Due to their own aggressiveness songs of this kind were not played more on the console.
It is not prohibited banned - nothing was so right was not easy.
It was successfully obsolesziert, such as the word obsoleszieren.
The general taste, which managed the money never decrees and rules, and how the people in books the from-Tellerwäscher-to-millionaires-memoirs, Liebesromane Kochbücher and choose the music they so chose the Balladen.
In the euphoria of the day began Kevern big feet to an imaginary piano to play and in a gross-Komische Serenade Ailinns besingen.
Ailinn do not understand this.
This was a well-known song of Jazzpianisten called Fats Waller, 'he said it and automatically presented two fingers on his lips.
That his father had always done, in order to stop the letter J, before he came out of his mouth.
It was when he was still small started as a game between him and his father.
His father had played it with his own father, he says.
If you have a word with a J anfängst to put on your lips two fingers, it will cost you a penny.
It was not a very lustiges game at the time, and it was also not very fun.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz.
Ailinn had never heard what.
Jazz, even if it was not played directly.
This was no longer of improvisation.
It was only room for a single'if' in life.
The people wanted to start a verse where they end would be quite safe.
As well as the mind.
Its unpredictability, people nervous.
And Jazz was musical ausgedrückter intelligence.
When he was ten years old, was to have heard of Sammy Davis Junior without Kevern knew something about Jazz of the half-secret collection of old CDs of his father.
But at least that he had not Ailinn Fats Waller was black and white.
At their age, they probably could not remember a time, in the Popsänger were not black.
That was again no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society grateful the principle of Gruppenbegabung agreed - grateful, as the fate spared.
People with Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and body for entertainment and sports, so sang and ran them.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as by nature and were served with the task to ensure that no family remained without functioning telephone service.
What is left of the Polish community, did the drains; what was left of the Greeks, fact plate.
On 711.824, 126.041, those on 115.657 from 11.910 106.382, the Gulf States and 92.228 the Levant, their grandparents 20.191 71.777 on the country had not quickly rely on 572.797 than about what had happened, 518.151, 451.681, 56.161 if ES happen has happened - 362.409, 81.165 from fear, to be charged on 21.629 for Feuerschürens on 38.643, 45.414, 254.861 from fear, then that the flames eat on 34.084 next 49.706 as they were - 88.385, 62.585, had opened the 31.791, Labneh and Shisha-pipes-restaurants on 50.115, 23.763, remained in mind and have been on 65.170 30.717 51.243, with the lack of low.
Each according to his ability.
Because they had heard only ballads, it fell Ailinn difficult to understand how the offensive words, the Kevern's very front yard had ever could be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They are not really offensive," said Kevern.
Except perhaps for people whose feet are too big.
My father has never insult someone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him a false sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the soundproofing of huge cabbage leaves.
Ailinn still do not understand.
Why would your father should love something?
He wanted to say that it was a Jux, but hesitated to put two fingers to their lips again in their presence.
They already thought that he was a little strange.
``it appeared to him, ''he said.
She shook her head in disbelief and kept Keverns perspective.
There was nothing to see in the world, as her ungekämmtes pitch black hair.
There was nothing that otherwise he would want to see.
"If you say it," they mean no conviction.
But it never explains why you have me vorsingst.
They seemed to be honest.
My feet are too big?
He saw yet again.
Your feet do so directly.
Perhaps your ankle, a little bit...
And you say that you hates me because my ankle to fat?
You hate?
Of course I hate you.
This is only the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was still too early.
"Your thick ankles are precisely the reason why you find me gefällst," he tried it instead.
I am a bit perverse.
That sounded not right.
It was meant to be funny.
When he tried to be funny as his father did not reassuring Charm, because he needed to control the jokes inherent cruelty, he is often expressed in difficulties.
Perhaps his father wanted to be cruel.
Perhaps he wanted to be the, Kevern.
In spite of its kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomon's was red and arose from their deck chair, raised the console and buried the wine they had drunk.
Holunderblütenwein drunkenness, was no excuse for him.
In their excitement, they seemed to tremble, like palm fronds in the storm.
``your Dickkopf is precisely the reason why I took perverse to you myself, ''said they...
Except that I am not at all.
They did it, both because of the unnecessary Unfreundlichkeit his words, as well as the fear, in their eyes, as they showed him auflehnte.
They thought that he would beat them?
She had not told him of his life on the cold northern archipelago, where they grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially such as here.
The same huge and icy ocean broke up here and there on the shore.
On 265.142 509.686 on the same bewildered men, 219.699, 127.370 with 118.763, 37.738 still dickerer skin and 78.782, verdrießlicher on 67.131 after the 56.161, DEM what happened was 13.006 as it 57.759 their ancestors on 25.546 as 18.732, smugglers and wreckers on 67.601 was gone on 60.620 of pub on 30.661 to pub, 155.872 13.522 always willing to impose on the hand on 50.462 30.235 against a woman on 68.347, 58.840, 41.528 on I refused or verlachte.
Dickkopf?
It would have shown a big fist, if not farewells.
They only Knut Chen - Knut Chen was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the vacuous love ballads from the console - they only beat Knut Chen and then.
Keverns believe it was an unnecessary refinement that Knut Chen was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomon's gave him a sign to go through her body.
He arose from the deck chair as an old man.
They also felt bleiern, but the impact of his grief surprised them.
That was not the end of the world.
They knew very few.
They saw him as he removed himself - as he watched from a room on the top floor of their companion - a man, complained had provoked by something he himself.
Adam leaves the garden, they thought.
They felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against it.
A man turned on her, succumbed to his back, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why it was a sight that seemed to know them well, if they could not remember a single time, where they had seen something like this before the day before?
As it was alone to get back on their feet Ailinn Solomons.

But some properties are ineradicable.
The higher the tower, it seems, the less the passion he still inspires.
The population of cries sentimentaler berauscht Balladen, listening to stories about überwundene difficulties and claims to believe in the virtues of marriage and family life, but it is not only the former rudeness rural communities as well as our urban fabric in the hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and cowardly Streitsucht at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggeration," her mentor when he had read the entire report said.
I suggest that you read less Romane.
ESME Nussbaum by its head.
I must also ask: Are you an atheist?
I believe this must not say, 'I replied ESME Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Once stood ESME on their right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
A feminist?
Once silence.
``I ask not, ''said Luther Rabinowitz, finally, 'because I am against Atheismus, Lesbentum or feminism.
This is a vorurteilsfreier workplace.
We serve an unprejudiced society.
But certain types of hyper-sensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely unacceptable and commendable, occasionally can distort results, as you have presented to them.
They have obviously prejudices against the church, and these things that you describe as "disingenuous" and "raw" could be interpreted as well as an expression of strength and vitality of course by others.
If you happen to the herumreitet IS what happened when ES happened IS, as if it had happened yesterday, means to take its essential vitality to the country.
ESME Nussbaum looked around, while Rabinowitz said.
Behind his head repeated the advice of an LED lettering in Flamingo Rosa Ofnow gave the country in the last quarter-century or more.
Smile on their neighbours, you value your partner, you will hear ballads, please visit musicals, use your phone, you, you, you hear, you agree to excuse yourself.
Talk is better than silence gesungene word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I can absolutely understand what you want," ESME Nussbaum said in a quiet voice, as she was sure that her boss had spoken to an end, "and I say anything other than that we are still not healed as effectively as we fool ourselves.
My concern is that without notice of us, we may find, as we repeat the mistakes that led to disclose what will happen if IT IS done in the first place.
This time, but not the other, in which we miss our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formte in the hands of a pyramid.
To indicate a patience.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe the actions as a" mistake "that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They go too far, when you say that their ``rage ''and`` suspicions'' to ``other ''have been omitted.
It should be to remind anyone in your position, that the understanding of the past, such as the protection of the present, not by'us' and'other' are not necessary.
There was no ``and there was no'other'.
It was a time of disorder, which is what we know.
``From, if we are honest with ourselves, ''dared not part of society can claim to have acted well, ESME post.
I would accuse anybody.
Whether it was bad or good, what is done is done.
It was at that time.
There is nothing more to be said - because we are in agreement.
And assigned as it must be, if such a settlement would be appropriate and if there is a way to eradicate them, no fault must be repaid.
But what is the past, if we do not learn from it -
The past is designed to ensure that we forget it.
If I may say something -
Luther Rabinowitz, his pyramid coincide.
"I will remember her report," he said and dismissed them.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, it has been overtaken by a motorcyclist, who described as passers-by, was driven into a kind of "brutal rage" on the footpath.
Coincidences.
