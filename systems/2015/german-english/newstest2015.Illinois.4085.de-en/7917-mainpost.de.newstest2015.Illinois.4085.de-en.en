We have a huge strain on Rhöner luck my piece ``in our Rätselaufgabe the Sommerserie last Friday.
There are still a number of these giant trees in the county, the copy is the "Geißruheiche" above under white aroma.
A bumpy one walk leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It is a failure to Koppeln, Basaltsteinhaufen and Basaltsteinmeeren.
