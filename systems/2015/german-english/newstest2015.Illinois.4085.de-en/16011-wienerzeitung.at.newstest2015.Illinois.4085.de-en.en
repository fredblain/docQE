And he is brutally honest: From the Onanie as high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness.
Also, to demonstrate how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad areas are too abstract, but even more important concepts: Love, soul, ego, Being in Now, spirituality - all that he tried to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
