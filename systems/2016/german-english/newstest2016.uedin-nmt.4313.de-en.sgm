<seg id="2">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the meeting, however, it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that is being discussed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.</seg>
<seg id="6">Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction, accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.</seg>
<seg id="7">Through the deal brokered by Obama over Iran's nuclear program, the relationship between the two has deteriorated further.</seg>

<seg id="1">In an emergency call, Professor admits to having his girlfriend shot</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly scratchy voice of police that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," which was in the letter, according to the authorities, and he was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10: 18 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when police raided him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said they were freaking out on his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some incumbents to problematic behavior.</seg>
<seg id="16">One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds, saying that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not give him a guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing from campus, police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car still ran in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was the women's swarm at the time.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate from a marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein house, bordering on a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said the dog was OK.</seg>
<seg id="39">Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer vintage market three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together the one or another Gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a Barker and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time, after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonicaspiel finished in front of a sparse crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">There were no signs that anything was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were on cleaning up and joking at each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, directed the first semester training program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight commemoration.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the memorial station, while the University-schor "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We're trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call Prentiss was called his wife, but there was no indication that the two were ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll results showing that Donald Trump is serious.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others dismissed him as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down, it (still) didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double-digit lead, and some are starting to get serious about what it means for the odds of the Real Estate's nomination.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow to topple him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumps's approval ratings have turned around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth-University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And those numbers keep in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP-voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, would be the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans don't see Trumps temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and abusive statements, 52 percent of the Republican-leaning Irish voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same figure applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively execute his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If they set up their erudition, Republican voters hold Trump for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 say that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change since the time when four out of 10 at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP-voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still, it is apparent that a variety of GOP-led voters see Trumps's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost anyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trumps' leadership, while anti-gun support is difficile to more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina's 13 points, ahead of Marco Rubio's 14 points, before Walker scored 15 points, before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have their voices fixed.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">Forty-six percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trumps is strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapist" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was pivotal in public discourse to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump's crucial Hispanic-Americans will be kept away by the Republican Party and will damage the reorient efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it, too.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration over the government clings to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, meanwhile, around half the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they'd rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they're also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa-Republians are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish angry."</seg>

<seg id="2">Two-time goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.</seg>
<seg id="3">A lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.</seg>
<seg id="4">A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Idol have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witchbowl of Piraeus.</seg>
<seg id="6">The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kickoff in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers's double-pack (52nd/90+ 2) and Idol hits (89th) earned by 3: 0 (0: 0).</seg>
<seg id="7">The twelfth star success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.</seg>
<seg id="8">At his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller received friendly support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a shot of the world champion as a flanker.</seg>
<seg id="9">"We're not going to underestimate them," Baylor captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich held word.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed a focused and dedicated idea without shining.</seg>
<seg id="11">Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.</seg>
<seg id="12">In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) also stumbled here.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.</seg>
<seg id="14">They went boldly, but they were often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.</seg>
<seg id="15">The attacks have been launched too often by game shift on left-hander Douglas Costa, who has rarely come through against former Zealand's Omar Elabdellaoui.</seg>
<seg id="16">Müller had been more lucky from the right when his flanker slipped out of the right half-field in the left upper gate.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2: 0.</seg>
<seg id="18">The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.</seg>
<seg id="19">First, as Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland's headball from the line (26th).</seg>
<seg id="20">Then by direct delivery, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knee pared (35).</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bayern moved to their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle sticks.</seg>
<seg id="22">On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, though, was leaving.</seg>
<seg id="23">So, for example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte (56th).</seg>
<seg id="24">Before Neuer, Guardiola was allowed to defend a four-seater with David Alaba at the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mario Idol, after muscular problems back in the caddie, first sat outside.</seg>
<seg id="26">The World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training session, said athletic director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different from this is already malignant."</seg>
<seg id="27">Even at the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski (59th).</seg>
<seg id="28">Idols arrived late for Arturo Vidal (7-6) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter, Müller added one more.</seg>
<seg id="29">Before the game, it was in the stadium to tie.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a smaller group of partially married Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and walked out with batters against the Munich supporters.</seg>
<seg id="31">At least one Bayern-Fan was transported out of the stadium.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth</seg>
<seg id="2">Those who smoke will harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good news: In the case of abandonment, the risk falls quickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is based on the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="6">Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, hitting the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.</seg>
<seg id="9">For these periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, emphasize the authors.</seg>
<seg id="10">So the link between smoking and tooth decay is due to more frequent gum infections in smokers.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.</seg>
<seg id="12">People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, it could take more than ten years to put the risk back to the level of non-smokers, explained Erdutor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.</seg>
<seg id="14">People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing told DIfE: "Smoking is shortening the lifetime."</seg>
<seg id="15">Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health to the high age.</seg>
<seg id="16">In Germany, over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Commission proposes in row over TTIP new court</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more traditional in the way it works.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to establish a system that citizens trust," the EU commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, said in the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede is proposing to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">TTIP aims to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically stipulate that the EU Member States and the United States will jointly choose independent judges for a new Investment Court.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are to be made to equal parts from the EU, the United States and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the first time, there is also a second instance.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow it to appeal against verdicts.</seg>
<seg id="12">Until now, the procedural parties agreed with each other on referees, an appeal against their sentences did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the debate over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and fairness.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court, according to its own data.</seg>
<seg id="15">There, for example, there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU Member States.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) demanded by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbiters are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, over which companies claim compensation at the expense of taxpayers, erode national laws or impose a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first statements, anti-TTIP organisations, such as Campact, described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="19">It has been criticised, in particular, that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).</seg>
<seg id="20">The German Business Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission takes account of key points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel, has drawn up with other EU trade ministers in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitration is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European business association, BusinessEurope, warned against restricting the economy's actions by too many new rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be put at a disadvantage, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed, it remained unclear on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">Negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The issue of investor protection, however, has not been discussed with the US.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally, a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This date is considered to be no longer tenable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Delicate folk from Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).</seg>
<seg id="3">Next to him stands a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with fillip.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens talk.</seg>
<seg id="5">He tells of different places he keeps recording on the map, what his minutest and tender arranged songs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where they were born and how it looks there, in his homeland.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since then, Stevens has turned out to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the 2003 and 3rd album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State," he cleverly composed songs that blend harmoniously with the American folk of the late sixties, but always be able to drift into the great opulence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There's the rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a twisted series: Each of the 50 US states should be bested in succession.</seg>
<seg id="10">As early as 2004 and in Rheinnear, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive expectations.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result, Stevens is stepping down here.</seg>
<seg id="12">Live is enough for him to play guitar and banjo.</seg>
<seg id="13">A year later, the musician living in New-York is returning to the series.</seg>
<seg id="14">With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Present You To: Come on Feel The Oregoise") appears a nationwide celebrated masterpiece in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">Brimming with ideas and stylistic finesse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The album is rising into the American Billboard charts and is missing in no annual list of the influential music media.</seg>
<seg id="17">After exceedingly productive experiments, Stevens then served on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic computations.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sixth proper studio album is still widely orchestrated, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall.</seg>
<seg id="19">As long as the smaller clubs have moved away, the stage shows here will be the colourful spectacle of neon-foreheads and large fluorescent Bühnendeko.</seg>
<seg id="20">Today, Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-man band.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the dark Hamburg More!</seg>
<seg id="22">He mainly presents the "Carrie & Lowell," which has been available since March.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although there are now nearly 2,000 guests stranded in their chairs, the far more mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without giving a word to the audience, the group is playing excellent musicians through the widely enriched album.</seg>
<seg id="25">From the audience, one hears: The talk is "opulent" and you can throw the "record straight away."</seg>
<seg id="26">First of all, Stevens abdicated modestly, playing acoustically few older songs, and eventually reverted to the applause.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's Question Time</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to make his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time and to equip himself with David Cameron for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">MR Corbyn will stand up to put the first of its six straight questions shortly after noon, with his performance from the media likely and the Labour MP from close to scrutiny.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns's leadership, since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Torah MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "been in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air raid around England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnout programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyns's comments on the position on the European Union and the limit on profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory-leader in the last decade over the dispatch-box in parliament.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from doing both "batting" and the striker with opposition, and has instead moved on to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Business Secretary, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "fake theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling by a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="3">Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.9% over the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="4">This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and made assessments on the timing of an interest rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pound rose by more than 1 per cent against the dollar to $1,5505 and was up 0.84 per cent against the euro to €1.3730.</seg>
<seg id="6">The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.</seg>
<seg id="7">SABMiller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20% after takeover offer from rival AB InBev.</seg>
<seg id="8">A transaction would combine the world's two largest breweries and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.</seg>

<seg id="12">Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.</seg>

<seg id="2">Potatoes or döner?</seg>
<seg id="3">It goes both - in the potato döner, developed by the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inspired by the phrase "potato rather than döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat put together on a stick.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the idea, he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of döner," which he had accidentally seen on television.</seg>

<seg id="7">"This is Multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea has now been written by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="9">It has recently been protected as a utility model, according to the authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">So, how much meat and how much potatoes the cronies contain, Alhay does not want to betray them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash launches ground level campaign to fight Ald. incursion</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches ahead of an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">During Aldi's opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media, as well as events such as Adelaideshow.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishmaker Simmo from Dunsborough, distributed in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA-Lade stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snap out around five per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first markets, and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, and will achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley is assuming that Metcash's sales in the food and food business are down 3.8 per cent in 2016, down 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler wrestles and invests more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private-Label food.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shoplifting programs will go to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came under the spotlight by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterward, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison called out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the kid."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis bat after a cramp failed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth to take second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing about which I'm quite concerned about it is the fact that after I think Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has broken a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's been treated a little too strictly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room, he's trained hard, he's good in form, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he secures the man from Canberra as a long-term fixture to return to the team."</seg>
<seg id="14">"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies surrounding [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that, in the eyes of the people like Federer and Murray, he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back</seg>
<seg id="2">Hungary declared the state of emergency and ripped off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding all the firm trying to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people who fled violence were stranded for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "opened the border!" and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some pointed out food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution rather than collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil on the ungarish-Serb border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the overridden Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, next month or until the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include an additional 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="15">Tuesday's emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and has become the gateway to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4-metre (13 foot) high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament must still agree to the military's use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters told Associated Press on the border there were heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already seen for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, land security adviser for Orban, said that authorities told 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already invaded the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train truck collided with barbed wire to close the borders.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to get there.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved</seg>
<seg id="2">Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (rising by 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders posted some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is back here only with 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their leading candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time that a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Clinton's supporters, her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Consent to deal with the problems and electability are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president casts a potential for president in the wake, 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.</seg>
<seg id="23">If Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats' nomination, Hillary Clinton's edge ahead of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selective" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, on the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate, or potential candidate, stands out as unacceptable for these voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important traits among voters of their party's primaries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden cuts best among the three candidates in terms of honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters of the primaries generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">For all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Given questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during tenure as secretary of state, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion of her was still deteriorating.</seg>
<seg id="41">It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have gotten worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters: Only 32 per cent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">Sixty-two percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks on leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut best in honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ben Carson is in the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump</seg>
<seg id="3">The two candidates now account for half of the support of voters in the new poll, and others lose dramatically to stop</seg>
<seg id="4">Republican voters continue to support Trump in large numbers nationwide, with support growing from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before Fox News debate last month, up 27% in Tuesday's poll.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Carson shot up from 6% to 23% in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="6">The survey also found that Carson does well at demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and compatriot Governor John Kasich, is cut off with Wis. Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen to the deepest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.</seg>
<seg id="8">Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida-Senator Marco Rubio are up with 6% in third place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The error margin at the sample of 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is Plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he lands at 19% support among Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brulik attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction session in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was charged with linked eyes with a 30-pound replica of sand filled with sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, then fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">Members of the Pi-DeltaPsi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to police.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they had the time to switch Dengs's clothing, his symptoms to goose and Andy Meng to contact the Brotherhood's national president to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide Utensilien and put the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to head, hull and thigh.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood... at least one student has been dying of harassment since 1970 every year," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bruising and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder third-graders for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of bullying and forming a criminal association.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that - officially or inofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">An interest rate rise is coming, and the domestic bill will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants might find that all the fuss about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money,"" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, that does not mean there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy might react:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest-rate hikes can make things more volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There appears to be a tendency for asset sales to abate 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More accurately, the market in the past 35 years has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return will begin to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest-rate hikes often encourage them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank, at the rate of 118 interest rates since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5%.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest-rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have been caught on an interest-rate hike by the Fed all year, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading gives only a 25 percent probability.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all increase in the rate of growth from 1950 to present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and pre-receptacles very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report concluded.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months so far.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equities if they change their strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">On bonds, the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to be closer together and lead to a draining of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about expecting higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is interesting, according to Jones, that markets have already adjusted to Fed-strategy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the earning curve is flat, credit ratings have expanded and volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">At large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, averaging 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital yields as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is going to be a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">The Conservative member of Parliament criticised the station for its "dumbing"</seg>
<seg id="3">He argues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="4">He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said she only imitated The Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked the broadcast The Voice and said that this was not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "is transforming" to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of parliament and raising new pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something the private broadcaster does not do.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Conservative MP, Andrew Bingham, also told BBC bosses that the public broadcaster was "stupid" and increasingly no longer different from its commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "stupid" - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The Brits just under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you're trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market," said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC director-general dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public awareness.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, I won't learn about classical music anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works, I also really think it's important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it needed to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because Britons are less informed about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sport to replace commercial rivals on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Tory-MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you see why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC way."</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he wants the company to "find a hit out of our in-house stall" when it launches an entertainment series next time.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money of the fee payers for other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales rose at the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for that</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven per cent increase in online sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month was the lowest result since records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe the Black Friday in November has slowed spending</seg>
<seg id="6">For over a decade, virtual shopping has drilled, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">Total spending for August represented the lowest rise in growth since records began in 2000, with only five per cent increase over the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent growth in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now this is shifting, and we may see that growth is diminishing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The black-friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, five times the average number of buyers scrambled around their computers to make their bargains, and some vendor websites crashed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Muslims buried in Mecca at crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned</seg>
<seg id="2">The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca through the streets</seg>
<seg id="3">Saudi Arabia settles the collapse in part of the giant Saudic Bin-Ladel group</seg>
<seg id="4">The Department of Health said that, in addition, a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed</seg>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mekka's big moshee.</seg>
<seg id="6">Mourners filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="7">The funeral procession moved past the Holy See, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the bedside.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.</seg>
<seg id="9">The bodies of 29 mourners who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mozhee Mekkas were carried through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was assisted.</seg>
<seg id="11">MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsh in the Great Mosque.</seg>
<seg id="12">Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.</seg>
<seg id="13">Today, King Salman said the Bin-Ladel group should not have stood the arm of the crane when it was not used.</seg>
<seg id="14">An Arab version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Ladel Group was partly responsible for the collapse.</seg>
<seg id="15">The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was banned from traveling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the big mozhee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsh, which takes place later this month.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Bin-Ladel Group did not issue statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Royal Decree also tamed the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dozens of crows surrounded Mekka's big moshee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin-Ladel Group.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Bin Laden family has been affiliated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on larger construction projects.</seg>
<seg id="21">The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="22">The crane's crash came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="23">Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="24">Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (£174,000) to be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount of permanent casualties.</seg>
<seg id="25">Other injuries get half that amount.</seg>

<seg id="1">B & Q Boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind</seg>
<seg id="4">As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at artisans, will open</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent of the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">It is claimed that Britons are laying down their hammers and brush in favor of using qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes</seg>
<seg id="8">If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be in a minority today.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out pet jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Véronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the tree-lined chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, which offers services to low prices, is now outdated.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores that cater to tradesmen and close 60 outlets of B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Qshops, because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are taken by women.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the moment, the employees outweigh the men.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "It still works by a majority of men in our branches.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to shift this closer to a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Basically, half of our customers from women are 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a major role in the decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FTSE100 index, has also surrounded her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and moves after the group owed the cost of closing the stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.</seg>

<seg id="1">Officials from Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court</seg>
<seg id="2">On Wednesday, two officials from the Austrian volleyball vice-chancellor, Aich/Dob, were to be held responsible for infidelity and dismissal.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defendants pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them had also been charged with abuse of power.</seg>
<seg id="5">He has been formally acquitted of this allegation in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current trial was adjourned.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to District Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it emerged that, in 2006 to 2011, the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes.</seg>
<seg id="8">The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.</seg>
<seg id="10">This fact left the head of the Council of Scots, Judge Michaela Sanin.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is to be negotiated at a later date.</seg>
<seg id="12">To dismiss the infidelity, the defense set out that the club had not created an asset afterward at any time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sports officials had only billed expenses and sued the sports club, for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="14">"At that time, we stood in front of the situation: Do we continue or block the club?" he told one of the defendants, in the bread profession of the Financial Office.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on that task.</seg>
<seg id="16">With all the risks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have put forward money, our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at concussion.</seg>
<seg id="18">The association has been agreed: You can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.</seg>
<seg id="19">Furthermore, in the event of a corresponding financial success, the payment of expenses retroactive to 1991 has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="20">As a result, some of the expenses were paid only years later, as from 2003, when a plus was on the account.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore, flat and non-detailed bookings seemed to be the case, the former Obman explained the events.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why the payouts had not been fully disclosed to the club, the judge asked.</seg>
<seg id="24">The association was not interested in the detail of financial management, important only was debt freedom, according to the response.</seg>
<seg id="25">When, in 2011, against an official investigation into abuse of office, an amount of €120,000 was transferred to the association's account.</seg>
<seg id="26">These were resignations, the defendants said.</seg>
<seg id="27">This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club, according to its statement.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Why?" the judge wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="29">The respondents did not know the answer for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="30">He eventually said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.</seg>
<seg id="31">If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.</seg>
<seg id="32">The co-accused had been informed, justified by the official.</seg>
<seg id="33">This bank transfer has been formulated as a "damage recovery."</seg>
<seg id="34">Why claim damages?, wanted Judge and prosecutor to know.</seg>
<seg id="35">On that, the first defendant declared that he did not agree with that wording because the association had never been harmed.</seg>
<seg id="36">But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the tailor."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the official said he never paid a cent salary, he only billed mileage fees and diets.</seg>
<seg id="39">On diets, he billed the club £1,000 a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.</seg>
<seg id="40">Exact documents for the early years could not show the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="41">These were no longer preserved after an operating audit, in which everything had been judged correctly, they said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mileage allowance had also been referred to the second defendant.</seg>
<seg id="43">All sticking points were made in cash, to which he would have to move from his hometown of international market to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="44">The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week of the view that the Fed will do so, now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>

<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shouted and killed his colleague later in the day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" in the first murder and wanted "he could make it undone," authorities announced on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the helpline at 10: 00 on Monday morning</seg>
<seg id="4">And said he fired on someone and someone killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb told the staff of the emergency room that police had to send police to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" was in the house but that "no one will disturb" but is likely to be excited.</seg>
<seg id="7">Police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.</seg>
<seg id="9">As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, who said: "I am so sorry, I wanted, I could undo it.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before eventually taking his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangular relationship."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who testified that they were married about seven years, as a "good man."</seg>
<seg id="15">The two were divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O'Steen said he and Prentiss would have a daughter, who is 19, and she was "destroyed on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that Prentiss were her daughter "absolutely best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked online from home, according to testimony from Linsday Knowles, identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had met with Lamb for about three years.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said</seg>
<seg id="21">Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When police arrested him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb received a doctorate in the spring of 2015 from Delta State University, as his life portrait indicates on the university's website.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="3">Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.</seg>
<seg id="4">150 of the world's roughly 1,000 executives will cost the group restructuring the job.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.</seg>
<seg id="6">Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost carriers of Eurowings.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of about €500 million a year from cost and proceeds syncing, the airline said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Among other things, Lufthansa does not have a board in the future for the passenger business.</seg>
<seg id="9">The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.</seg>
<seg id="11">With the new position, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex.</seg>
<seg id="13">The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the company's annual sales of 30 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="14">New negotiations with the pilots</seg>
<seg id="15">In the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are expected to resume after the court's legal strike on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="16">That told the union.</seg>
<seg id="17">The subject of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.</seg>
<seg id="18">"In a year with a projected record result," the cockpit aims to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="19">The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the "Wings" savings concept.</seg>
<seg id="21">It provides that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, places routes to the Group's own low-cost line Eurowings.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right ball in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this has brought the left field defender to wine and will rule him out for at least six months from playing, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was crying.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that takes six months and he won't play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope he can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="14">Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexicans.</seg>
<seg id="15">Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="16">You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a very serious attack with both legs.</seg>
<seg id="18">A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news, words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger again."</seg>
<seg id="19">Related: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV</seg>
<seg id="20">The England defender, with the European Championship in France, has an additional incentive to recover by next June.</seg>
<seg id="21">Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."</seg>
<seg id="22">When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland-team at the 2014 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="25">"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very serious injury, that's not good," Cocu said.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me, it was not possible to see the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.</seg>
<seg id="28">Talking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.</seg>
<seg id="29">I feel very bad, and I am so sorry.</seg>
<seg id="30">The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.</seg>

<seg id="2">It's one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won't last long before you know it almost out of touch.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless, of course, you may be David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, which was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company's super camps, and continues: "fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I am happy to read out to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we've missed so far."</seg>
<seg id="6">All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's plot, instead reflects a summary of the film version of 2012, adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy called Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads: A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but was completely unaware of that in 1991.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that was not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, is hoping to win the girl of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the action of the book, listening to an unnamed boy, such as the local environment, by the money hawkish, trees fake, Thneed knitting onlookers despite the protests of the namesake Lorax, a hooky, cordoned-off creature, "which speaks in the name of the trees," to be devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team, but it's still hard</seg>
<seg id="2">Hitting on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the cadres that England have chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat is not on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">I wouldn't rule out an upside.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cooks's side may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin-players in the battle line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youthful positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball developing Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at Test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related news: Adam Lyth drops out of the England Test cadres and is replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, hard to analyse.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I've said this before - players are their own best selections.</seg>
<seg id="10">A long time ago, it would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he hopes to make further runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform such good performances, and that doesn't surprise me; he's mainly a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set up his sign is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to go home and out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batting man, whom I value highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's an X Factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spin-off bowler and received four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a batter can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricketer players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop, before appearing as an opener in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="24">He managed three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up-spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his stats - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there's not a large number of backup spiders who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Aside from the team, England have made a couple of smart additions to the coach.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master ercoup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nettest guys of the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammates at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some won't agree, but Coaches and team members don't determine the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit-Lager (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could win on allowance if the economy gets into a slump by 2017</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's ill-fated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the Tuc, who are fiercely divided because of Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always of their own fault, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they mostly do not want, are fed up.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they were at risk of social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, who wants a Britain that is outside the EU in the interior of the EU tent - "not alone with France," says Berlin - and suggests that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's cautiously bespectacled Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long audition like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a fading force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie-British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from being out of the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks, entirely in the SNP-style, during Britain's referential campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexite process, my friend is suspected.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a default" and "Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on its cost, and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as they did during Tony Benn's inspired referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can look weak on Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who has made himself a name as a "EU Gerade Banks" Brussels-based correspondent in the early 90-years.</seg>
<seg id="19">With all his reticence, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included the Medley of tax-raising villains, phone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-Instates that own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's refereeing dumbbells, because Blair had put the principle on the EU's unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never told him to do so.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn't need to waste any time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80-year-old, a mistake then and today.</seg>
<seg id="25">It can last, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyns's official position on Europe is - I call it a friendly - in development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, most of the people outside Ukip's traditional blistering bulletins and the wildest jails of Tory's petty Englishism can probably say yes to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week said when the Scouts struggled in him, not to admit that Corbyns's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70-years when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's fight was even more appealing.</seg>
<seg id="32">But struggling to stay "under any circumstances" - Benny's expression - was not what McDonnell said was still what JC told his comrades and deputies after all the reports at their Clues' meeting on Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the stemmed Bottom-Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyns's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is felony confident that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria, even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power, where I was reminded of something at the start on Monday, which was called the British Influence Security Forum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise report from Public Health England over e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegations by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE released the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE reasoned its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims were "based on stone or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for multiple causal decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage from different nicotine containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was previously told of British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also underwrote BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was expected to receive after reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, added it.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not delivered, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting, PHE's tobacco management also attended.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group's research "admits tellingly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there has so far been no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health care system £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By clarifying current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should abandon Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK-Sones.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for making public programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-pressed time windows against the most popular shows by their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC director-general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 without success trying to come into contact with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee in his inquiry on the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least be based on programmes that others do not make or mandate.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be funded without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am trying to see how this should be public-law television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who chaired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for valuations "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give this back to what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as Eastenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public-service niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they are fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue that if they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a window of opportunity in which no one ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the radio charge, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think you get a big value for £150 a year here, but for people who are for the £150m a lot of money, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and it should set an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in "inform, enlighten and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful are shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impulses work by switching Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">More on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Fade worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the seasoning cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">If he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they turn the modified Motoneurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light, which must be sent down to an optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue freely and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="21">VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that reigned around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a vacancy of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertisement, but "through the concussion with bright colors and animation, it stays stronger."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal resale devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not acting illegally on our doorstep.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for life in student homes</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year-old to a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I was annoyed - and to the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It's tempting to smile: People tell you where you come from, whether and where you've taken Sabbath year, where you are in reference to Corbyn and why you "honestly have Marmite neither love nor hate, because in earnest, guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Breathe through.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It distracts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Leave people.</seg>
<seg id="10">People's rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes, film night venues and municipal hits, but they are also the places where people put themselves in and turn their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related: Don't think about starting at university with a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts received rough treatment at the university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space shuttle culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when a commitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking to knock on: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">One guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Friendship close by baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you start the university at the peak of the Back-mania, the Klopfen is on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies, less strange than greeting the 1950-year-old "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something to you, so, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and, in the end, perhaps associate your face with a tasty surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Badly missing clumps of flour, sugar and fat mean that people are sleeping when you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check that with the milk owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">The odds are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my co-workers, who added their milk a sink to punish thieves.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">They should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors whether it made them feel a little quieter, drum & bass, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded with even more tepid music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before crashing their own music, closed their door and went to their three-hour test.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, wouldn't it be abysmal embarrassing if you keep a co-worker for your future spouse, ranting at her, rebounding herself and then seeing her every day and perhaps witnessing how she wanders all common friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co-worker definitely isn't your future spouse, try at least to give your underbelly a little sanity.</seg>
<seg id="40">At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good stint is funny, but it only takes moments before he becomes a boomerang.</seg>
<seg id="42">Teach by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but don't look at someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Shut her door, and put her keys in a glass of water, which then put you in the freezer - but punches her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who do not have much money.</seg>
<seg id="3">For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living room, but also the mother and the low paid."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I show how you can still build good and well today," the 44-year-old says in interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur, Markus Gildner, is believed to know how quickly living space can be created: He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people stay to a large part here.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given the flow of refugees, we also need enough housing in the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs the least place.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">That's different when you're letting people down in residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses currently built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What is the cost?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square feet of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction lasted six months.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have the building regulations complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: I have mastered my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is particularly difficult to find the threat of Damoklessch special construction and the location regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Grinning.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still subject to who in a terraced house creates three flats, needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities there is no room for this.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents react to their terraced home project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">Which is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: True, we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low paid.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how to build cheap and well today.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what it is all about.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app, typing on "General" and then selecting "Software Update."</seg>
<seg id="3">If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the "software update failed."</seg>
<seg id="5">To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to decline or try to update via iTunes.</seg>
<seg id="6">The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely to do so by streamlining the update, and it will be easier to do that if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charging device, so the battery is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.</seg>

<seg id="2">Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.</seg>
<seg id="3">In addition to consultation, you can also participate in courses.</seg>
<seg id="4">The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="5">To be more precise, at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.</seg>
<seg id="6">A new district office has recently been opened.</seg>
<seg id="7">Here, right next to the purchasing market, from now on, seniors and council members receive information on issues such as care insurance or services of sick and nursing homes.</seg>
<seg id="8">For years we have been using our outpatient care service to ensure that carers are left alone.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are an infinite number of questions.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Also, not often many benefits of the coffers are not used, because the complexity of the insurance industry is barely understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who as a business division manager for AltenAid is also responsible for the Antonista and Citizens Hospital, as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus."</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.</seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, the Saludis was taken to the boat.</seg>
<seg id="13">Therefore, you can use additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.</seg>
<seg id="15">Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The senior center for care and care," explained Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.</seg>
<seg id="17">The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change.</seg>
<seg id="18">This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future indispensable.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underscored the opening ceremonies, dedicating the district attorney's office to the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular sociable get-together."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment.</seg>
<seg id="21">The district attorney's office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="2">Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felenstausen.</seg>
<seg id="3">We are also pleased to welcome Sammy's Mayor Bernd Bormann, Business Development in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.</seg>
<seg id="4">In many places in the country, doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, are lucky: On 1 October, Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fellowship.</seg>
<seg id="5">While Ursel Felenstausen is retiring, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, will face his successor in the next few months with half a point.</seg>
<seg id="6">After a remodeling period, Müller opens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros into the premises at St Marcellus Road 6.</seg>
<seg id="7">There was a great deal of sympathy at first sight, when, before years Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who, for the time being, complete their medical education at the Hospital in Vermont and will also be able to enter into practice at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felenstausen and laughs.</seg>
<seg id="9">"When it was up, I just called them."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mrs Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.</seg>
<seg id="12">"We would like to meet and accompany the families over the years."</seg>
<seg id="13">As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.</seg>
<seg id="14">And so it was agreed, the dumpers bought the house with the practice.</seg>
<seg id="15">However, they will continue to live in fracture Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="16">There, the two-time family friend, Frank Müller, also grew up, his medical school in Hanover, followed by stations in several doctors' practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, he works as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was ordered to become a chief medical doctor in Diepholz County, and is a volunteer in the DRK-readiness fault house Vilsen.</seg>
<seg id="18">As of September 19, the practice is being prepared for the new boss.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felenstausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Müllers, both internists, want to settle as family doctors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Endoscopy is coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.</seg>
<seg id="22">After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.</seg>
<seg id="23">We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress EKGs and need a talk room more.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, the IT system is completely renewed.</seg>
<seg id="25">A grant of a total of EUR 50000 will receive the Müllers within the framework of a grant program from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtcommunity (12500 euros) and the community ($12500).</seg>
<seg id="26">"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues," notes Samtpublic's chief executive Bernd Bormann.</seg>
<seg id="27">According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the practice field for every quarter, in the North German average practice, it is about 500.</seg>
<seg id="28">There is another doctor's practice in Asendorf.</seg>
<seg id="29">A positive side effect of the practical assumption by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felenstausen.</seg>
<seg id="30">If no successor had been found, she would have gone, too.</seg>
<seg id="31">Anyone who visits Müller's speaking time will continue to look, in particular, in familiar faces: Take over the seven medical workers and the cleaners from the field.</seg>
<seg id="32">With their departure in Asendorf, an era, after all, doctors practiced there for 30 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felenstausen shouted.</seg>
<seg id="34">A little grumpy, after a long period of time, they have fallen.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often," the internist says.</seg>
<seg id="36">Her husband added laughing: "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."</seg>
<seg id="37">"So far, I've always pushed myself in front of gardening, now that could be different."</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the couple have two grandchildren and are happy to travel.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Well, border controls are also ramping up on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikltiktner.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum could also make it "self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="5">People's supply and security are paramount.</seg>
<seg id="6">But it is also clear that it needs clear signals," the minister said.</seg>
<seg id="7">People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migratory flows, even over the Austrian-Slovenian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">It takes a controlled approach.</seg>
<seg id="9">Croatia considering 'corridor' - Slovenia denied</seg>
<seg id="10">The Croatian Government had previously said that Slovenia, too, wanted to allow incoming refugees to travel to Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also set up corridors for the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, the interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see it.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will rather intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia does not want to impose its limits on refugees.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Every EU member has to fill out his obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," Györkös Znidar pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Croatian Government pointed out, the first refugees would have tried to arrive at the Tovarnik/sid border crossing in eastern Croatia at the time of the night, in order to escape the registration.</seg>
<seg id="17">Croatian police were able to pick them up in nearby corn fields.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to local media, there have been regular police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian Tovarnik.</seg>
<seg id="19">These are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Emergency services and the Red Cross are also already deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the coming days, his country will have about 4000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian border, which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border, were diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade, however, is saying that it is up to the people to adopt certain routes: "neither can we, nor do we want to do this," it said.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the media reports, in the morning, a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, more buses would be expected.</seg>
<seg id="25">About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The inmates were travelling all night from the roughly 500-kilometer Macedonian border through Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We heard that Hungary had made up, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.</seg>
<seg id="29">This could, in fact, lead to a slightly further west end of the previous wave of observers already predicted by observers of the previous Balkan route to Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: 'comprehensive opportunities for border control'</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's interior minister, Ostojic, had previously stressed that his country was preparing for the case of a strong influx of refugees with appropriate plans for possible emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">He did not mention details, but he pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, had "comprehensive opportunities for border control."</seg>
<seg id="33">Use strict controls to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have been a good witness to the country since then, as far as the standard of border controls is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees remain trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the previous night at the Horgos crossing, which leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local witness in Horgos: He considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, for premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">There would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="41">One could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Aid workers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not dangerous: In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war still not cleared mine fields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine cleaners was sent in the border region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ecumenical Hospice Relief Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="2">There is non-stop operation around the Mannheimer Exhibition Centre.</seg>
<seg id="3">People do their concerns, sometimes fast paces, partially cozy bumbling.</seg>
<seg id="4">They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons at the venue.</seg>
<seg id="5">Keep city streets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Pulsating, prall life at wonderful autumn solstice and mittens four large plates each with the headline "Bevor I die I want to be."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ecumenical hospitalization, with this action, drew attention to its 20-year existence and is certainly facing mixed reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It's about life, so we've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief is available to the passers-by as well as to questions and talks, such as the volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">While some prefer a passer-by spontaneously to chalk up, "read the phrase "my life," "with the camper going through the United States," "to stop the war" or "not suffer for a long time," others remain short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Time and again, on the sidelines, there are small discussions about the action itself, about life, how to deal with the dying.</seg>
<seg id="12">Even Peter Hübinger is just on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Just when I make it clear that for me to end up coming to the end of this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic Works of Mannheim, which is jointly with the Caritas-based Association of Ecumenical Hospital Assistance.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, this high-profile action on 20-year-olds is good.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The subject of death and dying is still littered with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up.</seg>
<seg id="17">An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.</seg>
<seg id="18">The death and funeral companion is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">Confronted by personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the Ecumenical hospitalization was sought by calling volunteers, they immediately reported and had been involved in the creation in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="21">Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and loved ones in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of St Vincent.</seg>
<seg id="22">All of them are carefully trained.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and his experiences and experiences.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I see the life of another warty, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The offer of the outpatient Öcumenian hospice service is free of charge and confessional.</seg>
<seg id="26">The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from families and associations enables the training as well as training and supervisions of the dying and funeral attendants.</seg>
<seg id="27">Every two years we offer training for new employees.</seg>
<seg id="28">The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, financial prospects cut for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reports disappointing results for the latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would want to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the earlier forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that will be charged from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it nevertheless expects earnings to rise above the previous year due to cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of growth in online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."</seg>
<seg id="11">Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to the stash.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales at ground sports rose 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in the years, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it's time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming over them at one end of the decorated, two-story session is a wall image of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation's economic interests ahead of all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a two-run order from Congress: Maximizing U.S. employment and prices here stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unscripted third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And that third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict, and it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is startlingly ready to disengage from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the economy's data show that it is growing solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious FedEx officials fearful of increasing this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and it is only a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the job market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which is uncertain of the financial market itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets, however, expect a Fed wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30 per cent chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate unless strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that Fed policy maintained the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed were to raise rates at this time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Just a month ago, the Fed seemed on a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said in spring and early summer that this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, an increase in the rate would be expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the job market this year was solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the Fed sees as full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation was consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, FedEx officials said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But financial markets around the world rallied late last month after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would cut global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now up nearly 10% below May's high.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the FedEx officials, the market turmoil affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last couple of weeks, they would put the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's main concerns, so it should not be included in its decision-making process.</seg>
<seg id="34">But, at the end of the day, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, FedEx officials can expect that they will not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for asset management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market movements that with apparently not linked to economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, advocating an increase in interest rates, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, FedEx officials reversed those cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market collapse in 2008, said Adam S. Poznan, former member of the Committee on Retirement of the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil does not come near that level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She certainly doesn't want to get into the situation where she's afraid of a rate hike because the markets are getting up," said Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think it should be ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="3">Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumors.</seg>

<seg id="2">The local councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="3">And he made an exception.</seg>
<seg id="4">The roof may be flat for solar panels.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plans for the long-awaited turnaround construction at the Bernrieder Sports Area are moving forward step by step: In the recent local council meeting, the prepared construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a construction legal "exemption" from the current development plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the case of the "exception," permission was granted for a special form in relation to roof construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus, a "saddle-roof with non-common first and roof stand" is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels: "By doing this we get a wonderfully large southern roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">For the sake of "liberation," it was supposed to be among ten degrees, for energetic reasons, other than in the development plan.</seg>
<seg id="11">The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced.</seg>
<seg id="12">A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan for the roof of the roof does not allow for "exceptions" - with the Bernrieder council usually more restrictive in the case of libertarians.</seg>
<seg id="13">At Turnbull building, however, it is not a recurring project: "We don't create a precedent," according to Steigenberger.</seg>
<seg id="14">The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bernried.</seg>
<seg id="15">Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at a cost.</seg>
<seg id="16">Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports support.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratet for examination.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau</seg>
<seg id="2">The Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is a new medical director at Schongau Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is due to the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, the landlady Andrea Jochner-White confirmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, a decision is made by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The vast majority should move with fishermen and the nearby station to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rooms are in place.</seg>
<seg id="10">The staff, who cannot go to Schongau, is to be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-White.</seg>
<seg id="11">The staff were briefed on the plans.</seg>
<seg id="12">The change was caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the question of who is to succeed, according to Jochner White, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch with his team to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the house in Schongau, this means, in any case, an "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine," according to Jochner White.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.</seg>
<seg id="16">Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases.</seg>
<seg id="17">For the next two years, Fischer with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until then next year the former hospital of the workforce, which still has more than 35 beds, to be closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until now, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean-up at Weilheim hospital has been completed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Landlady Jochner-White, who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board, joined rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, is to be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I conclude that," as it continues with the property, Jochner White could not say there were several considerations.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the moment there is a short time care for Caritas and a daily psychiatrics.</seg>
<seg id="22">"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the staff.</seg>
<seg id="23">A real perspective for the house, in which Fischer has worked as a chief medical officer for over 30 years, has not given up.</seg>
<seg id="24">He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take up the post of medical director.</seg>
<seg id="25">Peißenberg's hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.</seg>

<seg id="2">The situation in the German housing market is tense.</seg>
<seg id="3">More and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pressure on the housing market is growing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social housing is facing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">Distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.</seg>
<seg id="8">They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable homes.</seg>
<seg id="9">To meet demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a study commissioned by the association of "social-housing."</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, this year, 260,000 units are ready in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, 140,000 homes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long snakes in front of the rental flats.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany is shooting down a housing deficit, which is increasing from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, some 77,000 accommodation units have already been missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many professionals lived in WG rooms in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="21">Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slack in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the big cities, the number of square feet per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="23">To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" suggests a reboot.</seg>
<seg id="24">In doing so, new incentives are expected to boost social housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Thus, the basic income tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidised homes will be suspended.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax incentives are needed.</seg>
<seg id="27">The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already doing well in towns and cities.</seg>
<seg id="28">A good week after it was launched on Monday evening with EUR 184 million, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been called up.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now, the project could even be topped up.</seg>

<seg id="2">After Hungary there is virtually no passing, as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Zagreb announces that there will be no hurdles to travel across Slovenia to the north.</seg>
<seg id="4">The route is dangerous, however.</seg>
<seg id="5">Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister, and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="7">Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.</seg>
<seg id="8">The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.</seg>
<seg id="9">Following the isolation of the Serbian Hungarian border, there are hundreds of refugees left to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="10">500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television channel RTL reports.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the previous day.</seg>
<seg id="12">New laws, which came into force on the same day, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="13">Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.</seg>
<seg id="14">Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can go through and we are preparing for that possibility."</seg>
<seg id="15">These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, it is people who did not want to live in Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the morning, the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Most were media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="19">They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid.</seg>
<seg id="20">Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the Croatian border, the refugees do not cross border fences.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are other dangers for this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="23">Mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage.</seg>
<seg id="24">After Hungary, however, after the closure of the border, there are little more refugees.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday, police counted 366 recorded people.</seg>
<seg id="26">Just before Torture on Monday, it was still 9380.</seg>
<seg id="27">The new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.</seg>
<seg id="28">35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="29">Those convicted face sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.</seg>
<seg id="30">According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established "transseat zones" on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - of the most important passage of Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="31">Among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="32">On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees there.</seg>
<seg id="33">In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="34">According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country."</seg>
<seg id="35">The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.</seg>
<seg id="36">Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Röszke, workers started to clean up.</seg>
<seg id="38">They collected the rubbish that left tens of thousands of people on the roadside in recent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="39">Barricades have been dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt.</seg>
<seg id="40">No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Austria has only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="42">The country has also reinforced its border controls.</seg>
<seg id="43">As a result, the 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.</seg>
<seg id="44">In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of German authorities.</seg>
<seg id="46">On a regular basis, smaller groups of refugees have been found on foot.</seg>

<seg id="4">Because Germany had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and who chased the chatter along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the Near Passau.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the end of the day, we have forgotten our guests, with a snack and a drink.</seg>

<seg id="2">Konrad has all hands to do with the transfer of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="3">Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight.</seg>
<seg id="4">The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen-Banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">The chaos in the initial reception centre Traiskirchen has already come to grips with Konrad.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We don't have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he told his first success.</seg>
<seg id="7">Also, the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big whistle, said Konrad and praised the organizational "feat."</seg>
<seg id="8">The Interior Ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis-prone situation."</seg>
<seg id="9">In total, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 Quarters in this year's year.</seg>
<seg id="10">To meet the number, 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the countries, 15,000 of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="11">If there are more refugees, we can do it.</seg>
<seg id="12">"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.</seg>
<seg id="13">With the state's chief executives, he has already held talks.</seg>
<seg id="14">They would have assured him that they would still be able to reach out for the coming refugees.</seg>

<seg id="19">On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition, you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.</seg>

<seg id="22">In emergency times, it might not be possible for travel agents to have to comply with a certain amount of the towel or the size of the upper body.</seg>
<seg id="23">For a temporary period, "emergency standards" would have to apply.</seg>
<seg id="24">The fact that, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in accommodation, Konrad is based on his experience.</seg>
<seg id="25">I am an older gentleman who is not in the face of the falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="26">Persuasion is his main weapon.</seg>
<seg id="27">Konrad and Maier do not cause any costs to the Republic, as they declared themselves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Their number of employees want to increase them to three to four.</seg>
<seg id="29">So far, their own quarters have not been successful.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt</seg>
<seg id="2">The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called solicitors.</seg>
<seg id="3">This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether he expresses xenophobic, journalists are concerned about or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is cracking down on the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="6">And performs well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is also registered in the bearded Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.</seg>
<seg id="8">The New Yorker with the conciliatory is many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some in the 1200-square-foot place is over -ten corners with him.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kalltown's Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think this is somehow exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter style," says Simone Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="14">The native Kalltown has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprinters, to which alongside Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also coming to terms in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the king of hearts, he didn't bring it there.</seg>
<seg id="17">While there is respect for the family's performance, they also tend to believe that Trump is "already a bit of a big maul," Wendel says.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally loud the nickname, the Kallstadt in the perimeter, "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: The Angers, she says.</seg>
<seg id="19">So Trump is coming out of the village of the solicitors.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US.</seg>
<seg id="21">Foundations of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not include Trump because he was once held off without a permit, the director of the Institute for Forgotten History and Folk, Roland Paul, said at the film launch.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."</seg>
<seg id="25">This contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendant.</seg>
<seg id="26">It had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Like the pole, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").</seg>
<seg id="28">The grower, in retirement, looks more distanced from the Americans, "he's always so upbeat."</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he think Trump is coming?</seg>
<seg id="30">"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He never bothered about Kallstadt."</seg>
<seg id="32">The pension owner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter, mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit, which is generally good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I can't imagine that from Donald," the 68-year-old says.</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if he did not contest the election, because "who has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting issues than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as president?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My president isn't," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And, "the grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="40">Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, including in the US wakes up interest.</seg>

<seg id="15">The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of arrangers to the Rafters Erik Thomson.</seg>
<seg id="16">The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.</seg>
<seg id="18">The result last night answered this with a clear "yes."</seg>
<seg id="19">The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).</seg>
<seg id="20">Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia.</seg>
<seg id="21">The first half hour (17: 00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.</seg>
<seg id="22">The second half hour (17: 30 p.m. to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).</seg>
<seg id="23">On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour satte 720,000.</seg>
<seg id="24">Hot-Seat averages 620,000.</seg>
<seg id="25">The drop in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Chase Australia is a replacement for $1 million minute it did not manage to evade the McGuires show.</seg>

<seg id="1">The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?</seg>
<seg id="2">Secret revealed?</seg>
<seg id="3">Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unknowingly obvious who wins The Bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The woman, at whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The bachelorette, was wrapped in greatest secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before coming out of three two, you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's final</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women have missed out on lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods last rose?" could become their answers to the playoff, who won the heart of the bachelor's.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.</seg>
<seg id="12">"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarah) and Sams energies, I noticed that I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.</seg>
<seg id="14">I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry.</seg>
<seg id="15">They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the one."</seg>
<seg id="18">"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved to him," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">And when asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't know if I can say that," she said.</seg>
<seg id="21">I love the remaining girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.</seg>
<seg id="22">The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.</seg>
<seg id="2">Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after its move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open training day at the end of last year.</seg>
<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomatoes and it looks like a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a straight game as it did to the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Tomatoes trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt-Return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.</seg>
<seg id="6">Tomatoes continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rather than grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomatoes also boosted Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jarryd Hayne patted at a punt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vikings</seg>
<seg id="11">It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hayne left the pitch after the fumble fluke and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career</seg>
<seg id="13">"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hayne compared the lumber with his Origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal range led to a Try for Queensland.</seg>
<seg id="15">Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and post it on his Instagram.</seg>

<seg id="1">Outdoors voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="2">Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn column in major wallabies in the run-up to a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Otherwise, we will get disruption in the Bavarian education system."</seg>
<seg id="4">The holiday party of the Free voters will be held in the Lower Franconian Municipality until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, there were other main issues.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Election Meeting.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Of course, the subject of asylum will outsource the Klausur," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="9">"So it's not going to continue, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Election Chief.</seg>
<seg id="10">Rejected asylum seekers want to push off free voters as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="11">That's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.</seg>
<seg id="12">The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Bayern pushes off, others don't."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Because we need to become more effective."</seg>
<seg id="15">But national politics in big wallabies should not fall under the table.</seg>
<seg id="16">A long standing burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.</seg>
<seg id="17">As for the new school year, Education Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU), at 47 Gymnasia, launched the pilot experiment "mid-level plus," in which an extension of the high school average of three is tested by three to four years - as a result, it will take nine years to go to high school.</seg>
<seg id="18">But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The issue of G9 needs to be speeded up," the FW chief said.</seg>
<seg id="20">We call for freedom of choice for all gymnasts who want this.</seg>
<seg id="21">Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.</seg>

<seg id="2">Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.</seg>
<seg id="4">Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, resident district officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and firebombs.</seg>
<seg id="5">MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot in the air before pulling back on rubber bullets.</seg>
<seg id="6">Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.</seg>
<seg id="8">The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.</seg>
<seg id="10">At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since Oct. 10.</seg>
<seg id="11">August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.</seg>
<seg id="13">Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.</seg>

<seg id="9">Under pressure from the project critics and the FDA group that preached the investors and the administration, Ralf Behrend of the System-Bau-management board went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.</seg>
<seg id="10">But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project, which is around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.</seg>

<seg id="16">There is still no operator.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with Type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a sergeant to the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient, but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease-prone with a body-mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach ulcers and stomach mud - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, BMI remained among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those undergoing surgery, 36% solved the diabetes disease completely and at 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medical-treated group, in comparison, diabetes only dissolved at one per cent and partly at only about two per cent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results were in the controls of blood pressure, the triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation, average hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as you are reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to veteran researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reaching larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, it was among obese people who underwent an obesity operation, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years -- compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no advantage for survival among the surgeon's patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they've collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."</seg>

<seg id="9">"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, to be created for these Muslim countries," he insisted.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We must reduce the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 and turned out that the U.S. 's violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Four-fold increase from intake of hand disinfectants by children in last 4 years</seg>
<seg id="2">Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand-disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12, which report poison control centers, rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show how young people are disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Youths allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A kid doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectants) are those who are parenting.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange duft, which are very appealing to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hanging disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially in the case of young children, a few spritzer can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxic notruf Center at the University of Kansas, told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky go around, but people let these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzer from after strawberry flavored hangings in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult legally considered drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lopped her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand depressants outside the child's reach.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women died in Ontario women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their "gema" teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and served them out of her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police regarded the failed plan as "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.</seg>

<seg id="3">Hearts will fight SFA on charges of Neilson fighting and Warburton cautious in January new commitments that could destroy the Kader's unit</seg>
<seg id="4">Dons increase lead over Celtic on five points</seg>
<seg id="5">Adam Rooney's penalty shot in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons created a five-point lead between himself and Celtic.</seg>
<seg id="6">Griffiths plays down talk about Disharmonie</seg>
<seg id="7">There are rumours of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously dismissed by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased scrutiny as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch league leader.</seg>
<seg id="8">I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer</seg>
<seg id="10">The former Rangers-midfielder and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, as there is no title muscle with the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="11">De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they don't show highlights of the Celtics games more and why?"</seg>
<seg id="12">It's because the Rangers are not there.</seg>
<seg id="13">People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.</seg>
<seg id="14">You talk about the Old Firm.</seg>
<seg id="15">They're talking about both teams and that's what they're interested in.</seg>
<seg id="16">There's a lot of tension in the Old-Firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.</seg>
<seg id="17">I'm going to turn things around, swear Deila.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ronny Deila has accepted that Celtic have to fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the defeat to Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat against 10-man from Aberdeen, which now stands at the top of the table with five points.</seg>
<seg id="20">Deila, however, said: "Celtic have had bad times before and we will come back again."</seg>
<seg id="21">Now we want to get out there as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="22">I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.</seg>
<seg id="23">We feel the same - but we must continue.</seg>

<seg id="25">It is so important to come together now.</seg>
<seg id="26">Warburton cautious on January transfers</seg>
<seg id="27">Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which hinted that he was rushing some January transfers, Rangers-boss Mark Warburton is cautious in signing new entrants and insists he does not want to disrupt the unit of the Ibrox cadre.</seg>
<seg id="28">The ex-boss of Brentford said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."</seg>
<seg id="29">The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.</seg>
<seg id="30">The team is really good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.</seg>
<seg id="32">Celtics target Michu with withdrawal note</seg>
<seg id="33">Swansea striker Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in the conversation, has indicated he could withdraw if his contract expires at the Swans.</seg>
<seg id="34">The 29-year-old has been plagued with a troublesome ankle for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hearts set for SFA battle over Neilson's comments</seg>
<seg id="36">The Hearts led 2: 1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3: 2, but the defender's red card was later lifted - the third red card from Collum, which was revoked in eight months.</seg>
<seg id="37">Neilson remains what he said, insisting: "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."</seg>
<seg id="38">Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle</seg>
<seg id="39">The incorrigible Hibee was rebuffed after he admitted to having sung a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.</seg>
<seg id="40">The incident occurred in a pub in the area of Roseburn of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding: "It's safe to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."</seg>
<seg id="42">Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United-management</seg>
<seg id="43">Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the decline must end on the pitch.</seg>
<seg id="44">I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.</seg>
<seg id="45">We're going to get the guys back on track," Donnelly said.</seg>
<seg id="46">McInnes happy to win against Hamilton "unnicely."</seg>
<seg id="47">Derek McInnes conceded that his team from Aberdeen had to be desperately struggling against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive league victory that gave them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top edge of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty shot in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="48">McInnes said: "There's not a team that has won everything, in postseason games or leagues that games of this kind haven't won."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I am witnessing an executive in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see a man being brought to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I will be sitting in an audience gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the toxic injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day moved closer, I began to fear.</seg>
<seg id="7">So why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery will take place to decide who is elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who is selected will watch it emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit alongside Richard Glossips's closest friend, with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half hour visit.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we speak.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of abandoning my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here's the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the prisoner's story of how he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks it's wrong what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I said and wrote.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he was going to do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter present to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks the outreach effort will help against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to go back to all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from that perspective, I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters you can turn to.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the final straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for racing and he was finding himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tuck test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had been restrained for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like high-hanging grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I had nothing to say about this and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You know that it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'll go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk down the main street, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If they start thinking I don't, then I shouldn't be more coaches.</seg>
<seg id="12">I then have to consider what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earlier, Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stall.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Twenty months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is the case, they should certainly catch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulette, chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time, and are still today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should this make me think that it will be personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people are thinking out there that I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they'll have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, they're now thinking about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I've now got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">That makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The coach's frustration levels have been set up with the long-running Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said he "could throw his license across the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horseman, which violated the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have been last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have been the whole day the whole day, which was the way it was.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it also had it so on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day, an investigation into this matter has been opened.</seg>
<seg id="37">It's a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all see that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," Moody said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims to ring fight</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as an "Agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the umpires allowed the storm-fielding players to play "ring battles" with his team during the High Storm rally in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the storm-team after his team scored the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said they were focused only on their "contact" at Tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm-team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us 24: 2," Bellamy said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided the turnaround for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this time to come back to this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of a cockrower.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20: 18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are breaks, and no points, a bit of tension?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it's the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">When they mention us, it means that we are still going to meet them at one stage.</seg>
<seg id="26">The storm-team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preseason finals at AAMI Park, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.</seg>
<seg id="3">Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and lodged in Coomera in August.</seg>
<seg id="4">Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.</seg>
<seg id="5">Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.</seg>
<seg id="6">The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape danger at Maksimovic.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has clear relations with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia," he told the court Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the criminal case, he lied to police about his whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimov's mother and stepfather had offered bail of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After reading the audacious statements of the two people, it is clear that the circulation of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was released on bail, under the terms that he made his Australian and his Serbian passport, reported to the police daily, and kept to a curfew at 18: 00-06: 00.</seg>

<seg id="1">Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures</seg>
<seg id="2">A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.</seg>
<seg id="4">The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police took care and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "concerned" web search that used terms for searching indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it, as it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them."</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said he did it to lure them.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the trepidation and on the wines.</seg>
<seg id="14">She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confrontational the defendant.</seg>
<seg id="15">The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to speak with girls who looked much younger than him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to include indecent images of children on June 14 last year, on 25 January this year, against the conditions, and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">He was admitted to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the ruling.</seg>

<seg id="1">The crowd makes it: Every two years, the automakers on the IAA show their novelties.</seg>
<seg id="2">In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.</seg>
<seg id="3">Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: Around 28.1 per cent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone, according to the Motor Office (KBA).</seg>
<seg id="4">This is also reflected on the IAA (publication date 17 to 27 September).</seg>
<seg id="5">Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.</seg>
<seg id="6">One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at retailers in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.</seg>
<seg id="8">He belongs to the core of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this.</seg>
<seg id="10">Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, the Hesse offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 horsepower, to which, for the first time, there are also three-cylinder liners.</seg>
<seg id="14">Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first only as a fifth stunner.</seg>
<seg id="15">A second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which can also be seen on the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="16">And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA?</seg>
<seg id="17">Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra-competitor Mégane into the race.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the trade fair, the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth man in a conventional and an impressive sporting GT-version.</seg>
<seg id="19">In trade, he arrives early next year, then also as a combi.</seg>
<seg id="20">Infiniti: Quite new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.</seg>
<seg id="22">The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits perfectly into the brand's design line.</seg>
<seg id="23">The base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 horsepower.</seg>
<seg id="25">Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.</seg>
<seg id="26">The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.</seg>
<seg id="27">The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer's data at 170 newtonmeters (Nm).</seg>
<seg id="28">The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.</seg>
<seg id="29">DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ablegers were mainly hand in front of the front section: Here the fridge was redrawn and the changed headlights fitted with LED technology.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and integrated Apple's CarPlay for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, at the IAA in the compact class, a series of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.</seg>

<seg id="1">JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square feet of cell are degrading</seg>
<seg id="2">The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-detainee to the law enforcement agency Tegel, which had been housed in a small cell for months.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the judges, they can even hope for money if only a few days were locked up in the confined spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).</seg>
<seg id="6">As a result, an ex-detainee with his constitutional credentials was successful in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of ground floor between June and November 2009, and the toilet was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="7">After that, the man who is now back at large, according to his lawyer, has been moved to a larger cell.</seg>
<seg id="8">His oath of office, because of the indecent prison conditions against the country of Berlin, failed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court, rejecting the case for re-examination.</seg>
<seg id="10">You see the man's human dignity being violated.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chamber court now decides on level of compensation</seg>
<seg id="12">Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days jail days for compensation, compensation was given, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="13">Otherwise, "a clergyman of legal protection would be to fear the personality."</seg>
<seg id="14">The chamber court now needs to clarify the amount of money.</seg>
<seg id="15">The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.</seg>
<seg id="16">So they spoke only in April to a detainee compensation because he was naked in a cell.</seg>
<seg id="17">Degrading, according to a 2011 decision, also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had documented a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009.</seg>
<seg id="19">The then-plaintiff was hospitalized for three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.</seg>
<seg id="20">Berlin's prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of missing staff.</seg>
<seg id="21">Prisoners are therefore repeatedly trapped for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is rising, even thugs are supposed to have arrived because of the tense situation.</seg>
<seg id="22">According to the Department of Justice, 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We are creating this'</seg>
<seg id="2">The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is going on in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create this, and we create that."</seg>
<seg id="6">What is going on in Germany gives the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments annually - and for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's almost twice as much as previously built (250,000 homes).</seg>
<seg id="9">As a result, the lack of housing is, above all, affordable rental property: 60 000 to 80 000 social housing starts per year, and this particularly favourable housing will also apply to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from the current 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Far too little is that from the perspective of the Plague Institute: 80 000 social housing should be created annually, and the federal government would have to invest $6.4 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it is estimated that, in the long term, 55 percent of the birds in Germany can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them in their entry, criticising Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the recording company, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political change: From the work ban on refugees to the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there used to be a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as residency duty, which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In society, partly because of the shortage of skilled labour, there has been a majority view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of English.</seg>
<seg id="21">To date, there has not been a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The building of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the premier route to work integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin School Board has found that only a few winged parents give their children to the Kitchens, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it's only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes hand papers in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">Should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries, students without a German language are prepared in welcome classes on the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="28">But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stafford of the Berlin School Administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception to so far has been Berlin, the interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU), but has now abandoned his stance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permit or acquiescence do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seeker law when they start studying.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter, in principle, do not get a BAföG, as they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.</seg>
<seg id="35">Patient refugees have so far had to live four years in Germany to be Bafög-eligible, from 1 January 2016, this span reduced to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap must also be closed, however, by Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and Deutsche Studentenwerk.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should get BAföG immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new statehood relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which takes care of the newcomers in a professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="41">Rights also include duties.</seg>
<seg id="42">In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes a willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to end such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to be here, in Germany, forfeited," he said in Bavarian radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He suggested translating the Basic Law to Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will continue to be an issue for the whole of society in the future.</seg>
<seg id="48">This will also have to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination agency for a mere decade and a general equality law.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder scene showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for, and for international agreements such as the anti-racism convention of Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees so far, according to medical correspondent Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"As for man- power and capacity, we are creating that," he told the Daily Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, additional money must be channelled into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery urges all residents to hand out health cards equal to the registry.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.</seg>
<seg id="57">And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seeker scheme is proposing.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, doctors, in particular, create the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are worse off about their illnesses than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in clinics, but also in doctors' practices, interpretation costs would have to be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="61">However, it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic look.</seg>
<seg id="63">In the case of refugee children, for example, there are considerably more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV.</seg>
<seg id="64">With some of the other symptoms of the disease, German doctors would be able to learn from their training, according to Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasite beatings or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect," and as far as the doctors shortage is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps take exams again.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill, according to estimates by the Federal Foreign Office (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heart rashes and death fears.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong dreadfulness and emotional deafness.</seg>
<seg id="73">To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices, it usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, in the social authorities, specialist workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">Manege invites to dream</seg>
<seg id="2">With the new staging "passion," the Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art.</seg>
<seg id="3">The goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the Circus Probst in the manege on the brick wall invites you to dream.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Our passion is the circus."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Passion" - under this motto is the current manning stage.</seg>
<seg id="8">The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gift to inspire the family, therefore, is in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Juniper says.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Manegencocktail with a world flair," director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.</seg>
<seg id="12">50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer long tour can now experience this flair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to be relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ease and agility - with these words, they identify.</seg>
<seg id="18">Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and homogeneity.</seg>
<seg id="20">Balancing the wheel on a ball?</seg>
<seg id="21">For He Yuan no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little else and fascinated with her mobility.</seg>
<seg id="24">60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The animals belong to our family," notes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.</seg>
<seg id="26">Grievances in the attitudes of circus animals are all too often an issue in various animal welfare organisations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "It is not good for our animals, but we are not doing well."</seg>
<seg id="28">About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.</seg>
<seg id="29">The "four-legged artistes," as they are affectionately called, are forgotten after the possibility of any request from the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="30">We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the most important thing is to do well for the animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">Especially on their zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra, the family Probst is proud.</seg>
<seg id="34">The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walkway and nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst told me.</seg>
<seg id="36">The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.</seg>
<seg id="37">So there should be something for every visitor.</seg>
<seg id="38">"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all the heart of it."</seg>

<seg id="2">MR Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs early in the year.</seg>
<seg id="3">He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media.</seg>
<seg id="4">The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with Buhrott.</seg>
<seg id="5">Last month, they had ousted him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">The spokesman for the movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.</seg>
<seg id="7">"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">It warns the concerned MPs that immunity ends in parliament, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.</seg>
<seg id="9">The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts at the company's services.</seg>
<seg id="3">HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and its service business activities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The expected jobless rate leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="5">"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new HewPackard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who is to head the unit after the separation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.</seg>
<seg id="7">As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing previously unmet, integrated technology solutions for companies," according to a statement from the company.</seg>
<seg id="9">It divided a company founded in the 1930" s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.</seg>
<seg id="11">The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide better performance.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the pre-season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a bone that doesn't heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a bigger issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in touch with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is also developing an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation by Premier Hospital Ltd recorded 23 different conditions of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, which has recorded the most injury days.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a prospective period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilises, I'm confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger faces a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little breather," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites, passing through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked out at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendship</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove to be at a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miseruation (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they needed that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, of course, you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of communication on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifelike and successful, even if in reality the isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrine values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of inconsolate values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a far more profound effect on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The great thing about Friends was that this focus was placed on his head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, who was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to explore entirely their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As one employee of the telephone teacher explained to me: "my audience's role for people who feel depressed and self-morseless, really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old phrase "I am coping with it" has an enormous impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term response mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It clearly presents the little moments of men's friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">So much my objective outsider status over the phone to people in the eye of despair may also help, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference your friendship might make.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to advance to Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as PSG player, who launched the French champions, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualifying for the knock-out passes, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, while they got the points, it was not a classic game of Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was replaced later in the game against his home city team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2: 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to be perfecting over the course of the season," Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good omen.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the PD team that could hold a 2-2 draw at their own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was ousted by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wingman has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis's pass behind the team's defence, before he finished off to Johan Wiland, he finished off nicely in the long corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone believed that PSG would get a big win, that was disappointing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach that stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and, with a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield, pitched a difficult opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed wide to Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG himself admitted himself sometimes, with some mishaps and poor downpours, not least from Ibrahimovic, who was patched at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, whom Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, with the Uruguayan scoring his sixth season opener after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended all the thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland, from a short distance, to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low, before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi escaped a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="2">The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which is hit by one-day commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt-reduction plan.</seg>
<seg id="3">London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.</seg>
<seg id="4">The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn hits demand and wreaks havoc on markets.</seg>
<seg id="5">The issue of subscription rights brought down Glencore's share price at trading early Wednesday morning, a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="6">The stock jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.</seg>
<seg id="8">The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, representing a 2.4-percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group.</seg>

<seg id="2">World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015</seg>
<seg id="3">The FC Bayern clearly stood a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eight times Spanish champions, three times postseason winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club champions, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is staggering.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="7">"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Madrid won everything at the time, we did nothing," he tells me.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that also registered the FC Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="10">Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Rummenigge wanted to have me."</seg>
<seg id="12">Remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="13">Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch</seg>
<seg id="14">The change, however, did not materialise.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.</seg>
<seg id="16">Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I've played a great EM."</seg>
<seg id="17">"PEP told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."</seg>
<seg id="18">"With that, he got me."</seg>

<seg id="2">Matt Damon confrontted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown when that emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in reference to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.</seg>
<seg id="4">"When we talk about diversity, you do it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show," Damon asserted.</seg>
<seg id="5">Brown reacted shocked, with insulting disbelief and called "Hoo! WoW. Okay," when the actor's comments rallied from The Martian.</seg>
<seg id="6">Damon and Brown joined the show's producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I want to ask people to think about this - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said first.</seg>
<seg id="8">The only black person, and she's a nutter, beaten by her white pimp.</seg>
<seg id="9">The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the reigning rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing "in the end could give us something we don't want."</seg>
<seg id="10">After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded ahead of disapproval over Damon's comments.</seg>
<seg id="11">Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.</seg>
<seg id="13">Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement hit Black Lives Matter nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against Farens.</seg>
<seg id="15">In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Album still matt," (albums still have their meaning) he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.</seg>
<seg id="18">More recently, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have released a statement, in response to the issue of fox-news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.</seg>
<seg id="20">It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.</seg>
<seg id="21">Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional sports climbers and operating guide Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the grand prize of $1 million with home.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Competition Show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.</seg>
<seg id="4">During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the finals.</seg>
<seg id="5">To the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="6">Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed that challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or been alive," said Isaac E! About his pile of money.</seg>
<seg id="9">So all of a sudden... as I can't even imagine how that is, the future is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="10">The senior producer, Kent Weed, sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first ever to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.</seg>
<seg id="11">According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.</seg>
<seg id="12">"If there are more than one finalists, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.</seg>
<seg id="13">How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratification.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think he has any grudge about that.</seg>
<seg id="15">He's just so happy to have done what he's done.</seg>
<seg id="16">Crowds of awards he received from fans.</seg>
<seg id="17">He's such a great guy and a family friend.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is a hero for his children and his wife.</seg>
<seg id="19">Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."</seg>
<seg id="20">And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.</seg>

<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season wasn't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier, they were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All the wins are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three Runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game, and so I want to be very focused in the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first rbis since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was Martinez's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He has swung the batter well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He looked good at (stroke training), looked significantly better out of the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">With three Runs in the backside at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right Fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hardy overran wall, the only man he faced before the presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano, who tore the right-hander Drew Verhagen a Two-Run.</seg>
<seg id="21">With a pair of runners and the final rally at the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was that in the Major League leading 27 times this season that Plouffe suggested a double play</seg>
<seg id="23">After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall made an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, the right-hander stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.</seg>
<seg id="25">Detroit profited to the start of the game from an even non-movable Phil Hughes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been dropped from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After they got in the first of the leaderboard, Halpin gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, creating a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 track record with the Runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, which ended the threat.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers put in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a Two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"It was a big blow," said Twins-manager Paul Molitor.</seg>
<seg id="34">He didn't score particularly well, but he caught the right spot.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relever right-hander A.J.Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">At Hughes, there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez departed because of an injury to the throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="39">Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="40">With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.</seg>
<seg id="41">Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30</seg>
<seg id="42">He has been missing since August 20 because of a tie-up in the right hip.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday</seg>
<seg id="44">Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)</seg>

<seg id="2">After Germany, Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.</seg>

<seg id="13">The EU's interior ministers want to take a fresh start to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Given the strong refugee status in Germany, the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial acquisition and distribution of people.</seg>
<seg id="15">The federal government will manage this jointly with the countries, announced by Merkel late Tuesday night after nearly four-hour deliberations with the prime ministers at the chancellor's office in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="16">Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would receive it.</seg>
<seg id="17">But if you don't have a lead perspective, you cannot stay in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">This view was summed up in the round.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet.</seg>
<seg id="3">But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to get away from them.</seg>
<seg id="4">Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially Saccharose.</seg>
<seg id="5">Healthy are the exotic fruits anyway: In them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-cartin.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.</seg>
<seg id="7">When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell.</seg>
<seg id="8">The bowl colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious.</seg>
<seg id="9">They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.</seg>
<seg id="11">A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the coming night, in the valleys of the Alpine side of the hair dryer, as MeteoSwitzerland announced on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Wednesday and on the night of Thursday, the hair dryer partly blows with storm strength through the feisty valleys.</seg>
<seg id="4">After feisty on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front crosses us, bringing heavy rains, wind gusts and a temperature drop.</seg>
<seg id="5">As MeteoNews writes in a note, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Isles in a vigorous southwest.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the Alpine side, on the night of Wednesday the hair dryer will break through the valleys.</seg>
<seg id="7">As a result, the hair dryer will blow up by Thursday morning in the Farewell valleys with embankments of 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland, with more than 100 km/h.</seg>
<seg id="8">The hair dryer can penetrate into the adjacent Mittelland, and on the mountains can even be orkanes of more than 120 km/h.</seg>

<seg id="2">Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-square in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened the name of the German Reformist.</seg>
<seg id="4">On the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognized as the "German Theologist of the Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="5">The park is located in the heart of the old Rome, right next to the Coliseum.</seg>
<seg id="6">The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.</seg>
<seg id="7">Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Ossetian community in Rome, recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the pope over centuries as a minority were often only allowed to live in secret their faith.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the (gold-plated) Dornenkrone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with colourful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but in no way synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary: Adapted to the respective subjects, that can be quite bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of all books."</seg>
<seg id="10">There have been cycles that address themes such as cross paths, pranks, bids, or fatherhood.</seg>
<seg id="11">In doing so, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective Bible papers.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into the current context.</seg>
<seg id="14">These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original Bible treadmill by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his own personal thoughts on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewellery band has Golden Letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant missionary.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Because the education was already done with the cane," Otmar Alt recalls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I tried to work that out to help me cope again with the Lord's father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern is to regain the importance of art at the fastest time: "The perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising today, and that is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is being squeezed out there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different desire and cheek to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures always have something secretive and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" the images, let them look at them, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Old Foundation, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings."</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not care to fully capture the Bible, but chose the most important, also mysterious themes.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was not cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "Here we are talking about the images, the text merely explains," a picture Bible was created.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from Lutheran Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens at the Otmar-old Foundation on November 15.</seg>

<seg id="2">The DFB expands its commitment to refugees by 2019, the Bundesliga set a clear sign at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="3">Football responds to the worsening situation in Germany and secures its help in dealing with the problems that lie ahead.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I consider this to be the biggest challenge facing our country since reunification."</seg>
<seg id="5">"There's no one can say in principle that this doesn't matter to me, I don't have anything to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="6">"This has to be of interest to everyone, to get to grips with this issue," DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach said.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin, he is keen to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">"I am in the chancellor next Wednesday and meet the secretary of state, Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Because the issue will certainly play a central role," he announced.</seg>
<seg id="10">Football can and wants to help.</seg>
<seg id="11">The crucial course, however, must be the policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a Welcome" by four years.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Over the Egidius-Braim Foundation we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," said Mr Niersbach on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some federal officials also support this program.</seg>
<seg id="15">As early as this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will send out a clear signal if they are going to wear the pressure "We will help.</seg>
<seg id="16">"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Rangers sports director Rudi Völler of the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday), calling the project "self-evident."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one is allowed to look away."</seg>
<seg id="18">"We football leagues can, no, we have to use our blast, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hoffenheim's managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the EM qualifier against Hungary this Friday, the national team of women is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.</seg>
<seg id="21">Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community of German football."</seg>
<seg id="22">That all 36 licensed clubs would have started their own projects in their places is great.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active.</seg>
<seg id="24">The message "1: 0 for a Welcome" we spent is lived in football.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's of enormous importance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">In this year and next year, the association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, will provide EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="27">"The clubs have already retrieved the whole sum for 2015," Niersbach reported.</seg>

<seg id="1">Football: BvB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate</seg>
<seg id="2">At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League were finally broken.</seg>
<seg id="3">The national team will also be missing the league leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m./Sky).</seg>
<seg id="4">"We unfortunately cannot resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="6">Given the heavy stress of its pros, Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only on the Reus position.</seg>
<seg id="7">So he announced a switch on the goalkeeper position.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman Bürki.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whether Weidenfeller is used in the future in all Europa League games, however, Tuchel left open.</seg>
<seg id="11">With high probability, he will also play the second game.</seg>
<seg id="12">The foray statement by fellow players Reus that the final entrant for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, holding midfielder Julian Weigl for understandable: "This is Marco not so wrong."</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think we have a good chance to pick up the title."</seg>

<seg id="1">Robot cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany, according to the will of the Federal Government, is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the auto show IAA of a "new mobility age."</seg>
<seg id="5">Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams, Dobrindt said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Transport Ministry's strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">To test new technology, there is currently a test track on Highway 9 in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order for the driver to "not be saddled with any additional liability risks," the federal government wants the legal framework "to review and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."</seg>
<seg id="10">For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government also wants to apply for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far provides only for the people as drivers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the case of automated driving, the car takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the economic ministry, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">Still, driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be "only far after 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPL transport policy chief Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">A survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute of Forsa Institute on behalf of the Investigating Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 per cent do not expect it in 20 years, and 31 per cent do not believe it at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of those polled with autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the ride on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the motorway, that could mean 15 per cent in flowing traffic, in the traffic jam 45 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figurehead: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: Storefront pucks, which are alarmingly human thanks to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">They wear the French designer's spectacular creations, among others, with Madonnas stage outfits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Before it was tanned, now it's real," Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the visitors to the exhibition "From the Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the pavement on the catwalk), which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When you die, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is a superbly choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort was done: To frisk the dolls, for example, a stylist was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons of material have been mated by the makers, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just before the start of the October festival there was a special treat: A leather chair outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Gaultier's old teddy is also seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He stands for the designer's first, tentative fashionable walking attempts.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he was attracted to his teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">With a doll to play, his parents would not have allowed him.</seg>
<seg id="23">Throwing fashion, he later confessed himself to himself.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier said in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later, however, I bought it, then, of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first own fashion show, he has not been able to pay the models.</seg>
<seg id="27">They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clams.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewellery rather than Gardine - chatter top as fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around talking about making meters.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, for example, to distribute them to blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">This alone does not work anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespenter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the talking tip, fashion played a bigger role, then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt mentions some examples: Tip in jewelry, with accessories like bags and in regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which appeals to past Stilepochen, is an increase in order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, they already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Together with nine other companies, Modespende is a member of the industry association of Plauener Top and Stickereien.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some 80 per cent of sales have been broken in the last 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private trade deals, as well as the wholesale trade, almost no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products hardly reach customers in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bulk goods are made much cheaper in Asia today and almost exclusively distributed via chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover, exports are weakening, according to Russia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="18">So there are enough reasons for new paths.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg outsider of the Westphalian University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tips.</seg>
<seg id="22">To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">That takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is an area of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that, above all, have to think economically," says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design is often slightly different to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball.</seg>
<seg id="27">In some places, the machine stifles small kisses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The chatter goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krough was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional chatter."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure, she shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A lot of people in the region identify with the subject of talking tip - young and old," Reuter says.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also supplies to the U.S., to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in chat and surroundings and who want a souvenir.</seg>
<seg id="33">With that, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the talking tip.</seg>

<seg id="3">However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not about re-filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.</seg>
<seg id="4">It's about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family at a time of the Great Depression in England.</seg>
<seg id="5">Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.</seg>

<seg id="1">XI urged to open the economy wider for the world</seg>
<seg id="2">The economy needs to open more broadly to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday of a group tasked with steering reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving the strategies for business start-ups," he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Encouraging new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policies, support the state-owned enterprises (SOE), to borrow private capital, and overhaul the single-person reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The initiative is significant because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also loosen controls over the powers conferred on the companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors, further areas for private investment will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will not change its policy toward foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it is made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and making the application process easier.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to exercise their activities, and to employ professional judges and prosecutors, was also discussed at a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="15">The meeting also included Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement issued after the meeting.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU seeks to double mercury limit in predator fish</seg>
<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and give consumers a much higher dose of nerve.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant women and infants," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, major predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 per cent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 per cent would be unsettled.</seg>
<seg id="7">In exchange for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Foodwatch, however, called this "trick" because smaller gravefish, such as carp are mostly so low, that they are already meeting the planned highs today.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in small numbers is therefore "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which spreads heavily over the food chain, especially in predators.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal government therefore warns that "already small quantities can be particularly caused by unborn skulls of the nervous system."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Ministry of the Environment, on its website with regard to current levels, says that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively crossed," the "Mirror" was quoted from the paper in March.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.</seg>
