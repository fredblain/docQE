<seg id="1">In an emergency admits Professor of having shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb was important to emphasize the fact that his "sweet dog" but still alive and had probably excited and he said the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the home, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note which was scrawled on a white block: "I do it so sorry, I wish I could undo, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me. " This was reported by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who, taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he claimed to police a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, on the door has shot to his office and killed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18 AM.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb has eventually made the fateful emergency thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his own life when police him einkesselte.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shooting in the university, the students and teachers forced them to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">Published by the investigators at both ends of the state details, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped to paint a picture of a talented, but perhaps difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">Police in Gautier where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had Lamb mentioned in a written by him book in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses by both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014-15 to deal with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to a leave of absence for health reasons and said here that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor of him.</seg>
<seg id="21">University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that the Lamb can not answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing from the campus police found later Lambs track when he import again in Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, killed himself Lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb started in 2009 his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was the heartthrob.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted away when he was there, "Hairston said, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency Lamb said, "I have my wife killed", but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">Police said that the dog was fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and Blues played.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb struck Prentiss, when he and Abigail both occurred on a summer carnival three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later they played together the odd gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5 last after Lamb his guitar and harmonica ended had ended in front of a sparse audience.</seg>
<seg id="48">There were no signs that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were busy clearing and joking with each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, Don Allan Mitchell said, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night took about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members at a candlelight memorial service part.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the University Choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are trying our students to encourage them to return," LaForge said.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he Schmidt shot, and that lamb indeed called his wife in his emergency Prentiss, but there is no indication that the two ever got married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 polls, which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump of the top ranks in surveys down, it has not (yet) does not work.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump result in double figures, and begin some to seriously ask what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is too early in the election period.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts emphasize that at this time Rick Perry's leadership has been delivered to the ascending Herman Cain in 2011, of which none won only one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps perseverance and begin to make their dollars flowing to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some current poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumps popularity ratings have rotated 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey showed the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, there were 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In early August, it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six out of 10 Republicans a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers hold in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a survey conducted by CNN / ORC last week said 67 percent of Republicans, they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson manages approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 per cent say they would be "delighted" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand say 47 percent of Republican voters that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, the candidate would.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans do not see Trumps temperament problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and insulting statements, believe 52 percent of tending to the Republicans Irish voters that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number applies to the first code state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his duties, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, so ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters are getting used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If they put their scholarly hats, holding Republican voters Trump for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, say, after a survey by CNN / ORC from last week's four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change from the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the last cycle covered four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared with only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nevertheless, shows that a plurality of GOP voters Trumps campaign regarded as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if Republicans rallied to another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trumps lead, while the anti-Trump-Support is diffusely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a survey of Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump reaps the majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He plans Carly Fiorina 13 points clear, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally against Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A slight majority of Donald Trump fans says they have formed their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll by CBS / NYT shows on Tuesday that just over half of voters that support Trump, say that they have their voices permanently assigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, never change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to another candidate.</seg>
<seg id="50">Nevertheless Trumps strongest competitors at the moment the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion, are twice as likely for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump "rapist" called in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico, immigration was linchpin in public discourse to 2016th</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the bombastic phraseology of Trump decisive Hispanics will keep away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC / Post poll Monday said six of 10 Republicans, to coincide with Trump in immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it is Donald Trump do apparently.</seg>
<seg id="56">The frustration with the government climbed to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">now on Donald Trump and Ben Carson accounted for half of the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC / Post, they would rather a political outsider as someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey by Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated by the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".</seg>

<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of its six pre-defined questions shortly after noon, his power is checked by the media likely and the Labour MPs close.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The match will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyns guide because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech to the TUC annual conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader to persist on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a ceremony commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain silently, provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is the focus of several Titelseiten- Stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he had the "heroism of the RAF in the Battle of Britain" recognized.</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two's Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of Shadow Ministers have refused to serve top team in Mr Corbyns, and they rely on case differences in economy, defense and foreign affairs, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary Party initially supported him as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Political correspondent for the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences to "stack" within Labour and indeed by Mr Corbyns remarks about the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn said the TUC conference that Labour presenting changes to remove the whole idea of limiting total.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, said Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister that the party "very clear" is that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit from 26,000 to £ 23,000 £.</seg>

<seg id="18">The Islington North MP said that Question Time the Prime Minister is to be confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "repartee" and arguing with barbs and has resolved instead to serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people to concentrate.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He also has the idea mooted that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he had John Bercow, the Speaker of the House addressed, in order to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When in 2005 he was leader of the year, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the policy in the style of "Puppet Theatre", which is often linked to the question hour of the Prime Minister. But some years later, he admitted that he had failed in it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first sent in 1990 on television, Question Time has been viewed with the prime minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and needed far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash has Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi prepared to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets its relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media, as well as through events Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers jumping on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash more details of its defense strategy on 29 September published if the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor Strategy Day.</seg>
<seg id="7">Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts believe how Morgan Stanley that Aldi will snatch twelve months following the opening of its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two countries and all known actors, but mainly independent retailers sales will take away.</seg>
<seg id="10">A report published this week report, estimated the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016th</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocery store and in the quantities on Metcashs high fixed cost base could Metcash cost around $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Eastern countries, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent will reduce to 2020th</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash probably within a decade. will Metcash disappear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash declined to respond publicly on the comments of Mr Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash with Mr Douglass last week contacted.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAs market share has dropped since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailer, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins ,</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesalers defends itself by investing more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers in improving their shops by faster-growing fresh food and a better selection of private label to provide -Lebensmitteln.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programs are set to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return in 2017 for the first time in four years at a profit growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend nick kyrgios and earned the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy believes more praise than criticism for his own behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special K," fell through the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon after Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, said Harrison exclaimed, "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen, as he smashed a racket after a spasm foiled a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was defended staunchly Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing about which I quite envious me is the fact that in my opinion a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute," said Healy.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has a bat shattered when he lost because of a spasm in the US Open, but he is not the first player who has broken a racket in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he did extremely well behaved in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he was a little treat too strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and it fits in the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is good in form, it is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision Kyrgios not be included for the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but it affords the man from Canberra to, as a long-term integral part of the team return. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First, we want that the team is fully focused on competition and not to all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I believe that Nick has very quickly managed to climb what people like Federer and Murray have pointed. He rises in the public eye, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we will try to support him, we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable. Some time away from the spotlight, where he can only think about it, I think that's right, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.</seg>

<seg id="10">It must be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days ", Ivica Dačić said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turbulences on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels could agree on no common immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Minister, however agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in overpowered Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that finally - next month or by year's end - would achieve an agreement that the EU countries would further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Hungary placed his hopes not on a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The proclaimed emergency on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to tackle the crisis, so that they close off streets and could speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto meanwhile, said that his country also the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania plan to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has completed a fence on the border with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, used.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary has become for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most arrivals are economic refugees who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view sharply at odds with other EU countries, including Germany , stands.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came at midnight in Hungary in force, making crossing the border or the damage to the 4-meter (13 feet) high fence, which the government had built along the southern border with Serbia, to commit a crime. These laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation that has arisen through mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament must still approve the procedural use of the military yet, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporter saw earlier on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities 45 people while trying to cross the border caught, 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">You come over, by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and the commission of offenses under the new law are accused.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are going to repair the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a train wagon with barbed wire to close the borders, had arrived.</seg>

<seg id="1">halved Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll: Election-2016</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the primaries, say most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion, it is clear which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll has Clinton at a number of demographic groups lost while Sanders scored some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those projections have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is lagging behind with only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage in Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was before Sanders double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic voters say the primaries nationwide that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support only because it is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly impressed by it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic voters primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, say less Republican voters this via their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that they did (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time the right experience that a woman President (13 percent) and that they are the best candidate for the job (10 percent) is.</seg>
<seg id="20">From Clinton's supporters also their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Approval for dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president casts a potential run for president in the balance, want to see him in the race, 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries - although one third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If democratic voters the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, is Biden at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">From Clinton's supporters say more than half that Biden would be their second choice long before Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden opts not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton increases lead over Sanders, 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election; However, this figure of 78 percent has fallen in the past month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage who sees him as the "wählbarsten", has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, call Democratic voters questions about eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month stands not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters primaries emerged as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidate or potential candidate give good results in some important traits in voters of their party primaries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden cuts in the three candidate came out on top with honesty while Clinton's strength is leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters primaries see also generally Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all of these measurements has about a quarter of Democratic voters no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the tenure as Secretary of State continue to be made, most Democratic voters the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has their opinions in total not affected.</seg>
<seg id="37">But there is another story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion this was in March, shortly after the problem came to light split.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened by it.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have worsened.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is viewed by voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total: they see only 32 percent as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of the electorate do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time see 55 percent of the electorate nationally and Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy to.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades executive.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested cutting Biden, Carson and Bush came out on top with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with many Carson have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of Baruch College Freshman loaded</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a student during a vexatious ritual a fraternity in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania died, filed murder charges against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual introduction in September 2013 brutally and delayed his journey to hospital, which has contributed to his death, police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he had been debited blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and have been repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach out to a target on a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number 911, after Deng passed out and waited allegedly an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to police.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they have had time to change clothes Deng googling his symptoms and Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to contact for advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the fraternity principle about Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">After an autopsy report Deng were repeatedly inflicted blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student died since 1970 every year to the harassment," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a murder charge third degree for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng are also accused vexatious attacks and criminal association.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We do not only make the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization - formally or informally - has sanctioned this, so we will hold accountable those," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership in the local group.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know this.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know how long all this and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, has the history of the economy little guidance on the conduct.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, representatives of the US Federal Reserve have so vigorously emphasized that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, at the end of market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated for a rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably by some as a signal for the end of the era of" "be interpreted" cheap money, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low level to cause seismic shock, many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a based on historical trends look at how some sectors of the economy might react:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the past month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things for a while volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once the increase is received, the effect is not as dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a tendency that investment income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase be stalled, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said German Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after rate hikes by the Fed ,</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is in the last 35 years mostly on the rise - about 14 percent - on the way to raise interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis, published Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset management in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">The German bank said that the impact on the stocks tend to occur later in the cycle and increase the yield begins to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes they promote often.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most notable here is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point will be at a rate hike by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to German Bank nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, expect just that this will continue and expected for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Increases in interest rates at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question, "whether this time is different," the German bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have made throughout the year in for a rate hike by the Fed, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session, the futures trading shows only a probability of 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all increase cycles have occurred from 1950 to the present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs made very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows", the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is a unique slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect of bond is faster than stocks when the change its strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, yields seem to change direction when the first increase / reduction is performed in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle increasing bond yields fall immediately, the German bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">The strategist with Charles Schwab believe that the rise will result in interest rates means that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High yield bonds often bring in such a climate better yields, although "we are careful not to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones said that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened their strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large, are companies which conduct a large proportion of their business in the United States, benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with large debts are worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market as well as to finance their debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded company with weak balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their shares outperformed their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 each (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debts are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure equity Games consumers will also benefit by the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">B & Q Boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over</seg>
<seg id="2">Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury</seg>
<seg id="3">The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe rise behind</seg>
<seg id="4">This means that 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at craftsmen, be opened</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide</seg>
<seg id="6">By Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent for the Daily Mail</seg>
<seg id="7">It is claimed that Britons their hammers and brushes in favor of the use of eligible Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home resign,</seg>
<seg id="8">If you can deal skillfully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls, you are now apparently a minority.</seg>
<seg id="9">For Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out DIY jobs in their homes, so the head of the company behind B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="10">Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the DIY chain, said that offer rock-bottom prices to a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, the services is now obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore Kingfisher plans to open 200 more stores Screwfix, addressed to artisans and to close 60 outlets from B & Q.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs. Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.</seg>
<seg id="13">Right now outweigh the men among employees.</seg>
<seg id="14">They said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who make more renovations than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs. Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move this more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Basically, half of our customers are women, 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a major role in the decision process.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a British listed in the FTSE100 index leader, also has her top team umstruktiert to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company that has gone to women exactly 50 percent of the team, including its management and CFO.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profits and revenues after the group shouldered the cost of closing the shutters.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because the trend is Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q has, open 200 new stores.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Landesgericht Klagenfurt two functionaries of the Austrian Volleyball runner-Aich / Dob who must answer for embezzlement and tax evasion on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The defendants pleaded not guilty.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them was also charged with abuse of office.</seg>
<seg id="5">From this accusation he has been acquitted in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current trial was postponed.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Attorney General Robert Riffel had emerged during the preliminary investigation that the defendants used from 2006 to 2011 funds from club accounts over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes over the years.</seg>
<seg id="8">He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sports officials are also accused of financial offenses.</seg>
<seg id="10">This fact separated the chairman of the Senate lay judges, Judge Michaela Sanin, from.</seg>
<seg id="11">It should be negotiated at a later time.</seg>
<seg id="12">To discard the infidelity outlined the defense that the association at no time a financial loss arose.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sports officials have charged only expense allowances and the Sports Club, for which they have been from 1982 worked until 2011 and in which they have invested much time and money, led out of the debt - (. Around 44,000 euros) is liabilities amounted in 2001 around 600,000 Schilling ,</seg>
<seg id="14">"Back then we were faced with the situation: we run the club further or we lock on," said one of the defendants, in bread professional wholesale auditor of the tax office.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his colleague and co-defendant he had then decided to take on this task.</seg>
<seg id="16">With all the risks.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We have advanced to money, our life insurance laid as collateral with the bank," he said at the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="18">The club had been agreed: You can manage the money freely, it may only be made no debts.</seg>
<seg id="19">the payment of allowances success been retroactively decided until 1991 - Further is - with appropriate financial.</seg>
<seg id="20">Had therefore been a part of the expense allowances until years later, as was an increase in the account namely from 2003, is paid.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hence holiday packages and not detailed charges appeared on, explained the former chairman the operations.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accounts and savings accounts managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why the payouts were the club not disclosed in detail, asked the judge.</seg>
<seg id="24">The association did not interested in the detail required for financial management, important is only the debt freedom have been the answer.</seg>
<seg id="25">As in 2011, investigations began against a functionary for abuse of authority, a sum of 120,000 euros was paid into the association's account.</seg>
<seg id="26">The reserves were declared the accused.</seg>
<seg id="27">This securities account was in the name of the second accused and according to his statement the club was not known.</seg>
<seg id="28">"Why?" Asked the judge.</seg>
<seg id="29">Then the respondent knew long answer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then he finally said he had believed that this was the best for the club.</seg>
<seg id="31">If something had happened to him, no one would have known some of that money, put the prosecutor in the room.</seg>
<seg id="32">The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified.</seg>
<seg id="33">This transfer has been formulated as "reparation".</seg>
<seg id="34">Why Schadensgutmachung wanted ?, know judge and prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="35">Then told the first defendant, he was not in agreement with this formulation because the club no loss has never arisen.</seg>
<seg id="36">But what should I do, if the lawyer says: "By you all off the hook".</seg>
<seg id="37">"Am I a legal representative?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, the official said that he had never obtained a penny salary, he had netted only mileage allowance and diets.</seg>
<seg id="39">On diets he had the association asked 1,000 euros per month in account is the actual expenses but have been much higher, he added.</seg>
<seg id="40">Exact documentation of the early years could not produce the defendants.</seg>
<seg id="41">These were no longer kept to a tax audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, they said.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mileage allowance had taken the second defendant.</seg>
<seg id="43">All fixes are made in cash, in addition he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he said in his statement.</seg>
<seg id="44">The trial continues on 23 September with the hearing of witnesses.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it is still hard</seg>
<seg id="2">On Pakistan to push in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad, England has selected for the tour you can see a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out an away win.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin player in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they are no scars of 2012 Calendar, only a teen-positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball to Moeen Ali developed as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Thereafter related message: Adam Lyth is leaving the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, the decision to leave out Adam Lyth is, for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and is the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared to results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said before this - players are their own best selector.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago, one would have extended the run of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he knocks out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if it did not yield as good performance, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time gets a Test batsman to put his mark is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton nine got.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to home and away games.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only reproach which one can raise, was that England first Jonathan Trott began in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman, the I value highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">He's an X-factor Cricketer what we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored on a Trent Bridge Place 236 against us, which was very hit us.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must have at least the same opportunities as the get in front of him, but this of course depends on the team's formation, in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea to propose Moeen beside Cook what an extra-spin bowler and provide four Quicks would receive, appeared, and I do not mind.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a batsman there can not be beat, and the left-handed has already shown that he's a hotshot Cricket Player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen might have his job for his County Worcestershire not done, but it is a number 3 on it, and since there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drop before it occurred 2001 as opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People look at possibly its statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - think and it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and have the coach opted for youth ,</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn on this tour a lot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team England has made some clever additions at the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as advisor for the test matches could be a champion coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys of the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt already that it is designed for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room, even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the one-dayers, Root received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem on my part with it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but coaches and team stand not to specify the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you must remember that their jobs depend on the outcome as the players.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken lightly.</seg>

<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU, it is now time and not always their own fault, Britain created Agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, they usually do not want to be sick ,</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they also do not like when they threaten social protection.</seg>

<seg id="7">Prime Minister and Finance climbing summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local variables, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend who wants a-sighted outside Britain inside the EU tent - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and lets slip that more and come more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point are, where they do not care whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's 10 years in power and wants to leave the office before it bad for her looks as in the exaggerated long persevering as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and carbon (16) is done.</seg>

<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-British, whose power would be better used for preventing Scotland exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, you may plan some such ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments, quite the SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union process, suspected my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a disaster" and "Britain has not won anything of value from the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on their costs and what Eurosceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did not had it during inspired by Tony Benn referendum in 1975 that our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1 supported.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can faintly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-Euro-opportunist who has made a name for himself as an "EU-straight bananas' Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all his madness knew Ed Miliband, who were his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included the medley of tax-fearing villains Phone chopping foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that, if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better bananas distributed to distract him, instead of being to his lunch, and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he Camerons referendum vertebrae opposed because Blair had put the principle about not adopted the EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving it thus a backdoor opened.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has also never forgave him.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the cute Jeremy Corbyn, the Westminster a friendly pat on the back gave me on Monday - I told him that he need not waste any more time for me - seems in danger, Neil Kinnock boycott Murdoch strategy 80s to repeat a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to attract the media, not to me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyns official position on Europe is - I press it times out nicely - in development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, most people outside Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the wilder realms of Torys small Engländerismus can say yes to each well.</seg>
<seg id="29">It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said this week on radio and television, as the Scouts fought in it, not admitting that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father on television therefore tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his Cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilary's fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MPs and by all accounts at their meeting on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever wants to convey the sentimental bottom-up Image Corbyn - remember that he has stirred even me - Message discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and, above all, in the vortex of social media a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe, which allowed him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, like McDonnell said it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities towards EU membership - in accordance with its Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for the narcissism of small difference, a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC does not start a campaign for the exit - will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superiors at home foreign diplomats.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin political capital waste, - they have a mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if anything can be meaningless?</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), located Lancet joined by criticizing evidence of Public Health England (PHE) used in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "Policy Report" last month, describing him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data in question and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE explained his main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the allegations "are based on rock or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies on the demonstration of efficacy is based should."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that "is the current best estimate that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking," is based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who have been called to a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to develop to their opinions about the harms of various nicotine containing products to result in a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting a company called Euro Swiss Health was its CEO earlier by British American Tobacco Central (BAT) should have received for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also wrote the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants said the meeting, to obtain funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the financing, he is said to have previously obtained, according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not supplied, but can include several well-known E-Cigarette Champions, some of which specify an industry financing in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting, the tobacco pipe of PHE participated.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research group "admits characteristically" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are used as a way to smoke for children or Non smoking" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that has already responded to the allegations of BMJ previously.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifetime smokers die of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison to, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence is and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Almost 80,000 people die every year from an illness related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">The clear presenting of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking represent, we fulfill our national responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not transmitted by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for being to place public service programs that are likely to see a smaller audience in hard controversial time slot against the popular shows of their rivals and from channels like BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4, unsuccessfully, to come into contact with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are or sends that would also shown clearly by non-subsidized rivals in order," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the license fee, which I medium or long term not consider it a good idea, you should give its production at least on programs that others do not, or in order.</seg>
<seg id="8">Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for its future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax programs financed, which could be financed without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">would Honestly other channels give their right arm for.</seg>
<seg id="13">I struggle to see how this public television should be.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not think that this would reduce the BBC ever.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a contractor for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 headed, said that the BBC was responsible for chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. "</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the most popular programs of the BBC give back what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public niche programs should go to BBC4 "where you pretty much the audience can not measure, but they carry out their tasks, and they can argue when their sanctimonious missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcast fees go, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."</seg>
<seg id="18">Place it in a window of time in which no one would ever see.</seg>
<seg id="19">For broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think, we all think that one here gets a great value for £ 150 per year, but for people, which is a lot of money for the £ 150, wonder if that's true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who testified on Tuesday before the Committee, demanded that the BBC should reconsider its Reithian mission, "to inform, to educate and entertain".</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be and the public television channels in Australia Canada is an example take this change in "inform, educate and entertain".</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of partnerships said Elstein, the BBC should do more. In areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of TV show, and go with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">Change the tiny nematode, the direction in the moment in which they are using sound pulses which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard, irradiated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by switching on of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">More on this topic: Read researchers and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, can be used in the ultrasound to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace the depth brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease gives ,</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematodes usually respond not on ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found out that amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures that TRP-4-called ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To provide ultrasound-guided nematodes, altered genetically Chalasani the worms so that carry some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">If he uses ultrasound to changing creatures that sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the amended motoneurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The method has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists neurons switched with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue without hindrance and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low income</seg>
<seg id="2">The companies and Markus Gildner builds in Middle Franconia Eckental detached for people who do not have much money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So as for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and the low paid."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'll show how to build low and well even today," the 44-year-old said in an interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project Townhouse for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Gildner, many refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people remain to a large extent here.</seg>
<seg id="11">Given the influx of refugees, we need enough housing in the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very banal, three-storey townhouse is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A detached needs the least space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different when one brings people into residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that are built just in the pilot project, consists of three units, each for four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">How high are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 EUR, excluding land.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months lasted the construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">That's reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do the building codes complicates their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: building laws I pulled my project properly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Particularly complicated is making it increasingly the threatening sword of Damocles Sonderbau and Pitch Regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still assumed, who creates in a detached three apartments, needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in cities lacking for the place.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents respond to her townhouse project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: It is true but we had in the last five years a construction boom in Germany but were constructed luxury apartments that hardly anyone can afford longer.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, even the ordinary people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low paid.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how to build low and well even today.</seg>
<seg id="40">It's all about this.</seg>

<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried Wednesday morning at the site investigation in Horgos still calm: He considered the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not currently involve very high number of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="41">One could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternate routes are marked by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not without risk: In parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war Croatia still not cleared minefields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of deminers was sent to the border region.</seg>

<seg id="1">mixed FedEx earnings, lowered financial outlook for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for a whole year because of lower demand for cargo services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stock fell 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit of between $ 10.40 and $ 10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts had expected according to a survey by FactSet $ 10.84.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower view comes despite the price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and 4 January to take effect and, despite higher charges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that are applicable from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said it still expects the result compared to last year will increase due to cost reduction, increased revenue, and due to the growth in online trading itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade, in consideration".</seg>
<seg id="11">Plans for the Self-employment was a day later than that of rival UPS announced the plans 90000-95000 additional workers to adjust approximately the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">During the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than last year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $ 2.42 per share, just behind the $ 2.44 per share, the twelve surveyed by Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenue rose 5 percent to $ 12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six interviewed by Zacks analysts expected $ 12.23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has made in recent years, a decline in international priority shipping, which brought sales in its unity Orders to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales increased during ground by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packets and auto insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares were down $ 3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $ 150.15.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table in order to decide whether it's time for the first time in nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Threatening is above them at one end of the ornate, two-story courtroom a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: keep maximizing US employment and prices here stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the great recession the Fed leaders recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X-factor is a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus by the lying close to zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the data of the economy show that it grows strong, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and even if only by a quarter percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of interest is the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed will do what insecure in themselves the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the financial markets expect the Fed Waiting, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to a decline of the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless that strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she does, "she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets, so they do not panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">A month ago, the Fed seemed on track to set to increase by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said in spring and early summer, that they that more economic progress would be needed this year, despite the complaints of liberals, expecting an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the creation of jobs in August slowed, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation constantly proceeded with the annual target of 2% of the central bank, said the Fed's representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tightening of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world jumped end together last month, after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its peak, feared as investors that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curb global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered slightly this month, the Dow is now up by almost 10% below the May high.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed's representatives the turmoil affecting the complex calculation when they should raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks had not occurred, it would in this session the reins tighten," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">He predicts that they'll wait at least a month to get the effects better grip.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so they should be technically involved in their decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end the Fed monetary authority in the world has become.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere statement of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion, sparked confusion from around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, can be expected from the Fed representatives, that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to a better understanding of the to obtain global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Your decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., Noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are not associated with apparently with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de's commitment to raise interest rates, citing decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited discernible effect on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the Fed's representatives made these cuts reversed.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put questions of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the collapse of the market in 2008 in the first place, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the interest rate down the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil do not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You will not surely fall into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and did not mention the financial stability, and to the changes, I do not think that they should run ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="8">The New Yorker with Föhnfrisur many is a term in the wine-producing village on the wine trail.</seg>
<seg id="9">Many in the 1200-inhabitant city is akin over tens corners with him.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think the following is somehow exciting, but are in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.</seg>

<seg id="16">For king of hearts he did not put there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Whereas there is respect for the work of the family, but also tend to think that Trump "has a bit of a loudmouth" was said Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally loud the nickname Kallstadt have within, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the informer, she says.</seg>
<seg id="19">So Trump comes from the village of informers.</seg>

<seg id="21">Cornerstone of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: Your desire to return permanently in the home, was denied by the Bavarian State to which the Palatinate then belonged.</seg>
<seg id="23">He had Trump not included because it was once cut down without permission, the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul had declared the film's release.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of "illegal immigrant".</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had repeated derogatory talk about Mexican immigrants in the United States and the construction of a border wall required to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Just as the rumbles, is not so appealing," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trumps ( "The grandmother was born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").</seg>
<seg id="28">The winemaker retired sees the Americans rather distant, "he is always so short-tempered".</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he believe that Trump is not?</seg>
<seg id="30">"I can not imagine," says the 72-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He has never cared about Kallstadt".</seg>
<seg id="32">The landlady Veronika Schramm mentioned some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family something donated during a visit to the church organ, which arrived in general good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I can not imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="34">They think it would be better if he did not gain the election because "who has such radical views, I do not know if that's good."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those in the United States were in charge at the time of his grandfather, would have been like him, "he would be there even never arrived".</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting subjects than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Buhler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as president?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My President, it's not," she says.</seg>

<seg id="4">Some coaches have banned for the rest of the game on the bench, as he so lost a scramble, as did the Aussie rugby league convert his first punt return during Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota Hayne.</seg>

<seg id="7">Instead his rookies before the rest of the team to grind through the mill, he encouraged them.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tomsula strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.</seg>
<seg id="9">The 49ers sportscaster Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and to take care of the next game.</seg>

<seg id="14">Hayne compared the blunders with his Origin debut at that time in 2007, as a pass resulted in his own in-goal area for a try for Queensland.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetic weight loss surgery may be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight Loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, have obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes proved to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you want to calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study in 2007 used for the new study and compare between two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI remained at those non-surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal in 29th</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who underwent surgery, the diabetes disease broke up at 36% completely and 28% partially.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically treated group of diabetic dissolved compared to fully only in one percent and partial only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Moreover, the results in the checks of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group remained however stable at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - how is reflected in the level of hemoglobin A1c improved - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% vs. 2.1%) and showed more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study was obese people an obesity surgery underwent, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35, who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower", without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight to be taken seriously, as soon as the patient lies with his BMI 27 to 30</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies with obesity and diabetes firmly connected, a reversal is really hard. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was already the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approached, I began to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way, the whole story about the death penalty to tell.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and often there are more applications than places available, there will be a macabre lottery to decide who is elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has the number of media seats reduced from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is chosen, it is observed emotion.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can not do this.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'll sit next to Richard Glossips tightest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a half hours visiting.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist, so I shall be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and for access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have been better formulated" but she still thinks that it is wrong what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things that I have said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter is present to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement will help against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">Please, if you want to know more about the case, you will hear the series of podcasts that I have made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I will not go into all the details again.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary indeed.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to warrant a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective, I will watch him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I can not claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters to whom you can turn it.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me, is what it is, an unnecessary death dying to see a man.</seg>

<seg id="2">Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install last year a spy in his barns and threatened to finish the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria, claiming that because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, led by a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching Lady Tatai.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found in difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris that he can not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had 18 months held back because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like too high hanging grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I had planned nothing to say, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that all comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know that it went on.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.</seg>

<seg id="18">If me bring to the view that it is personally?</seg>

<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Maybe people think out there, it's me.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to take away my license and cast me, and I have no doubt that what I say, they can now think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I am now arrived at the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">That makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will exert the pressure on them and urge them to come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The frustration level of the coach have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he "could take his license over the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for its preparation of an undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the Race Day-treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horse's legs had been applied, which was against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It's against the rules of racing.</seg>

<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling his players as "agenda-setting" of two Premier League favorite NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have the Storm players "wrestling" allows his team during the high-Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "prime example" of Rugby League, saying that not "too good" were the two from Queensland in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the Tacklimg his team and said that they are focused only on their "Contact" at the tackle.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the review of two leading trainer at his team confident vote him because it meant that they were concerned to be hit by Storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"This comes up again and again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when she 24 us: have 2 hit," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have changed nothing defensive in our system or the techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks we have made a real focus our contact in tackles, and has provided the turnaround for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is now three years there, and he obviously has to train a great team. It is therefore probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this keeps coming up this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has Bennetts idea of "exciting football" attacked and remembers his mentor because Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said that he would not give a shit about.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and which we consider interesting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the ball game that you want to play when you have these types of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his own way of playing football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build more confidence, because they say these things, because they are a bit worried having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The play of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not considered it, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20:18, there were two further attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are making breaks and no points something exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me it is the match schedule.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they mention us, it means that we will meet in a phase of it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to either North or the receiving Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at Vorfinale in AAMI Park. Ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="4">The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">She saw it through, was the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.</seg>
<seg id="6">Police cared and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that have been found at the address and discovered "concerned" web searches, used the terms to search for indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed against the officers that he did it because it "would lead pedophiles on the Internet" to and he "pretended to be a police officer, to frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted that the searches were performed on the computer from him, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare predators.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that he did it to lure them.</seg>

<seg id="13">Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and the wines.</seg>
<seg id="14">then you saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it.</seg>

<seg id="16">Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty to the indictment, to have taken indecent images of children on June 14, last year, to have violated on 25 January this year against the pads and not in court for a hearing to be published on 24 March this year.</seg>
<seg id="17">Defense attorney Gregory Sim asked that Hogg will not appear in the sex offenders' register, since one could argue that was to be found "no significant sexual element" in his offense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October in order to obtain background information on social work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg has been granted in this case deposit, but was kept in custody for hearings on other cases pending.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is committed to meeting them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum applicants are in this year, according to forecasts of the Ministry of the Interior to Germany, according to statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany even able to take a million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated, given the unusual challenge determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do that."</seg>
<seg id="6">What to expect Germany, provides the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">be used by different forecasts between 350,000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) flats a year - and the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's almost twice as much as is being built to date (250,000 apartments).</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically the lack of housing is above all at affordable rental properties: annual fall 60000-80000 social housing out of rent control, and to this particularly favorable apartments also refugees apply.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Far too little is from the perspective of Pestel Institute: arise need 80,000 social housing units annually and it takes the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion a year to invest.</seg>
<seg id="12">Agreement among scientists and Bundesbauministerin are that it must also give more tax breaks for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research is assumed that in the long term, with 55 percent of the fugitives may be employed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees were not systematically asked in Germany to their qualifications to help them get started, criticized Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">but is crucial for the integration of refugees, whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of migrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany there has been a change of regime, according Thränhardt: the ban on working for refugees to recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, this the applicant was reduced in November 2014, three months as well as the residence obligation, limited to a residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">the view of the majority prevailed that refugees access to the labor market should be made possible faster - In the Company has - also because of the shortage of skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major hurdle for access to the labor market are missing knowledge of German.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far there is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies also show that most jobs are mediated by personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The development of networks is therefore the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to work integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school directorate has found that few refugee parents give their children to day care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is once very important, keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, distributed management handouts in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">Should the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise sharply, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by allowing more schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries students are prepared without knowledge of German welcome classes to teach.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">In them there is no shortage, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school directorate.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle prohibits any State applicants or tolerated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin's Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has his attitude but now abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studierwilligen refugees could access to college easier.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permit or submission to get any benefits under the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz more when they start studying.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter basically get no student loans because they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled BAföG.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tolerated refugees had previously lived for four years in Germany to be BafÃ¶g entitled from 1 January 2016, this margin reduced to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">but these funding gap must be closed, ask Steffen Barney, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should immediately get student loans.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law evolve to a new state-religion relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">Important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, the professional care of the new arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rights include duties.</seg>
<seg id="42">Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and should have some control options.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes the willingness to bravely combat religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday concern religious conflicts could be carried into them by Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany, "immediately have their right to stay here, forfeited in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He suggested that the Basic Law to translate in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration is much more than today in future be an issue of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="48">This also explains the majority society will have to change, is the eradication of discrimination and racism more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for nearly a decade, an anti-discrimination office and a General Act on Equality.</seg>
<seg id="50">But he learns very slowly, as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and stakeholders not white German have long been demanding and what international agreements such as the ICERD Germany undertake, must become a reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - to benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">Generally Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees medicine, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"Concerning Man- power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Tagesspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, should it flow into the system additional money.</seg>
<seg id="55">To avoid bottlenecks, calls Montgomery, all comers equal hand over health card when registering.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services provided may be charged later with the provinces.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long term it is highly questionable to fob so many people with the limited catalog of services, the providing for the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, go to work the doctors, especially the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">Even before this, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated migrants are poor aware of their disease than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in hospitals, in doctors' offices would interpreter costs are covered, she asks.</seg>
<seg id="61">Helped would many refugees but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency departments.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic view.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children as there were significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it related to HIV education.</seg>
<seg id="64">With the partial other conditions would German doctors of their education here but clearly says Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasites or tuberculosis are not as difficult to detect". As for the shortage of doctors, whether by refugees maybe even relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed educational system, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">However, to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their competence and perhaps again take exams.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized arrives in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering, among others, so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, strong startle response and emotional numbness.</seg>
<seg id="73">To prevent that symptoms would chronically, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees received psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although can mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services make a request for psychotherapy, but processing takes usually several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, would in the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness, decide whether a treatment is necessary or not.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to Wilshere, that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario is already that Wilshere sure at least the next four games for England will miss and, given its history is its participation in the next summer at the European sure still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had strong finishes last season after a separate ankle injury and had then found back again to his old swing during preseason.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's a bone that does not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is no more matter.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in connection with his knuckles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the inherent risk of further injury, always when a player tries to return in mid-season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also developed an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd. listed 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most days of injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement will continue in the injury rate during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the way he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger makes a rotation within the teams.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to indulge a little breather," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo are unbeaten after 41 games, after which was launched "invincible" campaign last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal has the doctrine drawn from the last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope, with his management team to lead to his first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were in 2006 very close to it, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends Festival: the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, is now made more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013 it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to tackle the issue, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) of 2015 as the year of the man who, with the aim of placing culture at issue that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy atmosphere" had his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, halved, a group of sane friends the risks of mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">Of course, one must first have friends so a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the era of guided through social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, doubled, although in reality dominates the insulation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all intrinsic cost values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects much deeper on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And like a video game creator billionaire recently declared, money can buy happiness not really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality that shone through the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross by Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often hold back fully their feelings to explore.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telephone counseling it told me: ... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are, I really shown clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying, "I come so rightly" has a tremendous impact, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It presents very clearly the little moments of male friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">Like My objective outsider status over the phone to help people so much in moments of desperation and that long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the honor of the day completely redesigned backdrop, why do not you take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk with.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better yet, if you see someone sit in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria hits to help PSG to crush Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmo.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, helping PSG to overtake Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the game and the response to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League started the season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but after they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute scored with a header.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish champions as they strive not just to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class match of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed opportunities in front of goal. He was later in the game against his hometown team and to the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999, substituted.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League Therefore, it is a good start. 2: 0 win to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we in the course the season still need perfecting, "Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have scored one or two more goals not yet. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes in the Paris team back, which is a 2 weekend: could hold 2 draws on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine winger was named the man of the PSG can take to the next level in Europe when he was acquired last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why, when he was running in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before passing beautifully finished to Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, which was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off hit to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine internationals in the field and was associated with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield lined up a tough opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic who passed away on Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG gave itself to sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not the least of Ibrahimovic, who slips up alone in the first half with no less than five attempts and was then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, the Di Maria turned in a shot on the turn, which was deflected past Wiland from 52 minutes to the post ...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season so after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank by Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">This ended all thought that Malmö could come back into play, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland blank range to stop David Luiz, could hold the final low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi goal was disallowed at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Åge Hareide, admitted later that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="1">Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins</seg>
<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Earlier they used to be one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played this role perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins wasted an opportunity for advancement within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild card place.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, even if only for an evening, there was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so hard to put on a lot of the second half of the season away.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support than Detroit three times scored in the first two innings, then again in the sixth and again in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) struck 6 times on the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish strong this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and therefore I will totally focused to go into the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated hitter Victor Martinez Tiger had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was the first three-hit game of Martinez, since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>

<seg id="16">He looked good in (batting practice), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it into play.</seg>
<seg id="17">With three runs in behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double to the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout, before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.</seg>

<seg id="25">Detroit benefited at the start of the game by a not moving Phil Hughes.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back injury.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Obviously not the start that I have liked," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I reciting and felt that I could do some pretty good pitches as in the third inning."</seg>
<seg id="28">After they got the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes fired a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.</seg>
<seg id="29">A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play which managed a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.</seg>
<seg id="30">Victor Martinez managed his success 0-21 series with runners in scoring position.</seg>
<seg id="31">The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right side, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game, as he was trying to get to the third, what the threat ended.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Tigers were up in the second, scored a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="33">"That was a big shock," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.</seg>
<seg id="34">He did not particularly well beaten, but he caught the right place.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.</seg>
<seg id="36">When Hughes led to three runs and six hits a walk with four strikeouts.</seg>
<seg id="37">NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez dropped out due to an injury of the throwing shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="38">He is examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in of 2007.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer Artist invested for three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the (gold) Crown of Thorns is one of the masterpieces that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus Alte Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not at Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now published with magnificent images.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes received the 75-year-old - but this is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics that may well look quite gloomy.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "book of all books".</seg>
<seg id="10">The result are cycles, dedicate themselves issues such crossroads, plagues, bids or the Our Father.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has spontaneously several partners intrigued: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler publisher with its emphasis on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there is especially the author Klaus Alte Post, which has dealt on the basis of the painting with the respective passages.</seg>
<seg id="13">He interprets the selected Otmar Alt scriptures and "translated" into today, in current relationships.</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are as verbal levels of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nestled them between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each one set of the artist who expresses his personal thoughts on the situation here.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewelry cover has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">So the 75-year-old allowed twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high degree of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Feelings were ultimately any trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Medal.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Since the education happened already with the cane," says Otmar Alt recalls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I've tried to work up to perhaps again to tolerate me with the Lord father".</seg>
<seg id="22">be His second concern, the art in fast-moving time to help back to more important: "The perception of imagery is today dominated by advertising, and is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is displaced there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have another delight and bliss, things to show.</seg>
<seg id="25">Images always have something mysterious and not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this regard, I'm a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants to let the viewer in the pictures "fall into it", they soak up, discover and sense the energy they have: "The picture looks for his opponent."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday during the presentation of Otmar-Alt-bible in Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "always" a lover of Otmar Alt to have been art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."</seg>
<seg id="29">Alt did not pay attention, the Bible fully grasp but selected are important to him, even mysterious subjects.</seg>
<seg id="30">"That was not cooperation on an equal footing," said Alte Post: "This is about the images, the text explains only". The result is a photo-Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Mohler from Luther-Verlag this is an invitation "to deepen his life and to find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alt's images speak for Mohler both the (biblical) language of love and the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - will be unveiled in an exhibition which will be opened in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung on 15 November.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of very great fashion show and a waxwork Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">They carry the spectacular creations of French designer, which has been used with Madonna's stage outfits to big star of the fashion scene - and the fact that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say that I am, the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Earlier it was bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen on 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the couturier its initially dismissive attitude has changed to a show about his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually, he was against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When you die, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had previously done this in Montreal and in Paris station.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen said.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the barely over-looking work of the man, the fashion history wrote, without ever having received training.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the exhibition is not built up, but it is a perfectly choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk, for much effort has been made: to comb the dolls, specially a stylist for example, was committed.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons of material have carted according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich the makers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest a special treat was still in the process: a leather pants outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He had always been interested in strong women ( "women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Gaultier old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It represents the first, tentative fashionable baby steps of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had his teddy dressed bras and dresses, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing with a puppet, his parents would not allow him.</seg>
<seg id="23">Designing fashion he had later taught himself.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and looked at the other designers such as Gaultier told in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later I then but of course bought.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first fashion show he had the models can not pay.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewelry instead curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">Previously it was the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen about making meters.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and laces created in large quantity for customers who, for example, further processed into blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">That alone does not work today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Fashion lace Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of Plauen lace fashion played a greater role, was then supplanted by the home textiles industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt gives some examples: peak in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ever forms the so-called vintage fashion, inspired by past eras, an increasing order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone using any niche in the textile industry in Germany, is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">We already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen together with nine other companies member of the industry association Plauen lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they may bear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales are broken.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private shops and wholesalers, there are almost no more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customer in this way any more.</seg>
<seg id="16">The commodity being manufactured much cheaper nowadays in Asia and sold almost exclusively via chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Moreover schwächle Export, currently in Russia and in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Ample reasons for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association tries to score points by environmental awareness, as explained Cordula Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein: "This year we are introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ecologically and socially compatible".</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at Schneeberger branch of Zwickau University - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">To counter the competition from Asian something, you need to find quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">This takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">This creates a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and the companies who have to think economically, especially, "says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some years ago a busy textile designer Kati Reuter historical snowball top new.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine embroiders small balls in some places.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plauener goldsmith Bianca Hallenbach-Krauße was inspired them: "Before I could with traditional Plauener Spitze do anything".</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region identify with the theme Plauen lace - young and old," said Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also provides in the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a keepsake.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of Plauen lace.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predatory fish and expect consumers so that a significantly higher dose of nerve agent.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organization Food Watch, which there is a corresponding one of the EU working paper, the plans sharply criticized: "risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy are passed on in full force to pregnant women and infants," explained Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wolf Schmidt to the limits of the nerve agent for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish from "economic reasons" be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">Large predators are but already so contaminated with mercury that about 50 percent of the catch can not be sold on the basis of currently applicable limits.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the thresholds then only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return for this easing the EU wants to tighten the limits for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram, according to Food Watch.</seg>
<seg id="8">Foodwatch but called it a "trick" because smaller predatory fish, such as carp usually charged so low that they comply with the proposed maximum values already.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in young fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion that helps the economy alone," said Wolf Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal to humans, which concentrates heavily on the food chain, especially in predatory fish.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government warns that can "even small amounts especially in unborn damage to the nervous system" cause.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Environment Ministry said on its website with regard to the maximum levels applicable but that a "health risk in the general population" could not be expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury passes mainly through the combustion of coal in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German coal-fired plants, according to a written inquiry from the Federal Environment Ministry to the Greens parliamentarian Annalena Baerbock more than six tonnes of mercury a year from two-thirds of the radiation emitted in Germany total.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish as in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and exceeded coverage", the "mirror" was quoted in March from the paper.</seg>
