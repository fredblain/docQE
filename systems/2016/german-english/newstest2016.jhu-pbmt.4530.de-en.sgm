<seg id="1">In an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend, and that officials would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb, it was important to point out that his "sweet dog" but still live and likely to be excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was gekritzelt on a white block: "I am so tired of doing it, I wanted to, I could make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, was already 300 miles went to the school grounds, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office was shot and killed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10: 18 p.m. have heard.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb committed suicide as the police einkesselte him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shootout at the university, which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators at both ends of the state published details, as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they were happy to his teaching.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him, in which he referred to the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">They both taught in the department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb the Delta State University, had previously asked for a leave for health reasons, and said that he had a health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">The latest changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion of the lamb had worked so hard for him, no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, "there was something in Mr Lambs idea."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that can no longer answer lamb.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus, the police found later Lambs lane when he scored again in Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested lamb killed, selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.</seg>

<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>

<seg id="34">All the girls melted away when he was there, "said hair tone, now 40, and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In an emergency, Lamb said, "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who was with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was fine.</seg>
<seg id="39">The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O 'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends and had a daughter, who is now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O "Steen said of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Steen said he had never met lamb, but by using his daughter, he heard that lamb was interested in music and blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb hit Prentiss, when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played a gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Steen said that his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he and Prentiss, Lamb Night in the night of September 5, the last time I saw after Lamb, his guitar and harmonica play stopped in front of a sparse crowd had ended.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no signs that anything was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were laughing and joking with each other on the up.</seg>
<seg id="51">I think they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>

<seg id="62">Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have never married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is serious.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the upper echelons of surveys downwards, it has not worked yet ().</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump in double digits, and some start seriously to ask what the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership, given to the rising Herman Cain, none of which also won only one state in the nominating process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers that indicate that the real estate mogul, is not just a temporary phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, showed a survey of Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul positively.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the middle of July, there were 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these figures are in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week, has found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two thirds of the GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, the candidate said.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans see Trump's temperament is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump widely for his bombastic and insulting statements will be criticised, 52 percent of Republicans negligible Irish voters that the real estate mogul and the right temperament for a president, as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, 44 percent, that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they put their scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week, four out of ten, that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July, put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past, not the clearest crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination would only 28% compared to the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, it appears that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign as a plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans had a different candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump support to more than a dozen other candidates diffuse is distributed.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll by Monmouth University at the beginning of September, shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has a 13 point lead over Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio, 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie, 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson was the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race overtake.</seg>
<seg id="46">A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have lent their voices.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment, the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have made up their minds, are twice as likely for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican Party will keep and which will damage Neuorientierungs's efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that with Trump on issues of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, as long as the immigration remains in the spotlight, it will also do seem to Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">The frustration with the government climbs to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">On Donald Trump and Ben Carson now accounts for around half of the support of Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday's ABC / Post, they want a political outsider, rather than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa-Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, dissatisfied with 54 percent, "" and 21 percent "the angry."</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP,</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private arbitration facilities for disputes between corporations and states, therefore, are to be replaced by a more transparent system that meets its operation significantly more traditional dishes.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to set up a system to which the public trust," said the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">TTIP through the world's largest free trade zone is to emerge with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans for reform of the current arbitration can see clearly that the EU countries and the United States jointly independent judges to select a new investment tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="9">You have to come in equal parts from the EU, the United States and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also a second instance for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow it to appeal against judgments.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the procedure agreed among themselves to referee, an appeal against their sentences, there was not.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the debate over the past few months, it is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, not trusted, Malmström commented.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, she wants to work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.</seg>
<seg id="16">Especially those of large corporations demanded Investor State Arbitration (ISDS) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbitrators are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system, the companies can wrest compensation at the expense of the taxpayer to circumvent national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first statements described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact, the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="19">The criticism that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).</seg>
<seg id="20">The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission needs to reform key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitration is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French government welcomed the plans by Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">Particularly small and medium sized businesses could be disadvantaged by it.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Negotiations are under way since the middle of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally a framework should be for the agreement at the end of this year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (sits today: Luxor).</seg>
<seg id="3">Next to him is a flip chart on which the timid acting folk singers the US state of Michigan has recorded with a felt pen.</seg>

<seg id="5">He tells from different places, which he repeatedly einzeichnet on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where they are, and how it looks in his home country.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since then, Stevens turns out to be a wonderful creative madman.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the third album, released in 2003, and "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties snuggle, but always drifting into the great opulent seem wise.</seg>
<seg id="9">There is a rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of an audacious series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.</seg>

<seg id="25">We hear from the audience: The lecture was "abundant" and thus you can basically throw away the "plate."</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with tension</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time and for the first time with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will rise up to the first of his six set points shortly after noon, with his performance probably by the media and the Labour MEPs from the subject.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also said that he might skip a few sessions to leave to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet, and after his speech at the Tuc-annual meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence, criticism from a number of Tory most provoked and is at the heart of several front page stories in newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he has acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had come to the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused, Mr Corbyns top team to serve, and they refer to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin 1988 says that political differences within Labour "stack" after Mr Corbyn's remarks on the position of the European Union, and the reduction in profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour amendments to present to the whole idea of a limit as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that she only against the government's plans, the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, the Tory leader, since he is in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House, opposite.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has more than 30,000 comments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too konfrontativ, and that he is "both repartee and refrain from arguing with the barbs and instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will represent him, if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also brought to the idea that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he had referred to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he is from the policy in the style of a "theatre" to remove polls, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as a key barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons, and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and in need of reform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash Bodenständigkeits launches campaign to combat Aldi- invasion</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash tried to the IGA stores in front of an Aldi-gathering in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash Bodenständigkeits has launched a campaign to get the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia on the eve of a $700 million to defend Aldi's invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi opening two distribution centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, is preparing to strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets, its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as events such as Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Duns borough, which distributes samples in IGA stores and shopkeepers, cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League sell to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy, published on 29 September, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and sets its annual Investor Strategietag.</seg>
<seg id="7">Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia, nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops make up and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi twelve months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players, but mainly independent retailers will take away sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">A report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath estimated by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016, could lose.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year, 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcash Metcashs high fixed costs around $13 million could profit before interest and taxes cost, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly in Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA purchasers are the most faithful.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund manager today Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade, Metcash.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But there is an assumption that a member of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS market share since 2010, from 18 percent to 14 percent, and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200-IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, while the operational deleveraging pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler refuses and is investing more than $150 million to date with Coles and sale prices on hundreds of products every week level and IGA retailers to improve their stores by improving faster growing fresh food and a better selection of private-label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years, will return to profit growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks," came the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had to Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee, where Harrison stated: "Beat Wawrinka had Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racquet, after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group foiled, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard an artist's in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing that I really ereifere me is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has broken a racket, because of a Krampfes lost in the US Open, but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he was in the U.S. Open extremely well, even among the somewhat provocative circumstances, with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I think he was a little too strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never been a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good form, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios in the major preliminary decision, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra, as part of a long term return to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not" to all the controversy around [Kyrgios], Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, it is in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he deserves, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and found that those who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim of halting the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos ensued at the border, when hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints of countries and built tents and settled there.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations grew.</seg>
<seg id="6">When a police helicopter was hovering above them, the migrants chanted "Open the borders!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some were in protest food and water.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were returned, while more and more out of Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels failed to agree on a common immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge, they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, would resume.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Tuesday, the state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could absperren roads and speeding up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race, the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, were used.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the arriving economic migrants who are in search of a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that contrasts starkly with other EU states, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of 4 meters (13 feet) high fence, which the government along the southern border with Serbia, wisely, a crime, these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament must still technically still agree with the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but by Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser for Orban, said that authorities 45 people to attempt to cross the border was arrested, 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">You come across as they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and commit crimes are accused under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians, a small office in a metal container opened to edit the data of people and a lot of people put up there hineinzudrängen.</seg>
<seg id="29">Around 20 could get it, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in a national poll halved</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent, while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll has Clinton on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have narrowed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton, however, still has a large lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support them, because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited by it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters who say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say that about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want it to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Clinton's supporters, their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility will also be cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If the primaries democratic voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice, Biden is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, by 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden, a second is by far in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about the eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics of voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, Clinton's strength is in the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, more than twice as many say that Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters in the primaries, Clinton, Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, continue to be made, most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion on this issue was in March, shortly after the problem came to light, divided.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the email controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her has worsened.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them, as a whole, among registered voters: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of voters do not think it is an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationally to see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are doing best in honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority believes Sanders more than honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood, with the death of a Baruch College newcomer charged</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, brutal and delayed his journey to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand has been charged, and has been attacked repeatedly, while he tried to have a frozen field on an objective approach.</seg>
<seg id="5">Finally, Mr. Deng complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, they had the time to switch Deng's clothes to Google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and the welfare of the Brotherhood were basically over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thigh.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970 in the harassment," said Douglas Fier, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Monroe County grand jury recommended a third degree charges of murder for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Zweiunddreißig members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to make not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership of the local group.</seg>

<seg id="1">That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike is coming, and the boom is flagging, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know how long it takes and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the story offers little guidance for the economy in the end.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, representatives of the US central bank so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when to start raising interest rates, but rather on the period that is needed for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants could see that the whole excitement has been exaggerated, possibly due to a rise in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," Julian Jessop, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at very low levels, to the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">That does not mean that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not as dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a trend that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be strangled, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is usually in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat over the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle, and thus increase the yield begins to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote raising interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is very noteworthy that GDP is close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank's nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent, only a few that will last and are waiting for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Participants throughout the year to a rate hike by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that an increase in the FOMC could approve this session, the futures trading is only a probability of 25%.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study have all increased cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows asked," according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are now 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was also volatile, because the market is anticipating a rate hike, and similar to the pattern rather than on the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks, if they change their strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">With bond yields seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">By Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, European fixed income at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already on the Fed's policy and expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large companies that do most of their business in the US, will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and the financing of its debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "stocks tend, three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets for each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with low quality (by an average of 4 percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt will be a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts are divided on how quickly it will take place.</seg>

<seg id="7">The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly no longer to distinguish from its commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems - I use the word" verdummen "does not like - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The bathrooms smelt only under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only "imitate what is already on the market, said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC Director General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learn from Radio 3, which I will learn about classical music anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and new works, I think it is really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of this year, Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience argued the BBC than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture, media and sport, came under fire for its commercial rivals to the feet.</seg>

<seg id="4">Online sales intensified three years ago, through the use of mobile phones to shop</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the spending has slowed the Black Friday in November</seg>
<seg id="6">For more than a decade, the virtual shopping geboomt, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.</seg>

<seg id="8">The total spending for August showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only five percent increase over the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say that there are signs that online sales stagnate after new figures, only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 indicated</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the growth rate for the previous years and go back to 2000, then it has developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that the online sales increased to three years ago, when buyers started to make purchases with their mobile phones.</seg>

<seg id="10">Véronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, the DIY chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering the services at budget prices is now obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix shops for artisans and to close 60 B & Q stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mrs Laury said she wanted more women in B & Q stores, because eight out of ten purchasing decisions are made by women in the shop.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the moment, the men predominate among employees.</seg>
<seg id="14">She said it was necessary to make the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mrs Laury said: "There is still a majority of men in our stores.</seg>
<seg id="16">We need to move it more towards a balance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Basically, the half of our customers are women, with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.</seg>
<seg id="18">Women play a major role in the decision making.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of one of Britain's leading companies listed in the FTSE100 index is also has its top team umstruktiert, an equal number of men and women in leadership positions to reflect.</seg>
<seg id="20">Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women, including its CEO and CFO.</seg>
<seg id="21">Mrs Laury said: "This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue.</seg>
<seg id="22">It was not difficult to find good women to our board.</seg>
<seg id="23">Kingfisher announced a drop in half year profit and sales after the group schulterte the cost of closing the stores.</seg>
<seg id="24">Because of the trend is Kingfisher, which owns B & Q and northern, 200 new stores.</seg>

<seg id="12">The Verwurf of infidelity, the defense stated that a fortune to be part of the club at any time.</seg>
<seg id="13">Sports officials would only offset expenses and for the sports club, they have been operating from 1982 to 2011, and in which they have invested a lot of time and money, brought out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 amounted to approximately 600,000 Schilling (approximately 44,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="14">"At that time, we were faced with the situation: We run the club or we lock too?," one of the defendants in the bread work great auditor told the Financial District.</seg>

<seg id="32">The Mitangeklagte had been informed, justified the official.</seg>
<seg id="33">This transfer was formulated as "damage reparation."</seg>
<seg id="34">Why Schadensgutmachung?, judge and prosecutor wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first defendant stated that he had been dissatisfied with this wording, because the damage is never outside the club.</seg>
<seg id="36">But what should I do if the lawyer says: "With all of you are off the hook."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I am a legal representative?" He asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Furthermore, the official said he had never taken a penny of salary, for he had just kilometres of money and diets.</seg>

<seg id="1">The decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">The world watched when the US Federal Reserve in two days on Wednesday and Thursday, comes together to make the important decision to make, whether for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rates will be raised or not.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half that only last week was of the opinion that the Fed will do so, now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start," said Angel Ubide, Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Fed can ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision is expected at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced</seg>

<seg id="1">Shooter at the Delta State University left a letter of apology</seg>
<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day, before he wrote his colleagues shot and killed Shannon Lamb - a note to say that he "fed up" with the first murder and he wanted to know "can make it reversed," authorities said on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning, calling upon</seg>
<seg id="4">And said he had shot and killed someone to someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb said the employee of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" in the house, but no one is "upset," but probably will be excited.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police asked the caller to his name, but he was not him.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, said: "I am so sorry, I wish I could undo it.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police umzingelten him.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but, of course, "there was something in Mr Lambs idea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports on Monday that Lamb reportedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information" no evidence for a "triangular relationship."</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss was described by Shawn O 'Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years, as a "good man."</seg>
<seg id="15">The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was" devastated. "</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that her daughter had Prentiss "absolute best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss worked online from home, according to testimony by Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning met, for about three years with lamb.</seg>
<seg id="20">"They always wanted to help other people," said Knowles</seg>
<seg id="21">The police said that lamb phoned relatives at one point on Monday to tell them, "he will not go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When police heard him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb was in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University with a doctorate, as Lau tells his life on the website of the university.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat by Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg.</seg>
<seg id="3">While this brought the left side defenders cry and it will be ruled out for at least six months from the game, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="4">The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20 year old Shaw in the PSV area had collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was dealt with nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="6">Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="7">He will be published tomorrow, or perhaps a day later, and then operates in Manchester.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very difficult and then great, and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wept.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope that he can play again this season.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters.</seg>

<seg id="17">It was a very serious attack with both feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages, words can't describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."</seg>

<seg id="22">If a player leaves with this type of injury, are all very sad about it.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team played at the World Cup in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then when you hear that it is a very serious violation, it is not good," Cocu said.</seg>
<seg id="26">For me, it was not possible to see the moment.</seg>
<seg id="27">The only thing I could see the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.</seg>

<seg id="5">It is a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "It was funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."</seg>
<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, but a summary of the film version of 2012 reflects the new characters and details added to the relatively short text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one, a love interest was Dr. /, whose real name was Theodor / hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron sometimes reads like the summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website will be presented and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams of winning."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little known, hears a unbenannter boy, as the local environment through the avaricious, trees cases, knitting Thneed Once-ler, despite the protests of the named Lorax, Hock, schnurrbärtigen, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," will be devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, The Lorax 20 times in a row is not a child read.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text of Cameron's constituency office is likely to come.</seg>
<seg id="12">Super Camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but had no further immediate comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult</seg>
<seg id="2">On Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat and not on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out a victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side is probably less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin-player in the Batting-list, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a youthful positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England's Test squad and will be replaced by Alex champions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave out Adam Lyth, of course, is to analyze me as his head coach in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that this led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.</seg>
<seg id="10">A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he is not so good services, and it does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test shot man gets to his character, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven chances - such as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compton was only got the chance to play home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only criticism I can make is that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan routine when Lyth in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex champions comes in, and he is a hit man, whom I have high.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X Factor cricketers what we saw Yorkshire early this season, when he 236 against us on the Trent Bridge pitch achieved what hit us.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but of course it depends on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook, with an extra-spin Bowler provide and would receive four Quicks, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a man can't go there, and that Hendrix has already shown that he is a devil guy of cricket players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is a big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has made three hundred runs immediately and never looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has really impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour, and brings energy and a strong commitment to the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he was for the international cricket competition is created, as a player or as a coach, and how he has Mahela insights that we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not with a light heart.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could rise to win when the economy by the year 2017 gets into a slump</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's crude Neuverhandlungs strategy to keep Britain in the EU, with each day deeper into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn as leader of Labour or the Tuc who are falling sharply due to Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, it is now time, and not always from their own guilt, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they often do not want to be satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when they threaten the social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also have Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend who is an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent wishes - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals has come to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's carefully measured Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been 10 years in power, and the office wants to leave before it looks bad for them, as ausharrenden like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16 is the excessively long).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a declining force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain is a left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will get a leg bent to help the Selfie-British, whose energy should be used more, Scotland's exit from the UK to prevent - something they may not want to, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore, possibly even planning some kind of ministers deliberately unhelpful comments, the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Britain has won nothing of value out of the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics, the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn were not, however, that our entry in 1973, with a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can be weak to Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunists, who has a reputation as a "straight" EU banana Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s, it has made.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included a medley of tax for fearing the rogue, phone hack of foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tony Blair actually thought much about it, but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distributes bananas to distract him, rather than being on his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened the door for him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never forgiven him for that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me on Monday in Westminster, a friendly pat on the back, I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch 80's strategy to repeat a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may be, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew moroccan, whose BBC-sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyns official position on Europe - I express it nicely - in the development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wilder climes of Tories Klein Engländerismus everyone can say 'yes' to do so.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is to admit what Hilary Benn said, "A, but not a Bennite" Benn on radio and on television this week, when the Scout fought in it, not that provocative Corbyns appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father tried to do on television, disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and losing his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilarys fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But struggling to remain "under any circumstances" - Benns - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his colleagues and MPs after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the consists bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even moved me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right to give Cameron a free ticket for Europe, which allows him to Labour's support in the referendum campaign as a matter of course, as McDonnell, it said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Certainly Simon Jenkins thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with the Bennite Belagerungs economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small differences, a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why Paris or Berlin should waste political capital - they have also distrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if anything can be so pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already pretty disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory government in power, which I start on Monday was reminded of something that is called British Influence Security Forum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegations of a publicly funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by the Public Health England (PHE) in her report on e-cigarettes used evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data, and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE its main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "on stone or sand build."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to a model of a multiple criteria and decision analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Cape, said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, the managing director of British American Tobacco to previously means (BAT) to obtain an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette-maker, but not the funding, according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received, she added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but there are several popular e-cigarette champions, some of which is also an industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting, also took the tobacco by PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of hard evidence, the damage of most products on most criteria, "said McKee and Cape.</seg>
<seg id="18">But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Cape, said that the allegations of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or serve smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that it has responded to the allegations by BMJ earlier.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still have to study the long term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">The clear submission of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage that will be caused by smoking, and we meet our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">The BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that no other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, solid window against the most popular shows of their rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do, Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 have tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts, which also clearly not subsidized rivals would be shown," said Johnson, the House of Lords communications committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others are doing or not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show, this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course, it is nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funding programs that could be financed without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a programme, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both own productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for.</seg>
<seg id="13">I try to see how this is supposed to be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular shows are what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, and in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public service niche programs "to BBC4 should go where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue when their hypocritical missions to justify a £4 billion broadcasting fees go," Well, of course, we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">Put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from that.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, they all think we all think that for £150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who have the £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true wonder, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said very little about the BBC production would now officially classified as an education - he said that 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be on the public television stations in Australia and Canada, take an example that change to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of partnerships Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">"Sono Genetics' can control brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that are too high for human hearing frequencies to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">More on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the birth Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures that TRP-4 ion channels are called and in the cell membranes of some of the worms are found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned to, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to create ultrasonic controlled nematodes, genetically modified Chalasani the worms in such a way that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the micro vesicles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the revised motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low frequency ultrasonic waves can freely pass through tissue and into the brain from the top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could be to muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="9">Related: DSEi Arms Fair: Authoritarian regimes flock to London</seg>
<seg id="10">But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of posters at bus stops and metro-trains to see and which require a second look.</seg>

<seg id="12">In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.</seg>
<seg id="13">The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Dismaland Banksys.</seg>
<seg id="14">A group called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 -Pack of Inbusschlüsseln, claiming that "access to around a third of bus stops and advertising space on the planet gain."</seg>
<seg id="15">Transport for London is the Plaka animal "vandalism" not funny.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the parody ads, which was produced by Special Patrol Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work for the audience outside of galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">Many artists make themselves with activists in protest movements to work and say that they have to go out into the real world, so that their art has an impact on society.</seg>
<seg id="19">Another of the anti-arms-posters greets the commuters in the subway.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was surprised at the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."</seg>
<seg id="22">They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy firms advertising, but "by the einbläuen with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."</seg>
<seg id="23">"They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices to raise at the show," says Tom Davies, of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal.</seg>

<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many students residences form a room-to-room-pedestrian culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">This can be a hell for someone who is trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I love you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away, so I get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you."</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and low earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I show how you still can build cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms have no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the people are, to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In light of the refugee flow, we also need enough housing over the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs at least.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is different when you are under the people in residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Took six months of construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">The building regulations have complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: Building, I have learned through my project.</seg>
<seg id="27">Particularly complicated, it is always the impending special sword of Damocles and pitch regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Still, it is assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house with three apartments, needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities of the place is missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents responded to their terraced house project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: It is true that we have had over the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project is the message, the ordinary people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I'll show how you can still build cheap and good.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what it is all about.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.</seg>

<seg id="4">Some are encountered after the installation of problems, because they receive an error message that says that "software update failed."</seg>

<seg id="6">The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.</seg>
<seg id="7">That may mean the deletion of apps to make room, but Apple has made it less likely by the streamlining of the update, and it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then install them again once the process is complete.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is worthwhile to ensure that your phone is charged during the upgrade, or is located near a battery charger, so that the battery is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="9">If the charge is too low, Apple does not mean that the update will continue because the phone could possibly halfway switches off and lead to a breakdown of the update.</seg>

<seg id="25">On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The occupants were all night, around 500 kilometres away from the Macedonian border with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police told us that we are supposed to go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">Thus, it might actually have already predicted by observers to postpone the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary at a nearby stretch a little further west.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control."</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's Interior Minister project had previously stressed that his country had prepared in the event of a large influx of refugees corresponding plans for possible emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">He gave no details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member "comprehensive opportunities for border control.</seg>
<seg id="33">We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia is part of that, since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serb side, about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg continue to remain completely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos: He thought the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="41">It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Migrant workers - dangerous - alternative routes rates</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless, however: In parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia is still not cleared minefields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region.</seg>

<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and Liefer giant lowered its profit outlook for the full year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to about 55,000 seasonal workers hired for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in Premarket trading about 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts were expecting, according to a survey by FactSet 10,84 $.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effectively on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it expects, however, that the result compared to the previous year, due to lower costs, higher revenues and because of the growth in online trading will increase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, if one takes the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade, into account."</seg>
<seg id="11">The plans for the holidays and employment were a day later than those of rival UPS announced that plans to 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, which predicted twelve analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12,23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has in recent years, a decline in international priority shipment, the sales in its unity express delivery to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 percent in the ground transportation, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and even insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result due to higher labour costs in the freight business.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot-Honduras mahogany table, to decide whether it is time for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Loom above them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And the third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them, it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 to be weaned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets, the already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rates on federal bonds to increase - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they" observe, Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty to wait around the global market enough justification to continue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what confuses itself in the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg, have predicted a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the financial markets are expecting the Fed wait, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rates, unless the strategists would soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates would be at this stage, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it does, "they would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had in the spring and early summer, said that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation persistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world zuckten at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its record high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered slightly this month, while the Dow is now down by almost 10% below the high in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">Representatives for the Fed's influence the market turbulence, the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so technically it should not be involved in their decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere mention of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could narrow their monetary expansion, "" triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, from the Fed's representatives can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks and expert advice to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision is "more art than science," Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy, said of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that the Fed "a history of overreaction on financial market movements that do not seem to with the economic fundamentals are linked."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the Fed's representatives made these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should only be aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008 first, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee, said the interest rate set by the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"They will certainly not get into the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are" understandably upset, Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think that they should jump ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="7">With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many cities.</seg>
<seg id="8">They compete with low-income citizens the last affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="9">To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a study commissioned by the Alliance "social housing associations comes."</seg>
<seg id="11">By comparison, this year 260,000 units will be finished in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">With 140,000 homes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Refugees are required for the first three months of their stay, no longer to live as asylum seekers in a reception.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many come to the housing market and a fall in the long queues in front of the apartments.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the German Federal Statistical Office states, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year, however, for rent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only in the increasing numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany play a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, around 770.000 units were missing in the urban areas, Matthias Günther, author of the study laments.</seg>

<seg id="21">Young adults were due to the slowdown in the housing market involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama."</seg>
<seg id="22">In the cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined in recent years, for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="23">To solve the problem, the alliance "social housing" proposes a fresh start.</seg>
<seg id="24">However, new incentives to boost social housing.</seg>
<seg id="25">It could be dispensed with the estate tax and property taxes for subsidised housing will be temporarily suspended.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, an attractive tax relief are necessary, according to the alliance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The funding programme for refugee housing, the state bank KfW is already in towns and cities.</seg>
<seg id="28">A week after the launch, more than half of the available around 300 million euros was on Monday evening, with 184 million euros has already been retrieved.</seg>

<seg id="9">Some of the 1200 inhabitants and is about dozens of corners is related to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel shot a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think that somehow it is exciting, but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply," says Simone Wendel.</seg>

<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of an "illegal Auswanderers."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had repeatedly spoken contemptuously about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Like the poltert, this is not so good," says Hans Bender, a distant cousin Trump ("The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").</seg>

<seg id="29">Does he believe that Trump is coming?</seg>

<seg id="32">Guesthouse owner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter mentions that a descendant of the family donated Heinz during a visit to the church organ, which was generally good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I can not imagine me from the Donald," says the 68-year old.</seg>
<seg id="34">You think it would be better for him if the election because "have such radical views, I do not know if this is a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="35">When those who were at the time of his grandfather in the United States, calling the shots, it would have been like him, "he would never even got there."</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are" more interesting topics than him, vintner's daughter Sarah Bühler says.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as the president?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My president is" it is not, she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: "The grapes are ripe, even without the President Trump."</seg>

<seg id="3">Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly apparently who wins The Bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="4">The woman, Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally lands, was shrouded in utmost secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="5">And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the final rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">But when we are with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows in the day before, two out of three are eincheckten, you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sam Wood is keeping his lips sealed until the final on Thursday</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women have ruminated on lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man and called for his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive Woods final rose?" Their answers could be a spoiler who won the heart of the Bachelor.</seg>
<seg id="10">Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had from the first day of a simple relationship with each other.</seg>

<seg id="14">I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.</seg>
<seg id="15">You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.</seg>
<seg id="16">Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple would be suitable.</seg>
<seg id="17">From their point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood "A" could be.</seg>
<seg id="18">"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully focused on him," she said.</seg>
<seg id="19">And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if they do not, because it was puzzling.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study may take at least five years.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data takes a long time for something to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient, but most of the studies were carried out by people who pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers used from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007, they have gained in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who embarked on this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who undergo surgery, at 36% of the diabetes-disease completely and partially at 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medical treatment group was full of diabetes compared to only one percent and partly in only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results were in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this "better" tooth control - as you are in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - do not reflect reduced mortality in five years, according to the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie Group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete removal of the diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was in the Swedish study of obese people who undergo a Adipositas operation, about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients showed, Blackstone said, it should be reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously, as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the violence in the home countries of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compas Ion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics.</seg>
<seg id="5">He demanded that the interests of humanity should be put under the circumstances before the interests of individual nations or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised in Germany and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Managing several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">We need to reduce the use of force.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and George Bush's actions commented after the terrorist attack on September 11, and it became clear that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.</seg>
<seg id="14">After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.</seg>

<seg id="19">Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had gotten his head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary, Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It would be fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use soft products or disinfecting wipes and hand disinfectants should be stored beyond the reach of the child.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why do I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will be put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">When it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was back in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approached, I began to fear me.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applicants than places available, a macabre lottery will take place to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is selected, who will observe it dispassionately.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist, so it will not be possible for me, a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she had "put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong to what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He tells me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter is here to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement against the death penalty will help.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, you should hear a series of podcasts, which I have made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to go back on all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective, I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters to whom you can go for it.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the race, and he himself had found under difficult conditions, when it comes to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris was that he could not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had 18 months because of the espionage accusations withheld and did not want it "look like grapes hanging too high."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I was going to say nothing, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once, Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You know that it went.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I want to walk with my head held high, and I want my owners think I try my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">When they start to think that I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then I have to think about what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with racing.com walk that the Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables," Moody said of Racing.</seg>
<seg id="15">They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is the case, they should certainly look to their noses because they have failed in an attempt to keep it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time, and it still is.</seg>
<seg id="18">That should bring me to the view that it will be personally?</seg>
<seg id="19">The RVL has behaved cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps the people out there think that I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they need to give me my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say, think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">It makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I am going to put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The frustrations levels of the trainer, with the protracted cobalt on Lidari's investigation, and the late scratching meant that he said that he "his license could throw on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten Black Caviar Master, described the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied, which breached against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been so last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It would have been all day yesterday, which was true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it also had it on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody with a three month disqualification to be confronted with the treatment of the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need rules, but here they have gone too far," said Moody.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne-Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes against rivals due to allegations of ring fight back</seg>
<seg id="2">The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has been criticism of the tack of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees "ring the Storm players fighting" with his team during the high storm's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team won the finals against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had achieved. He called the game a "prime example" of the Rugby League, and said that the two from Queensland "not too well" in the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack, on their "Contact."</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team confidently agree with him, because it means that they are concerned, the Storm team to be beaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It comes up again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling matches than they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or techniques, but we have made over the last six weeks, our contact in football makes a real focus, and that has brought us to the turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there for three years, and he is obviously losing a great team to train, and he is therefore probably not since, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this appears again at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy Bennetts idea attacked by the "exciting football" and his mentor recalls that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought to us when it came to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game 20: 18, there are two further attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or breaks are no points and make something interesting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it is the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">When they talk to us, it means that we will be taking in a stage for them.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale. The ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create it."</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What is in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to Germany this year, according to the Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD, Germany is even able to include a million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do it."</seg>
<seg id="6">What is in store for Germany, gives the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to various estimates are needed between 350000 (estimate by the German Federal Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) homes a year - and the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is almost twice as much as previously (250000 homes will be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically, however, is the lack of housing, especially affordable rental properties: A year falling out 60,000 to 80000 social housing from the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments will also apply for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double the funding, currently 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to occur every year, and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists agree and federal construction minister is that it also needs to give more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates from the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of the workforce in the long term can be disciplined in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, to help them start, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, whether they can find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also the self esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, there has been a political shift, according to Thränhardt: From the work ban for refugees on the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was a ban on asylum seekers in the past five years, it has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company has the vision - also because of the resources - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far, there is a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt according to the royal road to integration work.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration found that only a few station parents give their children to the care centres, it is estimated that 10 to 15 percent, "for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, in order to convince the family from the benefits of Kita, the administration hand slip distributed in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">The need for educators were to rise due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In countries without the knowledge of German students in Welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="28">But they are not always informed by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration says.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception in Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has been abandoned, but now his attitude.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permits or tolerance do not receive benefits under the current law, asylum seekers more if they begin a study.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter are basically not Bafög because they do not fall into the circle of people entitled to BAföG.</seg>
<seg id="35">So far Belgium refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be eligible Bafög-, from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">But even this funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen crash, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.</seg>
<seg id="37">The students should immediately get Bafög.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play an important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslim, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">Islam, the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion ratio.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who cares professionally for the new arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="41">On the rights and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="42">As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas, and to give him some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "immediately to their right, here," in Germany, forfeited, he said in the Bavarian broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration in the future will be much more than it is now a topic of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="48">The majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination and a general equality law.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the series showed the spirits of murder, the police and the authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrants organizations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and commit what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention, Germany, has to be a reality in the next few years, if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany would be able to provide the expected refugees medically, doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="53">"As far as a power and capacity, we create it," he told the Daily Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, this extra money to flow into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery wants to hand over all arrivals on the registration health cards.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services could be charged later with the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="57">And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to toss as many people with limited service catalog, which stipulated the current law on asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, the doctors are especially the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in hospitals, including medical practices would have to be taken on interpreting costs, she says.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic view.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, for example, there are far more unprocessed disability, and young people go to HIV education.</seg>
<seg id="64">With some of the other diseases, German doctors would come from their education, but clearly, Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the shortage of doctors, even relief may be in sight for the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be able to practice, but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapy (BPtK) mentally ill: Most suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from "flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, palpitation and Todesängsten.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms of sleep and concentration disorders, strong shock and emotional deafness.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent the chronic symptoms would be an early treatment, Munz said.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can make a request for a psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses were mostly in the social services, to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.</seg>

<seg id="2">Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down at the beginning of the year, from a podium on the staircase.</seg>
<seg id="3">He was unhurt, but the video of the event quickly spread on social media.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack to have a look</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to look that it is only September and if his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario is that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then back to his old swing had found during the low season.</seg>
<seg id="5">This kind of "at risk of injury is not the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that has not healed well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in connection with his ankles, or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but also, as Wenger acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also develops an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of look since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, one of the two Premier League clubs who have suffered the most damage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilises, I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the kind that he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and" the players who need to take a little breather, Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the biggest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is unrivalled after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal, the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope, with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am in the business long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends: The comedy show that we are serious lessons about male friendship grants</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of challenging the culture in question, rivalling the men to seek help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood" had his chances of recovery are doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, half a circle of mentally healthy friends, the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of social media's communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives are lively, strong, and to be successful, doubled, even though, in reality, dominates the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health is much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="12">And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money can buy happiness, not really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was not defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and his frequent hugs, moments when football peering in comfortable armchairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to, in any case, even if they are often withhold to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide, has really made me see how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us, often do not feel able to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I come in," has a huge impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">So my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair may also help, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so when you visit this weekend with the Comedy Central) festival to celebrate the day, completely redesigned scenery, why don't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you sit in Starbucks to see someone alone, you give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friends fixed</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria is making his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to cross in Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here is the match report and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute, a Kopfballtor.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, because it is not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a great game by Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with whom he made his illustrious career began back in 1999, changed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to look back, 2: 0 to win, and to cause problems to our opponents, even if there are certain things that we still" in the course of the season to perfection, Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet made one or two more goals. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Beckham, who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend with a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the league could hold, but he was in the fourth minute trumped by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month has been taken over by Manchester United, and he suggested that when he turned in Marco Erzähler pass behind the defence ran into Malmö University, before he passed to Johan Wiland nicely into the corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage, came to national Anpiff with nine players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield strung a serious opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away in Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG gave themselves sometimes, with some false passports and poor qualifications, not least from Inter, who was went on no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game and it was a pass from Inter, Di Maria turned into a spin shot by Wiland in the 52nd minute was diverted past the post.</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic a left flank of Maxwell had been exploited.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could be low, before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later announced that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifying games are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="2">MINNEAPOLIS--Die second half of the season for the Detroit Tigers was not particularly funny.</seg>
<seg id="3">Previously, they were once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to its role as a spoiler, but played that role perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a half game of Houston Hall for the second American League wild card spot.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Detroit, if only for a night, it was a return of the three letters F-word, which has a large portion of the second half of the season, it was hard to take.</seg>
<seg id="7">"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="8">Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support, when Detroit three times in the first two innings scored, then again in the sixth, and then again in the ninth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) struck six times on the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is difficult to throw in the Bullpen of every game, and that is why I want to go entirely concentrated in the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated Tiger pitchers Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first rbis since the middle of August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was the first place hit game by Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on 6 July.</seg>
<seg id="15">"He has swung the wood well," Ausmus said.</seg>
<seg id="16">He saw a good blow from the (training), looked much better in the Bullpen, and he brought it directly into the game.</seg>
<seg id="17">With three runs in the background at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.</seg>
<seg id="18">Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double off the left field line.</seg>
<seg id="19">Right Fielder Aaron Hicks had a parking, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by the left-handed Grover Cleveland Hardy.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with a crown of thorns (gilded) is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus old Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now published with magnificent images.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has made over 150 motifs of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms has received the 75 year olds - but what is not synonymous with "funny" images.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, in line with the relevant issues that may seem pretty bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he is a subjective and artistic choice from the many areas of "Book of Books".</seg>
<seg id="10">Born cycles that address issues such as Way, plagues, bids or are our father.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler Verlag, with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as the author Klaus old post, who has worked on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible is especially challenging.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt, and so to the present day, "translated into current relationships.</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist, who is his own personal thoughts on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewellery cover has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">This allows the 75-year old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine of Order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"The education was" already with the cane, Otmar Alt recalls.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I have tried to come to terms with it, in order to cope with me, perhaps with the Lord father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern is to bring the art of fast moving time to more important: "The perception of visual worlds from advertising, and that is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is out there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different pleasure and bliss to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect, I am a dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images "fall" will be able to allow them to see and feel what power they have, "the image to his counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus old Post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-old Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "" has always been a lover of Otmar Alts was art: "I like how he sees with his life."</seg>
<seg id="29">Alt did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but selected the key for him, even mysterious topics.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says old post: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." As a Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Möhler Alts images speak for both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation will be opened.</seg>

<seg id="1">Robot cars: Government wants to lead for Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the federal government to change the car technological pioneers.</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."</seg>
<seg id="5">The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, Dobrindt said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries to discuss at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The strategy of the Transport Ministry, among other things, emphasises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid Umstiegs on digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the testing of new technology, a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently under construction.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thus, any additional liability risks are saddled with the driver, "" the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, for example, Germany wants to engage internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, the federal government wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention, which stipulates only the people as a driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "were not expected until well after 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The digital networking of the cars can be safer and more efficient to run on the road," said the SPD transport politician Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of personal data, however, the driver needs to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="19">The German self driving cars, however, are sceptical - much more than the French or the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Wednesday at the AA's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years will prevail, only 32 percent expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of respondents expect with autonomous driving cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control over the entire trip on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the highway that could be present in the flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well, one in four would car control under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of major fashion show and a wax figurines-shop of horrors: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63), on Wednesday in Munich, an exhibition of his work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: Mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">You have the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of the Haute Couture, because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Before, it was bleached, now it is" genuine, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The 100 To The catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), on 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung is seeing, it is fortunate that the fashion designer of his initial opposition to a show about his person has changed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, he had been against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When one dies, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diedrich said more.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the end is hard to work for the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="14">The show is not arranged chronologically, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total work of art, which was used for a lot of effort: In order to fudge the dolls, for example, has built a Stylist.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons of material, the maker, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot gekarrt to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special treat: A leather trousers-outfit with a corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also old Teddy's tires can be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He stands for the first, tentative steps of designer fashion.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child, he was not a good student (and) bad in football, he was attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing with a doll, his parents had not allowed him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The design of the fashion he had taught himself later.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers looked at how Gaultier told in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later, I bought the then of course.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener tip as a fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">Before it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making meters.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace in a large amount of customers who, for example, they processed to blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">That no longer works alone, Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of fashion tip Plauen explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt gives some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, says the vintage fashion, which in past eras, a growing business potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche, is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, they already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen, along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they can wear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales are tonight.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private shops and wholesale, there are almost no more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customers in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today, the commodity will be manufactured in Asia, much cheaper and sold almost exclusively on chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, the export schwächle, currently to Russia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">So, enough reason for new routes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg Branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">It takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and businesses who need to think, especially economically, "Schmidt says.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball head.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the machine uses small beads in some places.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener Goldsmith champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became: "Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball head for her jewellery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region to identify with the topic of Plauener tip - young and old," says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also returns to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area, and who want a piece of memory.</seg>
<seg id="33">I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener lace.</seg>

<seg id="1">XI urges to open up the economy more broadly for the world</seg>
<seg id="2">The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, a group that has been entrusted with the management of the reform.</seg>
<seg id="3">"China should commit itself to foreign investment and expertise to attract and improve strategies for business," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on the deepening of comprehensive reform.</seg>
<seg id="4">Fostering startups and further reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.</seg>
<seg id="5">The leadership group has adopted a series of policies, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the city's reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the statement, a negative list is created to identify the sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.</seg>
<seg id="7">The system will be gradually tested and improved by testing programs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources to ensure a fair business environment and the market open, the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government will also loosen controls on the powers given to the businesses and ensure that companies decide how they run their business.</seg>
<seg id="10">The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of international economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors, other areas will be opened up to private investment.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The government will change its policy towards foreign investment and protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit, or the "Green Card" by the requirements and the application process.</seg>
<seg id="14">Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practise their activities, and use professional judges and prosecutors, was also discussed at a meeting.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large predators and consumers expect a much higher dose of nerve gifts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Food Watch, which is a working paper by the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy with full force to pregnant women and infants passed," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wolf Schmidt says that the limits of the nerve poison should be raised for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai- or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that around 50 percent of the catches are based on the current limits cannot be sold.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then, after doubling the limit only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return, the EU wants to tighten for this easing, according to food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Food Watch described it as "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually burdened so low that they already comply with the planned levels.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in small fish is "a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury for humans, a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain, especially in predators is strong.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the federal government warns that "even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website regarding the current limits, however, that a "health risks to the general population" is not expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury mainly by the coal combustion into the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German coal plants run according to a written report of the Federal Ministry for the Environment of the German Green MEP Anna Lena Baer Bock, more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanent and comprehensive" mirror "exceeded in March from the paper," quoted.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the past year were European warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.</seg>
