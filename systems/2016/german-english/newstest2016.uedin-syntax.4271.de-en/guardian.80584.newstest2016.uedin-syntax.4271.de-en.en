Experts criticise report by Public Health England on electronic cigarettes
Claims of a publicly funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined The Lancet, by they criticise the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE, the "principle" report published last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE's most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations "built on sand or stone."
Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened in order to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) Multi Criteria Decision Analysis - in order to have their opinions about the damage a synthesis of a number of products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape said that is a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors have previously received from British American Tobacco (BAT) means for an independent study.
He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding, which he joined after reports were received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but it includes several popular electronic cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco control of PHE.
The group's research "tellingly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape well.
However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.
McKee and Cape said that the allegations of PHE, that "there is no evidence so far that e - cigarettes serve as a way for smoking for children or non smokers were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that has already responded to the allegations by BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking, the national health system costs £2 billion per year.
Through the clear proof of current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.
