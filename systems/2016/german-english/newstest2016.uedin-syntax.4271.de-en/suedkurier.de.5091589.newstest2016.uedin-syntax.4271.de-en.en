Stuttgart: Remnants of tropical storm "Henry" expected in the South West
Meteorologists warn of storm gusts in the southwestern part of Wednesday afternoon.
The warm sea air flows into the country due to a low pressure area over Western Europe, told the German Meteorological Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
