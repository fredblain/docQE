For slightly overweight diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether, after the weight loss surgery, slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who received non surgical treatments.
"The mortality data will need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in Jama Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

For the new study, the researchers used data from Taiwan's Min Sheng General Hospital since 2007, they have collected in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who are subjected to this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 in this study by the end of the fifth year.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received no surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal in 29
Among those who are subjected to a surgical operation, triggered the diabetes disease completely and some at 28% to 36%.
In the medically treated group was fully in just one percent in the comparison of diabetes and, in part, with only about two percent.
In addition, the results were generally better at the controls blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in the surgery group," the authors found.
The researchers monitored the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, write the researchers.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level by about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as is reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reduced the mortality rate in five years, as the Chief researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a more complete elimination of diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people, who have undergone obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group," no increased risk of death or a kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight is seriously, as soon as the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think that we have to wait until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have strongly linked with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "
