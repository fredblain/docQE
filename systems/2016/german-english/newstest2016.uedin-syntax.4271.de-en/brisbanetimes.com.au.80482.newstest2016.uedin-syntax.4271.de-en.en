Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the view of the Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as "Special KS" came into the spotlight by the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice had to be separated by the referee, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual artist behind Bernard against Great Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was treated a little too tightly.
He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important qualifiers, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return, as a long term is an integral part of the team. "
"First of all, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
