Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
Professionally, the premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royalty, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it is increasingly clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simuliertes yawn and an arm's length away, to be on a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Robert Zemecki's director and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere in 30 years.
"It is really for me," Spielberg said, "was undoubtedly the greatest journey movie ever filmed."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
