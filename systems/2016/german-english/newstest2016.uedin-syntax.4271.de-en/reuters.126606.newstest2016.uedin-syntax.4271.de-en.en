NHC says 60% chance ahead of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system about midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles has a 60% potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, added the weather experts stationed in Miami.
