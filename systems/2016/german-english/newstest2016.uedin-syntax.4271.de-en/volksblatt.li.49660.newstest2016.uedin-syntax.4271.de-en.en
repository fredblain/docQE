Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a previously anonymous place on Wednesday in the park on the Oppio Hill was baptized in the name of the German Reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero" he is now a "German theologian of the reformation."
The park is located right next to the Colosseum in ancient Rome.
The name change was requested by the Association of Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens - Martin Kruse, pastor of the Town - Lutheran community in Rome, reminded Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority often only able to live their faith in secret.
The space will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483 - 1546) as a young Augustinian monk held around the New Year in Rome in 1510 / 11 a few months.
He felt the city at that time as verkommenes sins of Babel.
His negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome in the view of historians.
Luther had then introduced the division of the Western church with his theses against the selling of indulgences.
