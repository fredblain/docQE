Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers, thus not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long term study.
The good news: Not decreases the risk quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
It is clear from the long term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
The risk of losing their teeth early compared with nonsmokers, smokers that you up to 3.6 times higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
Causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the tooth meat stresses the DIfE.
For this gum disease, smoking is a risk factor, say the authors.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
Unknown to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research. "
However, it could take more than ten years before the risk back to the level of nonsmokers sinke, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham.
We need to persuade people to be smoking, study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE said: "Smoking shortens the life."
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to a good dental health into old age according to our findings.
In Germany are affected about 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of toothlessness, DIfE shared with.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long term study untermauere the findings.
