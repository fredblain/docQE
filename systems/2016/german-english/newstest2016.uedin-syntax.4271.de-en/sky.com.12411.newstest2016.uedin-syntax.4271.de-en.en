Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man being put to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma state penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already on his best friend for the first time in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day was nearing, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and as many more applications than places available, will take place a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected, it will observe without emotion.
I cannot do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glossips inner friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I must simply try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me to abandon my impartiality on Twitter.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
They admitted that they "can make it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things that I have said and written.
He tells me not what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter is present, in order to write.
When he dies, he thinks that will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.
I am not going to go back on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty, to be a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters, to whom you can turn for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.
