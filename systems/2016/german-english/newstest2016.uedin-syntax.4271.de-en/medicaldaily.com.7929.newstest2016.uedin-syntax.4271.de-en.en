Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy breastfeeding diet
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS tried, in a shocking way, educate women about how important good nutrition is during the silent era, it does so with the presentation of images of babies sucking on breasts, which are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher caloric intake is not the only dietary adjustment, should make the mothers.
Under the direction of Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, a recent study showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies, and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can adversely affect the immune system of the child.
