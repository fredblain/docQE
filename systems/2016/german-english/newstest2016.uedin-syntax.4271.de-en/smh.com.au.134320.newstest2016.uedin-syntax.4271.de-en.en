After moist police chase, he persuaded to come out of the canning River
The canning Vale police officer remained dry when he persuaded the man from the canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth, the police treasure, was unsuccessful, as he was in the marshy and shallow water, only a few metres away from a police officer who tried to persuade "him gently to return to shore."
Canning Vale's police was called on Tuesday to a house of peace breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of canning River.
But he was not too far.
"He was in the water and said 'I have not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan negotiated Perhavec was not too enthusiastic to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the ditch, in order to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben cousins - Biathlon.
