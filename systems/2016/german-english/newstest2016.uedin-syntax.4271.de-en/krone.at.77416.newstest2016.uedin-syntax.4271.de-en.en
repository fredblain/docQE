Croatia: "We let the refugees through"
"Now the border controls will also ramped on our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl Leitner.
The controls on the Hungarian border remain upright at the same time.
Still, it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also make that 'of course'.
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground.
Is also clear, "that it needs clear signals," the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even on the Austrian - Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is denied "corridor" - Slovenia
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw that Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana, however, do not.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary -.
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area, on the other hand, already heavily controlled.
As the Minister pointed out, Slovenia will not seal its borders for refugees.
"Each EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system may not work," Györkös Znidar noted.
As the Croatian government announced, had the first refugees already in the night hours on Tuesday tried to enter the border in Eastern past Tovarnik / Sid, in order to evade the registration.
The Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media since the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees.
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the next few days count his country with around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko politics.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian - Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in Beijing.
The government in Belgrade anweise denied, however, that it is the people to embark on certain routes: "Neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports is in any case a first bus in the morning with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, more buses are expected over the course of the day.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police has said that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually come to the postponement of the Balkan route to date already predicted by observers of Turkey - Greece - Macedonia - Serbia - Hungary on a track located to the west.
Croatia: "Extensive opportunities for border control"
Politics of Croatia's interior minister had previously stressed that his country was prepared for possible emergency situations appropriate plans in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
Details he was not, he however pointed out that Croatia as non Schengen members have extensive opportunities for border control.
We have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia is a good testimony that since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since then, as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence to about 300 refugees.
According to Belgrade media reports she had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities remain the two crossings Horgos and Backi gradually continue to be completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nelise Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: It seems the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.
Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helper rates to migrants - and dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not without risk: In some parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern has been sent to the border region.
