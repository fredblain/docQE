Google launches Verdoppelungs - fundraising campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Verdoppelungs fundraising campaign, which aims to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations, is intended to help the thousands of refugees who have overtaken the European nations, as they flee from the war torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach with the announcement of the donations call on his blog.
Instead of a manager to make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote about their personal experiences.
"On our trip included many dark rail and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people such as my family are looking desperately for help.
The donations will go to four charities that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of $5.5 million on google.com / Refugee Relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by four years of civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many people fleeing from the war torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya as well.
