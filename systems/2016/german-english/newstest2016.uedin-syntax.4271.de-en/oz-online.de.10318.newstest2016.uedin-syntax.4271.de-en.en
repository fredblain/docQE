Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the cottage settlement on the Little Sea in Emden take shape.
The investor said plans for the project for the first time in public.
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the selling off of their leisure sanctuary
For months had been negotiated behind closed doors, pondered, debated and scarred.
Now plans are on the table for a new cottage settlement on the Little Sea near Emden.
The prospective customer, the midsize Emder company "system building," said on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council his plans publicly for the first time.
Originally had this item on the public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP Group, which accuse the investors and the administration's secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system construction management went on the offensive: "We still do not have an answer to all the questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The expensive around ten to twelve million euro project is in the discussion for months.
Strong reactions among marine shops owners who had come to the meeting, called the images and new details on the desired Hotelbau.
Roberto Schulz, marine shops owner and a board member with the interests of the local residents, Pro Hieve, complains: "This is a huge block that overlooks all the other building."
He like many other project critics also fear that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply: "That whole Busladungen must come, so that it makes sense," says Schulz
What exactly is happening on the well a hectare site of the former restaurant, however, is still open.
Still, there is no operator.
"First we must have a more consistent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the building plans are also more variable.
