Seven's sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of nine to take the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to report to Canberra following the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has provided no major shifts in the ratings for today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull was the overthrow of Tony Abbott.
Sunrise's rival, with the hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one week series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance 339.000 seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as sunrise reached an average 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to today.
Today, a slight increase on the ratings for Monday (317.000) and Tuesday (283,000), but his number was back behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has closed the gap on sunrise in recent months.
In August, today average 318.000 compared to 330,000 of sunrise.
At the beginning of the year was the distance between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, sunrise average 349.000 spectators 314.000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning.
The winds of change affect people more than Parliament this morning!
Karl and Lisa are in order, thank you for the review!
