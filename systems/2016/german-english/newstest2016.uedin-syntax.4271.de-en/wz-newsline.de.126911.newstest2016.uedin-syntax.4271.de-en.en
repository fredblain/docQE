Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures - "shop of horrors": The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: Thanks to video projections, the mannequins look frighteningly human.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was with her stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene, among other things, and that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture, because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it is real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo - Cultural Foundation from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial opposition to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
If you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made station in Montreal, Canada and in Paris.
"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It was about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the little plant to have views of the man who has made history of fashion without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
Chronologically, the show has not been established, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total art work, for which there was a great deal of effort: To cook the puppets, for example specially hired a stylist.
14 tons of material, the makers have that according to the curator Thierry Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special treat: A leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Horse animal old teddy is on display in the exhibition.
It is fashionable for the first, tentative steps of the designer.
As a child (he was a good student and a bad thing in football), he attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents would not allow him to play with a doll.
The design of fashion, he taught themselves later.
He stole fashion magazines and was told the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.
Later, I bought it of course.
For his first own fashion show, he cannot pay for the models.
You got nothing, but could keep the clothes.
