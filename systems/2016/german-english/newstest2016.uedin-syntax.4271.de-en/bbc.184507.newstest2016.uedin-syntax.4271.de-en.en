The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The Managing Director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage could mean for UK workers "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could make the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
