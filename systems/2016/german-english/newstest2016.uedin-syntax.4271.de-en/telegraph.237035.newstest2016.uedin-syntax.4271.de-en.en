Friends: The comedy show, which grants us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now has become even more desperate than ever, as shown on a 15 year high suicide rates among young men.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of calling into question the culture that prevents men to seek help if they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight, in order to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that, if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy" mood, doubled his chances of recovery.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so a friendship can work.
In the age of communications conducted on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, funny and successful life, even if in reality dominates the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a profound impact on our mental health.
And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money cannot buy happiness really.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but his personality, which was due to the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing between Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.
The old saying "I come to make sense of it" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if you talk about problems openly. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more permanent management mechanisms.
They clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status on the phone may also help the people in times of despair, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central friends stuck with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink with the Central perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone just sitting around in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - tied for # friends
