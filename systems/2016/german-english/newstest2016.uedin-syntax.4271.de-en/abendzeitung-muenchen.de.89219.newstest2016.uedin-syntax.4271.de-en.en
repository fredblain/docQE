Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential development, with views of the North Sea.
In the street, a square metre of a thatched roof house costs on average EUR 73,300.
"On the island of Sylt, the range of objects is limited by its very nature," says in the study - that is the high price.
A new study shows special situations in which a square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student room in Munich are not really little.
In contrast to Germany's top residential places comes at a price, however, such as peanuts.
The real estate service provider of Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices to dizzying heights.
Nix - there are times of several thousand euros per square meter, mind you.
But, well, who can afford's...
By the way: Munich is here for once and not at the top.
