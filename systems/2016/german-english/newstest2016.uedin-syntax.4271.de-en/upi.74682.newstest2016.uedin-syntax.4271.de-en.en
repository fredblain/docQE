'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional climbers and operation help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $1 million.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never seen a competition participants could complete all stages of the obstacle course.
During the final season, managed two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, to the finals.
The last task was climbing on a 75 foot long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the job within the time, and he was the first athlete who completed the arduous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero ended this challenge a full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard fought victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I've never had earned more than $10,000, or to live," said Isaac E! Has a bunch of money.
So all of a sudden... I cannot even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
The senior producer Kent weed, Britten, although he finished first at the circuit, with The Hollywood Reporter, in order to discuss the final and why did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalists, it gets the one with the fastest time," weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changed, he receives the great gratification.
I do not believe that he harbors any resentment about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I were to be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same way, if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, the filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
