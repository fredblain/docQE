As you share your stories, pictures and videos with BBC News
BBC News - on television, on radio and online - will bring you the latest stories from all over the world... every day, but what we want to hear are the issues that are important to you.
The role that you play in creating the news is very important.
Whether it is news or an issue you dargestelltes, your contribution can make a difference.
Have you seen an event or were you affected?
Is something significant, bizarre or unusual in your environment?
Do you have a story to tell, or is there something that you should follow in your view?
Are there issues about which you would like to launch talks?
What would you like to comment?
Or do you want to know what others are talking about?
