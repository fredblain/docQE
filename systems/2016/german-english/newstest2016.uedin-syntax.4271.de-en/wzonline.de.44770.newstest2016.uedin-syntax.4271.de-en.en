Disney plans new films as "Mary Poppins"
Legends should not be anr√ºhren, but Disney still dares to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
This is according to "Entertainment Weekly," but not an Emmy, but a kind of sequel, 20 years after the first film to play with the magical nanny.
It is about the Nanny's experience with the Banks family in England during the Great Depression.
Anyone who plays Blake more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" at the cinema.
