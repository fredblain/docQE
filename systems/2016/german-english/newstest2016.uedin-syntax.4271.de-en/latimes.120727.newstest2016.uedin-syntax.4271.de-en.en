At its most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Disrespectful about them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will start on Thursday announced that the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate near zero since late 2008.
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal debt - and it is only about a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chef√∂konomin Maklerfirma Bodies Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which confuses the financial market in itself.
About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate hike this week.
Financial markets expect the Fed waiting, however, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance of an increase.
This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the strategists to soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday 16.599,85 jumped on the Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert 228,89 points or 1.4%.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.
If you do it, "they would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets, so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
As recently as a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
In spring and early summer, Yellen had said that this year they expect despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed, an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was consistently below the central bank's 2% annual target, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices.
The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market, "said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world had zuckten late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, while the Dow is now at almost 10% below the peak in May.
For the Fed's representatives should influence the market turmoil the complex calculation when you increase the interest rate.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now says he predicted that they would wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is none of the Fed's main concern, so technically they should not be involved in their decision making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank was enormously in the last few years.
The mere hint of the former leader could "narrow" Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed's monetary expansion in 2013, triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor the developments in other places, but also with other central banks, experts advise, in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the company's asset management Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is committed to a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England to set interest rates.
The recent turmoil do not come near this level, he said.
"It is certainly not in the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should rush ahead of time.
