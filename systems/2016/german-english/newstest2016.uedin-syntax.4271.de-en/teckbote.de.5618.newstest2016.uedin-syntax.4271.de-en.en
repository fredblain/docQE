"I cannot imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior officer.

For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift to inspire the family is so in the blood.
"Us, it is important that wegzuholen people from their daily routine and take them for two hours in a completely different world," said the 27 year old junior officer.
"Manegencocktail flair of a cosmopolitan city," Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
This flair can now see 50 cities on the tour almost 3 000 kilometres long.

"The animals are part of our family," said Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuse in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes this position: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each canvas of pranks.
The "four legged artists," as they are affectionately called, is to read each desire of the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal feel unwell, it is also not in the riding school.
So the top priority: Good care for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra filly, the Probst family is proud.

"But then, suddenly, there was our small Jumbo," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is still not ready for the riding school, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst, however.
For every visitor should therefore be something.
"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and do it with all my heart."
