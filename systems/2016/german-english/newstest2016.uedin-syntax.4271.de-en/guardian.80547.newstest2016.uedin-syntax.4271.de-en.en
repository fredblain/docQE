Surely David Cameron knows better The Lorax?
It is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company super camp, and continues: "Funny, moving, and creative with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflect a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest, however, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage, who died in 1991, was completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here is an unnamed boy Lorax Thneed rope ends once - ler, as the local environment by the greedy, trees be cases, despite the protests of the name give a Hock schnurrb√§rtigen nature, "it speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, of The Lorax 20 times in a row has not read to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but gave no further immediate comment.
