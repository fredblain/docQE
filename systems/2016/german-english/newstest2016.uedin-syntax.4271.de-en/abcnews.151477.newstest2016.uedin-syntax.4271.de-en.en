In an emergency, a professor admits to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon lamb with a slightly tremulous voice told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to stress that his "sweet dog" but still live and probably was excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block was: "To me, it does so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.
There was no indication that lamb that taught online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, two had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he has a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, according to the police shot and killed at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Wednesday said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 pm.
He said that lamb has made the fatal emergency sometime after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Einkesselte lamb life, as the police took him.
A day after the shootings at the university, the students and staff forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still are trying to get a picture of it, what motivated lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, Burmese, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were on his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had lamb mentioned in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the department of social sciences and history, which includes 17 faculty members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there have been some inclinations to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the lamb said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Mikel Sykes, another student, said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's employment policies meant that the promotion for the lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr lambs idea."
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus police later found lambs track, when he returned to Mississippi arriving from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, killed lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He holds a PhD in education in the spring.
One of the lambs of longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her the guitar playing.
At that time, it was the women flock.
All the girls melted away, if he was, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Brandon Jackson.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency, lamb said "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O Steen, said that she had been divorced for 15 years, but have remained friends and had a daughter, now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O Steen said he had never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played one or the other gig together.
O Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Juleps Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had lamb and Prentiss Night at the end of the night saw 5 September for the last time, after lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There was no indication that anything is wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the cleanup efforts and joking with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, took part in a candlelight ceremony on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil, during the Universit√§tschor sang "bright Morning Star" and "amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to move our students to return home," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss has described as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.
