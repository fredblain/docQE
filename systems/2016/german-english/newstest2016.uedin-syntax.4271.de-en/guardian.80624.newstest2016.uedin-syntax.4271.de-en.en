'Genetics' brain cells can control by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses, which have high frequencies to the human ear, in order to be heard.
The stimulus work through the activation of motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sono Genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms are usually not on ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he was found to increase the ultrasonic waves, which then invade the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP - 4 Ion channels and cells are found in the membranes of some of the worms.
The sound waves cause the opening up of these Ion channels and activating the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that bear some of their motor neurons TRP - 4 Ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the change in motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages to this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue low frequency ultrasonic waves can happen without hindrance and can then be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that it is possible to make the human neurons have been temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.
