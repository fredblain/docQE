Jewellery instead of curtain - "head as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long stick machines in and around Plauen, to make metres.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were further processed in large quantities for customers such as blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Plauen fashion tip.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early days of the "top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: Head in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
At Stanford University, called the vintage fashion, much of past eras, an increasing order potential.
Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen lace and embroidery is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association. "
Only they can bear the protected label.
In the last 15 years has about 80 percent of sales.
Private shops and wholesale, there is almost no more.
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.
The mass manufactured goods will be much cheaper in Asia today and sold almost exclusively on chains.
Also, the export schwächle, currently in Russia and in the United States.
So enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we produce a quality seal, which shows that we are ecologically and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches Berger in the snow of Westsächsischen Hochschule Zwickau, at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and specializes in embroidery and lace.
Find high quality and innovative products to counter the competition from the Asian region.
This takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses in particular need to think economically, "Schmidt said.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago revived the historic pyramid top textile designer Kati Reuter.
The machine uses small beads in some places.
The "gold champion Bianca Hallebach Krauße could inspire them:" Before I could not start with traditional "top."
Now she uses the pyramid tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the subject" tip - young and old, "Reuter said.
It also supplies in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers, whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.
I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of the "tip.
