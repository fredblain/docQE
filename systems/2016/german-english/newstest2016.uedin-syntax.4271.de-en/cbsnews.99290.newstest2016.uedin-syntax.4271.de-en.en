Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's halved ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58% previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions, it is clear which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent than the other candidates in the election.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have reduced.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is here only by 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton still has a large lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support it because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support it.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters are also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.
If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders, will increase by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.
However, on the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions of eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is the primaries as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in a number of important characteristics in their party's primary voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views in general.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State continues to be asked, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans is now unhappy with its statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them as a whole: Only 32 percent among registered voters see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not regard it as an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump will get good marks for leadership, however.
Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush cut best with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders is more likely to be honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
