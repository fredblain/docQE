'Shot in Joburg': Homeless young people trained to photographers
The centre of Johannesburg, is a fierce place, if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was recorded in Joburg stranger shot) is a nonprofit studio that teaches homeless young people in it, how they take pictures of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has made one of the first graduates of the project.
