Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of thorns (gilt) is one of the main works Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible now appeared with beautiful images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
His "language" with bright colors and imaginative forms has received the 75 years old - but by no means is synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the particular issues, it may well seem rather bleak.
Around three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken from the many areas of the "book of all books" a subjective artistic choice.
The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads, plagues, bids or Our Father.
He is fascinated on several partners: This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost who has dealt with the relevant biblical passages on the basis of painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so on Today, "translated" in the current context.
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting.
They are between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence each of the artist, who has put his own personal thoughts on the current situation.
The jewelry box has golden letters.
This allows the 75 year - old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christmas orders at all.
"Since the education with the cane ever happened," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to do the father come to me perhaps again with the Lord."
His second concern was to help the art at the time passes back to more importance: "The perception of worlds is now dominated by advertising, and is loud.
Symbolism is out there.
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this regard, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images' fall ', they can act on it, and feel what power they have: "The picture is his counterpart."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he sees life with his pictures."
Age did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but are important to him, also selected mysterious issues.
"This was no cooperation on an equal footing," all old post explained: "This is about the images, the text says." The result is a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler from publishers Luther is this work to find an invitation, "to deepen his life and freedom."
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler both the responsibility and the (biblical) language of love.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.
