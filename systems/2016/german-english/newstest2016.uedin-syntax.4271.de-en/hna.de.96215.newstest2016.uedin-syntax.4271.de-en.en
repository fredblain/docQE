Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees, but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I can show how to build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are in the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are in the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people are to a large extent here.
In the face of the refugee flow, we also need adequate housing in the next few decades.
A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, if it brings people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Six months has taken the construction.
This is appropriate.
The building regulations have complicated their plans?
Gildner: Construction law, I have learned through my project properly.
It is particularly complicated always expect the looming sword and the pitch regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is not the place for it.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents responded to her townhouse project?
Gildner: There have been those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But do not tighten the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: Is true: We had a construction boom in the last five years in Germany, but luxury apartments have been built, can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing too.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.
I show how we can still build well.
That is what this is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analysis.
