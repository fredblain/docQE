"Cassini" space probe will be ocean on Saturn moon study
Under the Eispanzer Saturnmonds study is a global ocean.
These include researchers from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft. "
So is the moon in its orbit around the planet.
This tumbler movement is only small, but still too big for a consistently solid celestial bodies, says in a statement of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (US State) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "ICARUS".
For some time, know that there needs to be a study of liquid water under the ice.
"Cassini" as early as 2006 Eisvulkane discovered at the south pole of the Saturnmonds, feed the steam and Eispartikel spit and thus the E ring of Saturn.
At the very least, there should be an underground sea at the South Pole, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not resolved.
