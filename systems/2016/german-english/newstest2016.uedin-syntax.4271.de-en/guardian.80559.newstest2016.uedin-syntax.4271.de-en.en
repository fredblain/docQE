Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when you look at the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, a repeat of the 3 - 0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out a home victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less than it was three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars from 2012, only a youthful and positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin - Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.

The decision to let Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.
Long ago, the race would be extended from Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, is another opportunity.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he is not so good services rendered, and this does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test - a man gets to put his character is difficult.
Lyth had seven opportunities, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad.
The only criticism one can make that Jonathan Trott, England first began in the Caribbean, when Lyth was in peak form, but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex is catastrophic, and he is a hit man, which I appreciate.
He is an X factor - cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us on a Trent Bridge pitch 236, which hit us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team at a position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen beat along with Cook, which would provide an extra spin - Bowler and receive four Quicks appeared on, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man cannot beat them, and this has already shown that he is a vicious guy of cricket players left - handed.
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.
He has made three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari is the spinner in the squad as back up, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People might see his statistics, an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball, and think it is a punt, but there are a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of the batsman Mahela Jayawardene from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is for the white ball - phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful force in the setup.
I always felt that he has created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the above.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben stokes, is not used in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will disagree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart.
