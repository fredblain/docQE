Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What comes to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even capable of a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we do that."
What is in store for Germany gives the following overview.
Homes a year are needed for different forecasts between the Bundesbauministeriums 350000 (estimate) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) - and in the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as before is built choices (housing).
Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties: Every year, there are 60,000 to 80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing refugees will also apply.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion, from currently $518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that the federal government would have to invest in a promotion to the tune of $6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and federal construction minister agree on is that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that 55 per cent of the area in the long term can be employed in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, is crucial, whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self - esteem of immigrants, says migration for Cher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political change according to Thränhardt: The ban on work for refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years in the past, this was limited to three months, as well as the residence requirement, the asylum seekers at a residence in November 2014.
In society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - mostly the view prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of German language skills.
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most commonly transmitted through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is the royal road to integration work according to Thränhardt.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents give their children in the key signature, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents only once, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
The family still to be convinced of the benefits of this option, the administration distributed hand slip in different languages.
Should the need for educators to rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.
In those countries, students are not prepared to welcome classes on the teaching of English.
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including from teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers Schulverwaltung from Berlin.
The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or patience, the study - the only exception has been Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitating access to university.
For refugees with a residence permits or more if they begin a study of asylum seekers will receive no benefits under the current law.
The latter are generally no Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of people entitled to trainees.
CADTM refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, to be Bafög - justified, in that span is shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016.
This funding gap needs to be closed, however, claim crash, Berlin's undersecretary for science, and the Deutsches Studentenwerk Steffen.
The students should receive Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should give the same rights to Islam gradually as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship.
It would also be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association of professional cares about the new arrivals.
Belong to the rights and obligations.
As the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to take bold action against religious fundamentalism.
Ayman Mazyek, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday.
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited their right to dwell here, in Germany, immediately," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration will be much more than an issue of the whole society today in the future.
It will also have to change the majority of society, will be pressing the elimination of discrimination and racism.
Germany has a point against discrimination and a general equality law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the spirits - murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all, not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups have been demanding and what international agreements such as the Anti Racism Convention oblige Germany needs to become a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities, for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to supply the refugees expected to date medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"With regard to MAN power and capabilities, we create it," he told the daily mirror.
However, should make extra money flowing into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, calls for Montgomery, hand over all arrivals for the registration of health cards.
Services provided could be charged later with the provinces.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to mislead so many people with a limited catalog of performance, the performance of the asylum law propose.
Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.
So far, it has proven the Berlin Gesundheitswissenschaftlerin Thea Borde, migrants are less aware of their disease than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be accepted, she asks.
Many refugees would have helped but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic views.
Among refugee children, for example, will give it much more unprocessed disability, and go to HIV awareness among young people.
German doctors came with the images of some other disease in terms of their education but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasite infections and tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as regards the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, and may once again professional examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK): Most are suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK explains.
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder is ill, including so called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, and palpitation Todesängsten.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, strong shock and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms were chronic, early treatment is needed, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Mentally ill asylum seekers in social services can make a request for psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.
Most clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, in social services would also decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz said.
