Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes ring to fight back against rivals because of allegations
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the tack of his players as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players "ring" struggles with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team, after his team had reached the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the struggle.
Bellamy, the Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were at the tack, focusing only on their "contact".
Bellamy added that the criticism of the two leading trainers on his team made him confident agree, because it means that they are concerned, to be beaten by the Storm team.
"It appears over and over again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling fights, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has been the trend for us.
Trent is now there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not accustomed to lose, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how this appears again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked the Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and recalled his mentor, that Bennett's St George Illawarra dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long because a" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting the game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George has been criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said that he is a shit dirt will look into this matter.
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play, if you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play the kind of football that everyone - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence, because they say these things, because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought of us, when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters reached a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos game was a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two further attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?
Or breaks and no points are a little bit more exciting?
For me, it is the game plans.
If you mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage on it.
The Storm team has this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park on Saturday night. The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.
