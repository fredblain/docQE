Jeremy Corbyn's debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's eagerly awaited debut in the Time of the Prime Minister
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the Time of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will probably rise up to make the first of his six preset questions shortly after midday, with his performance of the media and the Labour MP for the area will be examined.
He called for "less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he might skip some sessions to be left to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet, and after his speech to the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday to remain in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory most recent and is at the heart of several covers stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had "been in a respectful silence" and he had "recognised the" heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they are called to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him initially as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences are also within Labour 'stack' after Mr Corbyn's remarks to the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour amendments on the table to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman of the Tory leader David Cameron, since he is, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 comments.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will do both "repartee" and arguing with barbs and instead made to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister will represent him, if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he raised, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, in order to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove themselves from the policy in the style of an "opinion" theater, which is often linked to the Time of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and its position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and needs major reform.
