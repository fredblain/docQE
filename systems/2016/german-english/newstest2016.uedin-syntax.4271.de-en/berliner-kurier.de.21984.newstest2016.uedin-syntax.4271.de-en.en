Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, a megastar.
A paltry 21 years young, HÃ¤nfling Frise with upper Chi emails.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is hard to 100 million euros.
Rather, even more.
Monsieur Bieber currently is in Berlin.
And the generation defeated rotates through.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 - year old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Pole sits on the cold stone slabs of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber construction: Here is her idol, whose poster plenty hanging in Szczecin, since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, the day costs just as much as their mom deserves Ewa in the half year.
If at all.
It says: "My th would actually have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I fulfilled a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who's pussy?
The fans are not.
Not including Bieber himself.
It has been anyway.
He received three million for the advertising in the ad break of the super bowls, a two year deal with an anti- pimple company raked many, many dollars in the Bieber Account.
And each doll that looks like it and over the counter, Bieber pockets, too.
When Justin Bieber is drinking a cup of coffee, you check on the windowpane.
More than 100 million should have captured it.
Some say that the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber is, after all, is currently ranked number 1 in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?"
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is set to follow in November, like the many zeros do right now.
At least he is doing so.
