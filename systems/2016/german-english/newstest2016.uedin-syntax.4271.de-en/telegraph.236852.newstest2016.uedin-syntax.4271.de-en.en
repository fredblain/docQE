Hewlett Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett Packard is expected of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and Einsparungs - efforts to reduce the company's services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year, and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing corporate hardware and its services business.
The expected job cuts will lead to a load of more than $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"This restructuring will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, to lead the unit after the separation.
"HP Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses, the companies support the transition to a new style of doing business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses," according to a statement of the company.
It disperses a company that was founded by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to the graduates of Stanford University in the 1930s, in order to establish electric plants and their Palo Alto garage has called it "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift away from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in this area, which is based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide a better performance.
