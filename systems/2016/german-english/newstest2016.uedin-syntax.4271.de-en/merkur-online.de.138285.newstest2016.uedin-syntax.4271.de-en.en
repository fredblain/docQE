Exceptions to the new Bern Rieder sports hall
The council of Bern Ried approved Bauantrag expensive sports hall for the 2.3 million euros.

The plans for the long awaited turn pictures on Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the elaborated Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The panel had previously decided, among other things, a request for a demands an "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was for permission for a special form on the roof structure.
A "saddle roof with concentric First and roof should therefore be built on state '.
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels: "As a result, we get a wonderfully big southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said at the meeting.
The "liberation" was again on the roof inclination for energetic reasons, unlike required in the development plan, is expected to fall below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope will not permit "exceptions" - and the council of Bern Rieder usually rather restrictive in visa applications.

The buildings at the centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Turn Bernried.
