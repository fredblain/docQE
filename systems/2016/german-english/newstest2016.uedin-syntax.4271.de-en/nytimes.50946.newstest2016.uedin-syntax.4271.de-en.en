4 people killed after police fire rubber bullets at demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a 4 year old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.

Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, and some of you threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal said that the police have used tear gas and then fired into the air, before they handle back to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, one of which is aware that they can kill it, but which is traditionally used as a less lethal alternative seems to have produced such a high death rate.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces, which are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution, would reduce its political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were in violent clashes since the 10th
August killed, as the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008, but the legislature had accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted on certain provisions in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said that the new constitution would come into force on Sunday.
