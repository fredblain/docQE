Robot cars: Government will lead to Germany
Germany should be technological advancements in the transformation of the car after the will of the federal government.
The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new automotive era on Wednesday on the sidelines of the IAA auto show in Frankfurt."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.
The strategy of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
The testing of new technology is currently a test track at the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
To be saddled with the driver "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
Like Germany, for example, internationally to ensure that the speed limit for cars drive themselves will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h.
The federal government will also push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far only the people as drivers.
In automated driving takes the lead in increasing the car, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process the information in a matter of seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Yet driverless vehicles on public roads "were to be expected until well after 2020."
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany, the study's authors estimate for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in the event of an accident and the security of the personal information of the driver should be clarified, however.
Yet the Germans see cars drive themselves skeptical, however, much more than the French or Americans.
A poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra presented on Wednesday at the AA has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, in 20 years with this count of 32 percent, 31 percent do not think at all about it.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33% by 2025 with autonomous driving cars in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to cede control over the entire ride on all roads.
On the motorway could imagine that as much as 15% in flowing traffic, 45 percent in a traffic jam.
Good one in four car would leave the control under any circumstances.
