Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Baruch College - newcomer
Almost two years after a student died during a ritual of bullying a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.
Brutally attacked members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta PSI fraternity chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said that he had been charged with related eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and have been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out on a frozen field on a goal.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.
They had the time to switch to Deng's clothing, Googling his symptoms and to contact Andy Nordic, the national president of the Brotherhood, however, in order to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the Brotherhood in principle about the police chief Michael Deng," said Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng have been repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng's, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to justice, and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a prosecution for murder, the third degree for the first five members.
32 members of the Brotherhood, including Mr volumes., are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We do not want to blame only the people involved, but if there is one organisation that, officially or unofficially, has sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.
