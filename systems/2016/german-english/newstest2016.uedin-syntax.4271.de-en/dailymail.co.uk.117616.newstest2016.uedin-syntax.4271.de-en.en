Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of the year 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has curbed spending in November
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping geboomt and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagnate, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth, the lowest since records began in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year.

"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has developed in the course of time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG sales index.
He explained that the online sales increased from three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people were able to shop online, and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now the commute, and we will probably experience reduced growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place each year on the last Friday in November,.
Last year rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bargains and some dealer websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyer is fighting for bargains, could deter buyers to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending just over £1 of £5 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now done via web shops.
More than a quarter of the people at the same time buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
