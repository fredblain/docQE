Di Maria is, in order to help PSG to crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates after his match against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
Di Maria is in his debut in the Champions League in Malmö on Tuesday and help PSG pull over.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course, when Paris Saint Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 - 0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of opportunities, before they finally increased their lead when Cavani a Kopfballtor scored in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only want the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of goal. He was replaced later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems to our opponents and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that in the course of the season, we have yet to perfect," said Blanc.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more goals. "
Manuel returned in one of three changes in the Paris team after his injury, which could keep a 2: 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league at the weekend, but he has been surpassed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been described as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the defence in Malmö, before he graduated nicely in the corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if someone believed that PSG would make a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play off, in order to reach this stage, came with nine national players on the field at Anpiff and strung with a five man defence and two deep in the midfield was a serious opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic went far past Kevin Music posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG patzte even sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least by Inter, with no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
However, he showed much more skill, which was directed by Wiland past the post in the 52nd minute, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Manuel Di Maria turned into a spin shot...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter had got a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could keep low, before substitute players was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, announced later that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris. "
It was a great game from them.
