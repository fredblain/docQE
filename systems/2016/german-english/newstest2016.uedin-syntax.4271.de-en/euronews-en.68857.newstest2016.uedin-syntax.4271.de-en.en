Time of the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world observes, if the Fed comes together in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, in order to make the important decisions, whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero field and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are well against such a move.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 8pm CET
