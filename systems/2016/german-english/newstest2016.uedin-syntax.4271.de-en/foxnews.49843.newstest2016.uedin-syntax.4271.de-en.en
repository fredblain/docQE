Stars who lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had a few busy years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Always spectra, due to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
