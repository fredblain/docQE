Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League defeat by Manchester.
While this brought the outside left defender for wines and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not on the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20 year old Shaw had plummeted in the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy coming to Manchester United with 18 plays it very hard, and then fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that lasts six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed to be fortunate to escape a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal had suspected that the Italian referee got it wrong.
You can judge for yourself, if I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw account was: "I would like to thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."

The England defender has an extra incentive to recover until next June with the European Championship in France.
Phillip were the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious violation."
If a player leaves the place with this type of injury, are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It is very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you were then told that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing that I could see was the ball, which was travelling in the other direction, so that it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad and I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital, after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
