BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station because of its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
House colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" on Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the channel, to prove that he does something the private broadcasters do not.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio is "verdumme" and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems like - I do not use the word" verdummen "- but it seems to turn on Classic FM," he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, The Brits seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and information to the public.
What I learned from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I think it really is important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport for the selection of commercial rivals to engage on the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins resorted to the BBC - the musical talent show The Voice, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of Â£22 million.
See you why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and boy George as a judge, "was produced on a special BBC way '.
He added that he would find that the company "a hit from our own stall," when we launch the next time an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or to spend tax payers money on other entertainment formats.
