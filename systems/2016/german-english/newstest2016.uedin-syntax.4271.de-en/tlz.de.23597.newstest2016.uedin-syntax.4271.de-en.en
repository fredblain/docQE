A 29 - year old wanted to fulfil a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rain wet highway came the evil awakening.
In a factory in the district of Gotha, you can borrow to fulfil the dream and even a 440 HP V8 Ford Mustang Boss 302 US sports car and drive.
So this was also a 29 years from the district of Gotha.
On the A 71 in Arnstadt was the dream, then it's over.
The 29 - year - old lost control of the sports car, went into a tailspin on a wet road and drove into the guard rail.
