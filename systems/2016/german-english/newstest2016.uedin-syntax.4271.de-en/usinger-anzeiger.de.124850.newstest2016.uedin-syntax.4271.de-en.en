Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action with German involvement in Syria is a possibility.
"I believe that the firm thought about military options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states "collective blind eye."
Four years ago you would have been pleased that the chalice of military involvement in Germany has gone over.
"Now the conflict ends things on our doorstep," he said in Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for the refugees.
