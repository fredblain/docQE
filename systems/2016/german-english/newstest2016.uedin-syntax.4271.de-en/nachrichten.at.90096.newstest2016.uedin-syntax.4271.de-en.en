Now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us, is a logical outcome of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in Röszke camp immediately to help with the construction of structures that ensure humanity our chancellor has high officially and publicly brought the attitude of the Hungarian government to the orbit of National Socialism.
Victim of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now faced with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The area also will have to say that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge for us, given the ongoing refugee flows and the onset of winter, produce decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
