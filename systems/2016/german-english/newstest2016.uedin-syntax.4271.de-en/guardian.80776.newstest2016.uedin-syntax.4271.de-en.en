Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago, I moved as even forgotten 19 year old in a student residence, which is still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The collection in student residences ranges from slightly fraught to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to bleat: Tell people where you are coming from, whether and where you've taken sabbatical where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you HAHAHA "frankly Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Set questions and show interest.
It draws the conversation and helps you to find the people who you are in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyelashes were on fire and the fire extinguisher.
Let people.
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, movie night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people dress and her underwear right back.

Introvertierte get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a space on space walk - culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to leave, that I get the energy back, which I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to sense when a Man of conviviality anzuklopfen is exhausted - and send him a text message instead.
Speaking of call waiting: Do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Close friendship with baking.
As you begin the university at the height of the Back - mania, the beating on the doors of people, in order to present themselves with a plate full of brownies, is less strange than the greeting of the 1950 "" Welcome to the neighborhood, so I have something baked. And now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. "
Offering homemade treats is a good way to close friendships.
Their roommates feel obliged to entertain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
As a result of poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat, people are sleeping, if you knock on the door.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course the claws of chicken is a theft, but is also taking a drop Milchs for your tea?
Check this with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say, to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal more balanced than my resident their milk added a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should make no noise, which prevents people from sleeping or at work.
It is not just trying to be a decent man, but in the truest sense of the proverb you belong to the people who live in glass houses.
A girl on my floor asked their neighbors if it makes them a little, to make a little quieter drum & bass, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and they had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., they made their neighbours kindly still sleep two hours before they had their own music pl√§rren, completed their door and came to their three hour examination.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move randomly in the same student residence?
Conversely, it would not be abysmally embarrassing when you need to keep a newcomer for your future Ehepartnerin they yummie food separate again and see them every day and see how it pulls all the common friends to come over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot newcomer is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin, you try at least, convince your abdominal a little common sense.
Lie in the exciting moment where you notice that someone has his keys in his not verschlossenem rooms, the line between a Ulk and bullying is fine as it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang.
Give you by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close your door, and put the key in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but tackern their possessions on the ceiling is not more than twice.
