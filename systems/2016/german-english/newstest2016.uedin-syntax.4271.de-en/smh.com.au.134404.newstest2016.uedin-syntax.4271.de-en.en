Serbs with $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man may face a life sentence because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine, which were smuggled to Queensland, was released on a bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men who were arrested last month, after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, from South America to Vanuatu and plotting in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed, as he met his co in the marina in the course of the morning and later in Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life whole sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount and that the cafe for an innocuous reason might have been.
The judges on the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of flight in Maksimovic.
He has strong relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 deposit as security together, in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the oaths stately statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him, not to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he delivers his Australian and his Serbian passport, report daily to the police, and adheres to a curfew from 6: 00 to 06: 00.
