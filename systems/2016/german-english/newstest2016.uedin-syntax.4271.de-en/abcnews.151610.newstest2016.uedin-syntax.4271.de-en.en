UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the almost five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
