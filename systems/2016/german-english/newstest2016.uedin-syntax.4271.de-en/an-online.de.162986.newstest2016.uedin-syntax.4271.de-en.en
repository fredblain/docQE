EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional dishes in its operation.
"We want to set up a system, which the public trust," the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
The Swede has to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
By TTIP is the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration see specifically that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court.
They should come to equal parts of the EU, the US and from third countries.
There is also, for the first time, a second instance.
It would make it possible to appeal against sentences.
So far the procedures involved with each other agreed to referee a chance to appeal against their sentences did not exist.
In the debate over the past few months has become clear that the old system of ISDS citizens are not familiar in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.
In the long run they will work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal.
There could then be resolved, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
The investor state arbitration required mainly by large corporations (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, riding on the company compensation at the expense of the taxpayer, can scuttle national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.
First opinions anti - TTIP organizations like Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.
Criticism was, above all, that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans, on the other hand, a major advance.
The Commission was prepared to take on board in the spring with other EU trade ministers in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules restrict the legal possibilities of the economy.
Small and medium sized companies in particular could be adversely affected, they said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement can be concluded TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations run since the middle of 2013.
The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.
Originally a framework for the agreement are already at the end of this year.
This date is no longer tenable.
