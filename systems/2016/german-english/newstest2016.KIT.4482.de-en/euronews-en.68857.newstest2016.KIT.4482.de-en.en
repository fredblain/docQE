Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching, when the US Federal Reserve in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision as to whether, for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rate will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists, who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half, which only last week was of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will still remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the present level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
"For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero area and starts the process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance status, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate a low inflation.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global relationships.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances are good against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 8.00 p.m. CET on Thursday
