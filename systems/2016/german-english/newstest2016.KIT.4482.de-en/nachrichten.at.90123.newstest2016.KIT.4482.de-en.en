Seehofer: "borders are not closed off"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday of further action on the refugee issue akkordieren.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not closed off.
The passage of refugees in Germany is still possible.
However, there are now just the appropriate controls.
There will no longer be special trains with refugees to Germany.
The asylum-seekers would be brought, however, with regular trains to Germany.
The other EU member states passed once again called for more solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria on its border controls reintroduces Pühringer, "a logical consequence is for" from the actions of the Germans.
