Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his strike against Malmö.
Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to pull over to Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept track, as Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, who brought the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions, before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61 minute, a Kopfballtor scored.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, also in the group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, since they are not the only qualification for the knock-out rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team and the club, with whom he began his illustrious career back in 1999, replaced.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2-0, our opponents look to cause problems and relaxed, even if there are certain things that we have perfected over the course of the season," said Blanc.
" This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have another one or two more goals. "
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team, which could hold over the weekend, a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was hammered by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested that why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before he graduated to Johan Wiland over nicely in the long corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would be a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off, in order to reach that stage, appeared in Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was strung with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of a difficult opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, of the far post to Kevin Trapp went over in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least from Ibrahimovic, who has dropped in no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria has turned into a revolving pistol, which was drawn by Wiland in the 52 minute at the post over...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic had a left-hand flank of Maxwell especially galling.
It ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz, the final result was unable to hold down before replacement players Ezequiel Lavezzi was removed from a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: " our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying rounds are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!!!
It was a great game by them!!!
