Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell at the beginning of the year by a panel down the stairs.
He was uninjured, but the video of the event spread quickly on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by allegations of the opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and they were warned to accompany the speech by Mr. Mugabe with booing.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation speech in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) - innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians receive SMS messages on their mobile phones, which have warned them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not shown, but it has the title of ' death '," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned parliamentary members that the immunity ends in Parliament, and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman, said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about the risks to the politicians.
