Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double-fracture
Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven Manchester a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left-side defenders cry and will preclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not in the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The breach was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "he has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it is very difficult and it is fantastic, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee has not punished, the Mexicans.
Van Gaal conjectured that the Italian referee had got it wrong.
You can judge for themselves, when I say that were a penalty and a red card.
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I would like to thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how I am broke, my road to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
Referring to this: Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
The England defender has been with the European Championships in France an extra incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach said: "it is a very serious violation."
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture, when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then, when you hear that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with Moreno SBS6 said: " I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be anything.
I feel very bad. I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andr√©s Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
