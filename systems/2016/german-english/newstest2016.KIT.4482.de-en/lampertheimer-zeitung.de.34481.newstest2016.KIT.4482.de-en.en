Mannheim ecumenical hospice assistance for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is brisk business.
The people do their errands, sometimes fast, in part, breath comfortably.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim-based Auto Salon at the Parade Ground.
City cars.
Vibrant, plump life in stunning autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large panels with the heading "before I die, I would like to...."
The Ecumenical Hospice made with the help of this action on its 20-year anniversary and is faced with mixed reactions.
"It is about life, so we are left with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice aid is the same for passers-by questions and discussions are available as the volunteer staff.
While many a passerby spontaneously reverts to the chalk and the phrase "yes, my life," read ","  "ride with the campers from the US,"  "stop the war" or "long suffering" supplements, others remain short, read, say phrases like "as far as I am not yet" and then go further.
Again and again on the verge of developing small discussions about the action itself, about the life, dealing with the death.
Peter Hübinger is also on the ground.
"Only if I am clear that, for me at some point come the end of the world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the diakonisch plant in Mannheim, is the winner of the Ecumenical hospice assistance together with the Caritas Association.
Therefore, this action is effective for the public good, 20-year-olds.
Not everyone wants to say publicly on the boards, but is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The issue of death and dying is still riddled with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, albeit just the hospice movement in recent years have contributed to the open man.
An assessment of the Angelika Godefroid shares.
The companion of death and mourning is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Faced with the issue through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical hospice assistance per call was looking for volunteers, they have been reported immediately and was at the foundation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the patients and family members in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and hospice St Vincent.
They all are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with their task and the experience gained and experiences.
"I see life from a different queue, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the Ecumenical outpatient hospice service is free of charge, regardless of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from members and clubs allows for the training and training and supervision of the pet death and mourning.
Every two years will be offered training for new employees.
The panels on Saturday described are now in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the home of the Catholic Church (§F§2§,§ §6§).
There may also be other personal wishes on postcards.
