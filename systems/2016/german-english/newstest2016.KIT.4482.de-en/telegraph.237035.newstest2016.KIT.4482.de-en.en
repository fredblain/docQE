Festive friends: the comedy show, which gave us a serious lesson about male friendship
The absence of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15-year high.
It was the main cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of the culture in question, which prevents men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the battle, in order to meet this challenge.
A recent study on more than 2000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer a high percentage had plenty of friends with "healthy" mood, his chances of recovery are doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends, a friendship can work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives, the need to appear strong, vital and successful, doubled, even though in reality the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, reputation, social status, all at the expense of the intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has an impact on our mental health, much deeper.
And, like a video game creator and billionaire recently declared that money really cannot buy happiness.
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been turned on its head.
Each character has been defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the nostalgia of Ross after Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to in any case, even if they are holding back, often to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and even murder are endangered, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often do not feel able to speak with friends.
The old adage "I get on with it ' has a huge impact, as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness, if one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows, which comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendship.
So much to help my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the celebration of the day completely redesigned scenery, then why are you not your friends for a drink with in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you are sitting in Starbucks alone someone around, you give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole - 236 episodes of Friends festival
