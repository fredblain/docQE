Michael J. Fox joked about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "back to the Future" professionally was a big moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was remarkable also for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royalty, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "back in Time."
The film begins, and it occurred to me that I am a simulated GÃ¤hnen and an arms length away from being in a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time," a documentary on "back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemecki's and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere in 30 years.
"It is really for me," said Spielberg, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie that has ever been filmed."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
