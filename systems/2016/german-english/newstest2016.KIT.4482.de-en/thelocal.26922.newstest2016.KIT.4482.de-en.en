Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by collapsing commodity prices, on Wednesday gained $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan.
The company, registered in London, Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares with a value of approximately $1.6 billion pounds, in order to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices, as China's economic downturn depresses demand and wreaks havoc on markets.
The issuance of subscription rights brought Glencores share price in early trade on Wednesday morning, rocketing to the top of the London Stock Exchange.
The shares jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore last week had the $2.5 billion stock sale as part of broader plans to pay about one-third of its $30 billion in debt, announced.
The company sold new shares to 125 pence per share, which represented a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares valued at up to 9.99 per cent of the group.
