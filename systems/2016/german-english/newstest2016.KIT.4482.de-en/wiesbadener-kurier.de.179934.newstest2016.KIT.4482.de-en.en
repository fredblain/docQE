DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB is extending its commitment to refugees from until 2019, the Bundesliga at the weekend, a clear sign.
The football is responding to the deteriorating situation in Germany and secures the policy to its aid in dealing with the problems.
"I consider this to be the greatest challenge of our country since reunification."
"In principle, since no one can say that there is nothing on me, I have nothing to do with it."
"Every individual must be interested in this issue," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany.
"I am next Wednesday at the Chancellery and meet the Minister, Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"The issue is bound to play a central role," he announced.
The football can and wants to help.
But the decisive influence must be the policy.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1: 0 for a welcome" by four years.
"Over the Egidius-Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this program runs until 2019," said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA meeting in St Julian's/Malta.
Also some support for this program.
Already this weekend put the 36 professional clubs, a clear sign, if they are on the left sleeve jersey instead of the usual sponsors logos (Hermes) says "we help - Refugees Welcome."
"We also want to make clear that all are supposed to help, where and how they can," said Leverkusen sports chief Rudi Völler "image" newspaper (Tuesday) and described the plan as "self-evident."
"The refugee drama goes to everyone, no one should" look.
"We can for football, no, we must use our power, our influence and our ability to help the many refugees who have been so incredible, have suffered," said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hope Homes managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent symbol of the league."
For the European Championship qualifying match against Hungary in this Friday, the national team of the women's 100 refugees after Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support as "a large group of refugees of German football."
All 36 licensed clubs have started their own projects in their villages, is great.
Equally great is that, as small and tiny clubs are active.
"The message" 1: 0 for a welcome, which we have spent, lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this year and next year, the association is working with the DFB selection and the federal government each 300000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have taken up the whole sum for 2015 already," said Niersbach.
