Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll, halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead over the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he ran for president, receives the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their feelings are clear, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a strong lead among women and moderates, but the margin has narrowed.
Their support among men has fallen markedly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a large advantage for older voters.
Last month, Clinton was Sanders, with double-digit lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point margin in this group.
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because she is the nominee.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters in particular are fascinated by her.
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to, that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman President (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters also mentions its connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises the potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - even though one-third believes that he should not do it.
If the democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.
Supporters of Clinton's more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's increased ahead of Sanders, 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the "w√§hlbarsten," has risen.
However, with the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters cite issues of eligibility.
Much like last month stands out, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the primaries, these voters as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the important features of their party primaries with voters.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden raises the three best candidates for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many people say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries, in general, see also Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, around a quarter of Democratic voters do not agree with Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with the primaries with their explanation of the issue and say that it has not influenced their opinions.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one-third is satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on this in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of it was even worse.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them among a total of registered voters: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 fewer points since May.
62 percent of those eligible do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate can see across the country including Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, received good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush score best with honesty.
A majority of Sanders looks more honest than that, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
