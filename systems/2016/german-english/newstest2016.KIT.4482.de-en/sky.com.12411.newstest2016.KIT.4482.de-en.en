Why I am going to be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.
If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death.
The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed to.
As the day approached, I began to worry me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, it will be the unemotional.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that, I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to carry a notebook and a pencil to record what I see.
I simply must try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
You tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants, and you get access to it.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me not to write what I did, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from their list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants to write that one international reporter was present.
When he dies, he thinks that the public will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back to all the details.
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I feel sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I can't really claim to be objective.
There will be other reporters who can write.
What you will get from me, is what it is like to see a man die a needless death.
