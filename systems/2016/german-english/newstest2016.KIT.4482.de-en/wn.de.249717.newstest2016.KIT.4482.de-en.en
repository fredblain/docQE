Robot cars: government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany is supposed to be following the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer.
The German cabinet on Wednesday decided a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investment in digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, including at the IAA, along with representatives of the industry.
The strategy document of the Transport Ministry, among others, stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
The new technique is currently testing a test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
So the driver will be saddled with "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
Thus, Germany, for example, international efforts to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10% to 130 miles per hour.
The federal government also wants to push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far includes only the people as a driver.
The automated driving leadership is increasingly the car, the driver is turning more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras, which record the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Nevertheless, be driverless vehicles on public roads "until well after 2020."
The added value in terms of driver assistance systems and the high value of automated equipment in Germany, the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion.
"The digital network of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician Transport SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in case of an accident and the safety of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified.
Even the Germans, however, see self-driving cars - much more skeptically than French or American.
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be travelling in the next ten years, 32 percent expect in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe this.
In France, 21% of respondents expect to 2025 with autonomous driving cars, 33% in the US.
In any case, the car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the association Bitkom Digital would agree to only seven percent of the control over the entire ride on all roads.
On the motorway could imagine the traffic flowing as much as 15 percent, 45 percent in the closet.
Well one in four people would be left to the car's control under any circumstances.
