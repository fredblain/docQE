Seven's Sunrise dominated the ratings, despite the attempts by Nine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rushed to Canberra to report following the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has no major shifts in the ratings for Today.
The breakfast show from Nine was broadcast by the nation's capital, when Malcolm Turnbull made the overthrow of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Army days, stuck in London as part of a weeklong series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The disadvantage of the distance seemed for Australian TV viewers to play a role, as Sunrise 397000 viewers, on average, scored in the five capital cities, compared to Today 339000.
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317000) and last Tuesday (283000), but his numbers fell short of last Thursday (343000).
Today in recent months has closed the gap with Sunrise.
In August, Today averaged 318000 compared to 330000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40000 and 50000.
So far in September, Sunrise averaged 349000 viewers to 314000 in Today.
This is the most interesting what happens every morning.
The winds of change this morning affect more people than the Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review.

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with former series star of packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children, was a very impressive figure of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have wondered whether Thomson could have a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered it with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838000) and TBL Families (726000).
Seven had mixed results in two evenings of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17: 00 to 17: 30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O 'Keefe showed, on average, 446000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia 520000 viewers and in the second half-hour whopping 720000.
Hot Seat averaged 620000.
The decline in the prices of the second night of The Chase Australia is confident that Nine Hot Seat will ultimately prevail by 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to surpass the McGuires show.
