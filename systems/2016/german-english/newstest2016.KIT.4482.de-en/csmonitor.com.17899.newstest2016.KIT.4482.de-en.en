Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-tainted newcomer
Almost two years after a student during a ritual bullying a student liaison in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, died, murder charges will be filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Chun "Michael" Deng during a brutal initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he had been charged with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with eyes blindfolded, and had been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out to a goal on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, he then fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity called the emergency number 911, fainted after Deng and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police.
However, they had the time to move on to Deng's clothes, googled his symptoms and Andy Meng, to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to catch up with the Council, the police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about the Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived and he died of his injuries the next morning.
After an autopsy report, Deng has been repeatedly inflicted by blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood, at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the bullying," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, also indicted for vexatious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We do not want to blame the people involved, but only if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, so we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation to the group.
