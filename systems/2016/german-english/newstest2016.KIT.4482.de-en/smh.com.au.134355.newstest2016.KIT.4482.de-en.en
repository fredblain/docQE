Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is fighting back against rivals due to claims of fighting ring
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tackles of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referee the Storm players "wrestling" with his team during the high storm-victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his team's final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he had called the game a "textbook example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "good" in the rings.
Bellamy's Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were the only tackles on their "contact us".
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading trainers at his team confident agree with him, because it meant that they were concerned to be smitten by the Storm Team.
"It always reappears - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling matches, when they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that in the whole year, we have nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but we have changed our contact with Tackles a real focal point in the last six weeks, and it has done for us, the trend.
Trent is there now for three years, and he obviously has a great team to work out, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how it always reappears at this time of year.
Bellamy has Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and attacked his mentor, recalling that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how her game was exciting, " said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit about shit.
But he now has a team that can play and what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That is the ball game that you play, if you want that type of player.
He made that statement in 2010, now that he wants all of his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I am counting on greater trust, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago they would not have thought of us when it came to the Big Game.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the outcome? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it is the game plan.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a single phase.
The Storm team won this weekend, as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park, the ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
