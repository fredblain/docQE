The Upper Bavarian village is Ramsau near Berchtesgaden, Germany's first "mountaineering village."
From the hand of the vice-president at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig usury, the 1800-inhabitant village in Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for sustainable tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 "mountaineers."
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for the awarding of the prize.
A "village" climber may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its surface area must be designated as a protected area.
