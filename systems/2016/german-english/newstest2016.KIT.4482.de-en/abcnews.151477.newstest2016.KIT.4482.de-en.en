In an emergency, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told a somewhat tremulous voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to stress that his "cute dog" but still live and was probably excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss, a handwritten note that was scrawled on a white block: "I am sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he was shot and killed, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said that his university employees the shooting heard at 10: 18 pm.
He said that Lamb made the fateful call at some point after that.
By the end of the day, there was another death: lamb committed suicide when police surrounded him.
A day after the shootings at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details released by investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what the students and staff who knew him testify, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they were looking forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal record.
Schmidt's Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him, in which he spoke of the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both teach in the department of social sciences and history, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there were some inclines to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously at Delta State University asked for a leave for medical reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard for him, would not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr. Lambs notion."
These are questions that can no longer reply to lamb.
After fleeing the campus police found the Lambs later track, when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested Lamb, killed himself selbstmit a d caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3500 students in a city with about 12000 inhabitants, and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
He was the crowd of women.
All the girls melt away when he was there, " said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obvious for some time.
The emergency call Lamb said: "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which shares a border with a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O ' Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter, who was 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated," said O ' Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O ' Steen said he had never met, but Lamb by his daughter, Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb hit Prentiss, when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer-year market.
They later played together one or two gigs.
O ' Steen, said his daughter, sings and writes her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a low-lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonikaspiel finished a meager audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were in the clean up and joked with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, a dead professor, headed the first-year seminar program, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community in a candle lighting ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, during the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and sang "amazing Grace."
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to encourage our students to go back," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call, after he had shot, Schmidt and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss is referred to as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were ever married.
