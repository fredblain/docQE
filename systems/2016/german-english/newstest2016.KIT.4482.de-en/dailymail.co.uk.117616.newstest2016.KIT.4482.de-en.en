Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven per cent rise in online sales.
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales grew three years ago by the use of mobile phones to shop
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has put the brakes on spending
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales will stagnate, after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year.

"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year, and go back to 2000, it has evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG-sales index.
He said that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started with their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the couch.
But now it is leveling off, and we will probably see that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining revenues.
Experts believe that, buyers keep their purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bargains, and some retailers ' websites plummeted.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers fight for bargains could deter buyers to make purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending by £ 5 a bit more than £ 1 was spent online.
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of purchases are now being carried out on web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chain in the inner cities.
