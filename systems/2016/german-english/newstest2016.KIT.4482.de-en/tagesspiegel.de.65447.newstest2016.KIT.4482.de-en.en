JVA Berlin-Tegel: five-square-metre cell are inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Justice Correctional Institution Tegel, which was right for months, in a small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to monetary compensation if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday.
According to the magistrates, the people affected can even hope to have money if they were just a few days locked up in the tight spaces (Case 1 BvR 1054/01).
It was an ex-prisoner successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Justice Correctional Institution in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with roughly five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not closed off.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer now been released, had been moved to a larger cell.
Although his term failed lawsuit liability because of the substandard conditions of detention against the city of Berlin.
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the court in Berlin and had the case back for reconsideration.
They see the human dignity of the man.
The supreme court will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, from the period in question, only a few days in prison days are crucial for the compensation, whether a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise it would be "a decline in the legal protection of personality."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation money.
The constitutional courts in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
They spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell.
Human habitation is the multiple-occupancy of a cell without a toilet, according to a decision by 2011.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday, the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which was certified in November 2009 a subhuman housing a prisoner in a parallel case.
Then the plaintiff was more than three months between 15 to 21 hours a day in a row, as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons were also in the last couple of weeks in the headlines because of a lack of staff.
That is why prisoners are repeatedly trapped 23 hours, the aggression is rising, even unto blows it should be because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office 21 posts are vacant in Tegel Airport due to lack of talent, 19 out of 2016.
