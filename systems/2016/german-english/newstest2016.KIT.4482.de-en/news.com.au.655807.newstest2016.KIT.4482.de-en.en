The last three agree: the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secrets revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly, apparently, who will win The Bachelor.
The woman, Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally landed, was wrapped in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls certainly will not disclose whether it is the one that has received the final rose.
But when we are with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, the day before from three to two, eincheckten, you may have inadvertently given a hint about who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the finale on Thursday firmly sealed
All three women have turned to lyrical, exuberant about why Wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "if you do not, who should get Wood's final rose?" Their answers could be the spoiler, who won the hearts of the Bachelor's degree.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski cited both quickly - except himself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been from day one, a simple relationship with each other.
"From the moment when I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah) and Sam energies, because I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is with both feet on the ground, there is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel nice and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From their point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now fully adjusted to him," she said.
And when she was asked to choose whom to Wood, if they do not, because it was puzzling.
"I do not know if I can say this," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 19: 30.
