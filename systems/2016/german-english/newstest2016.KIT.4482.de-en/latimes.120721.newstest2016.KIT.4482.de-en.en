FedEx earnings mixed financial-reduced prospects for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said that it plans to hire roughly 55000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trading 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said, to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 $ for the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected, according to a poll by FactSet 10.84 $.
The reduction comes despite the prospect of price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.
The company said that it expects that earnings over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of the growth in online trade will increase.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides "solid returns, given the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire between 90000 and 95000 more workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 $ per share, just behind the $2.44 $ per share, the twelve inquired of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, the turnover in its express delivery unit brought to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, revenue at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In the Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell 3.85, or $2.5 percent, to 150.15 $.
