The Free voters demand the hiring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of high numbers of refugees.
Party and Group chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-autumn exam in large wall city facing a severe crisis of Bavaria's schools when there are new teachers, not for the many new students: "we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to maintain the schools on the brink of collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will have distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Land of the Free voters Group is meeting until Friday in Bavaria in the municipality.
In fact, very different main topics were set aside.
But a record number of refugees now dominates the Free voters meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will superimpose the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN safe zones for refugees in Syria, as they were during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"So it goes no further, we must attend to the causes," said the Free voters head.
Deported asylum seekers want to deport the Free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims: "we need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-chief criticised the fact that several states were not consistently: "we need federal uniform standards throughout the provinces."
"Bavaria pushes off, others do not."
"We need to be more effective."
But the land policy in big city wall did not fall under the table.
A long, long years remains on the agenda: the politics of education.
The new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 Gymnasium the intermediate pilot "plus", in which an extension of the intermediate runs from three to four years will be tested as a result it takes - then again nine years until high school.
But the Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The issue must be accelerated," said the -9 FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for those who want to school.
Free ride in the G9, wherever it wants.
