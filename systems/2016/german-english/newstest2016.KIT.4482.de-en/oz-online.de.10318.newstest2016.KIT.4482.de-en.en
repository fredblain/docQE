For months, was negotiated behind closed doors and pondered and debated.
There are now plans for a new vacation house at the Little Sea near Emden, on the table.
The visitor, the medium-sized Emder enterprise "system-building," said on Monday night in the city development committee of the Emder Council his plans publicly for the first time.
This item originally had been in the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from critics of the project and the FDP group who accuse the investors and the management of secrecy, Ralf Behrends of the system's construction management team on the offensive: "we do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to meet all the rumours now.
The expensive project around 10 to 12 million euros in the discussion for months.
Strong reactions among sea fairground owners, who had come into the meeting, called the images and new details emerged about the desired Hotelbau.
Roberto Schulz, seaside stalls owner and board member at the representation of the interests of riparian, Pro Hieve, complains: "this will be a giant monster, dominated all the other building."
Moreover, he fears, as many other critics of the project, that the traffic would increase sharply by the intended size of the plant: "as a whole Busladung come to, so it makes sense," says Schulz
What exactly happens in the good one-acre grounds of the former pub, however, is still open.
Still, there is no operator.
"We need to have a consistent approach," said Ralf Behrends.
Because of this, the plans are also variable.
