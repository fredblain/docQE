The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, he said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in solid timeframe against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC's Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come into contact with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes or broadcasts, which were also shown clearly by not subsidised rivals," said Johnson, the House of Lords Communication Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, what I believe in the medium or long term is not a good idea, you should at least take his production on programs that others do not make or commission.
They send out The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show that this is a joke, it is ridiculous, of course it is nonsense.
Johnson said: " I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public service television.
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a contractor for the series, led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what was the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes on BBC4 should go, " where one cannot fairly judge the audience, but they can fulfil their tasks, and they argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees, " well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has ever seen. "
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: " I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value here.
Of course, you all think that we all think that for £ 150 per year here gets a great value, but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150, wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform, educate and entertain "."
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take a leaf out of the publicly-owned television stations in Australia and Canada, change it to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, said Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and alliances with the commercial channels, in order to make everything available online.
