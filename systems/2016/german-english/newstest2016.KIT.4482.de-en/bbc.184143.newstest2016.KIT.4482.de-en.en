Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut with the Prime Minister's Question Time awaits with anticipation
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, and probably his performance by the media and the Labour MEPs will be examined closely.
He called for "less theatrical and more facts on this weekly event."
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision by the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, in silence, criticism from a number of Tory MPs has provoked and lies at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they cite differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour "pile up" after Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that presenting Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap as a whole.
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £ 26000 to £ 23000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30000 comments.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he is both "repartee" and refrain from the dispute with barbs and instead has to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will replace him when he is not taking part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also presented the idea that others sometimes take the floor, and that he was John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, raised, in order to discuss the problem.
In 2005, when he was leader, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics in the style of a "Punchinello-Theater," which is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time was seen with the Prime Minister as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, even though critics have argued that it is become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
