UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "there is no military solution" to the conflict lasted nearly five years, and more weapons of violence and misery for millions of people will only make matters worse.
The UN chief again calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member-nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the fringes of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers "this intractable situation."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
