Exceptions to the new Bernrieder sports hall
The Bernried council approved the Bauantrag for EUR 2.3 million in expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof should be flat for the solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau on Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: in the recent City Council meeting, unanimously approved the draft Bauantrag without much debate.
Previously, the board decided, among other things, a request for a baugesetzliche "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" dealt with the permission of a special form on the roof structure.
According to a "roof with non-modified First and roof survives."
Background of the planning is the proper use of the roof space for solar panels: "we have a wonderful big SÃ¼ddach together," mayor Josef Steinberger said in the meeting.
The "liberation", in turn, went to the roof slope, which - unlike in the construction plan prescribed for energy reasons - is less than 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is reduced significantly.
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope does not allow for "exceptions" - and the Bernrieder council in the more restrictive rules on exemption requests.
In the Turnhallenbau, however, it is not a recurring project: "we do not create a precedent," said Steinberger.
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Costs are around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected to come from the school and grassroots sports funding.
In the next procedural step, the Bauantrag will now be submitted to the local Health Authority for consideration for the Hall 18 x 36 metres wide.
