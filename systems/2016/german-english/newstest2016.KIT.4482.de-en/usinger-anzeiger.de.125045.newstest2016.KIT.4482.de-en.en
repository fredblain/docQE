No diet-fruit - mangoes contain lots of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But who wants to take care of his slim line, which is often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain relatively high sugar sucrose - above all.
The healthy exotic fruits are nonetheless: they are stuck in B-vitamins, vitamins E and C. In particular mangoes contain much vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Anyone who eats the fruit, thus supports vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
Buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smelling.
The shell color alone says nothing about how the fruit is ripe, green mangoes also can taste delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and eat within a few days.
Then, of course, they tasted neat or in sweet dishes.
There is a mango but also hearty dishes.
They soften the bitter taste of some green salads, such as chicory and Radiccio.
And a Mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and venison.
