Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way, about how important good nutrition while breastfeeding is. It is doing so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on her breasts, which are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates to give the babies all the nutrients they need in order to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet can have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
