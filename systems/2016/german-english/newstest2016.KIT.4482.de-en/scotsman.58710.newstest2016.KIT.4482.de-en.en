Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while it is rising in the United Kingdom as a whole.
The unemployment rate in Scotland has remained in the period from May to July, unchanged at 164000, while the number of people out of work for the UK as a whole during the same period rose by 10000 to 1.82 million.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9 percent higher than that of the UKs 5.5 percent, as the figures from the Office for National Statistics (ons).
In the meantime, the employment in Scotland fell by 12000 during the three months now, with the number of workers in 2 612000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell during the quarter to 74.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said the latest figures and said: "the long-term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In those 12 months we have seen further improvement in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate.
