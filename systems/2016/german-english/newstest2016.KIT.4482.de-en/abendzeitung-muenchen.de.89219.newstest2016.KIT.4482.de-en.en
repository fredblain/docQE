Munich, Germany, the island of Sylt and Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex, overlooking the North Sea.
In the street, a square metre costs a Reetdachhauses averaged 73300 euros.
"On the island of Sylt is inherently limited," the range of objects, it says in the study - so the high price.
A new study shows what particular locations in a square metre costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euro per square metre for a student room in Munich is not really enough.
In contrast to Germany's top residential places comes a price but still peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations, with land prices in dizzy heights.
There are tens of thousands of euros - nix per square metre, mind you.
But anyway, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is here for once, not even at the top.
