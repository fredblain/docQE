David Cameron certainly knows better, The Lorax?
It is one thing all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless perhaps you are David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr Seuss graced.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "funny, emotional, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details, in order to expand the original text is rather short.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest was Dr. Seuss graced, whose real name was Theodor Seuss graced hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text proposed by Cameron reads in part, as the summary of the Lorax-film, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is the plot of the book is so unfamiliar, here is an unnamed boy listens, as the local environment by the money-grabbing fourth guessing, trees, Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name Lorax, a huddled, his essence, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
It was highly likely that such a relatively low PR task delegated to a worker who has read The Lorax not 20 times in a row, to a child.
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but there was no further immediate comment.
