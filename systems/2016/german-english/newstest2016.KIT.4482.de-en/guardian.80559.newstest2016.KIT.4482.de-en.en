Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's squad, but it is still difficult to
In the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan, is a difficult task, but if you have selected the squad, England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less than three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting position, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars of 2012, only a youthful, positive attitude.
With the ball develops Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for the attack.
This related news: Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, for me, as his head coach, in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There was no question mark when Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this earlier - players are their own best chooser.
Long ago we could have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if it is not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth had seven opportunities - such as Sam Robson - in front of him, while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism one can gather, was that England was Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean began - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a man who shot, which I appreciate.
He is an X-factor-cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which hit us very much.
He must be at least given the same opportunities as those in front of him, but, of course, this depends on the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen in addition to Cook, which would receive an extra spin Bowler and four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man can't beat, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a hell of a guy of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is not a number 3 for them, and there is no difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played in his first 38 tests at first drop, before he emerged in 2001 as an opener.
He has managed three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari is in the squad as a back-up spinner, and he has impressed me as a young man in my limited dealings with him.
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinner who raise their hands, and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the trial games could be a champion.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, because he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood is coming to the white ball-stage of the Tour and brings energy and a strong commitment to the environment.
I have always felt that he is created for international cricket competition as a player or a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices in the dressing room bring a breath of fresh air, even if the messages are consistent with the above.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some people will not agree, but coaches and Teamaufsteller do not determine the timetable.
And you must bear in mind that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are taken not blithely.
