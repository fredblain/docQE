Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German involvement in Syria in a way.
"I believe that the firm thinking about military options for action must not be allowed to take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the "collective European nations of turning a blind eye."
Four years ago, it was pleased that the chalice of military involvement in Germany is over.
"Now, the conflict ends up crashing on our doorstep," he said in Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington, also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
