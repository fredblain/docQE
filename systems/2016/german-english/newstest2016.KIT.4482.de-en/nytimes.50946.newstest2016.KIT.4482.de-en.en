4 people were killed after police fire rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of people who marched against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and fired into the air before they returned to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, which are known, that they can kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution that would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since 10.
Killed in August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution, but it is a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has for centuries been governed centrally.
The work on a new constitution is on the road since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April, thousands of people have been killed.
The lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new Constitution could come into force on Sunday.
