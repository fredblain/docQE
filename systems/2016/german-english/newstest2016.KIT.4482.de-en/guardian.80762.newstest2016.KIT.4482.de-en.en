Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
Shame the UK's advertising arms trade
Amnesty International's anti-arms trade shows-video.
Horrible killer-drone!!!
Ankle-smashing leg shackles!!!
Cluster bombs!!!
And electric shock sticks, causing agonising pain, but leave no trace behind.
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this display for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the British government's willingness to bring the spotlight to sold arms to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains, which require a second look.
"Important notice: go from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) you read in the characters of the London Underground and the DLR's trademark line, which converts the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the Arms Fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for cruel designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A group called the Special Patrol Group, helped in the distribution in London and used "ad Space Hack Packs", a £ 6-pack of Inbusschlüsseln, from which it is claimed that "access to about a third of the bus-advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London this Plakatier- "vandalism" is not funny.
One of the parody ads, was produced by the Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries.
Many artists do with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms-trade-posters greet commuters on the tube.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit works with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP-creative director Matt Lever was surprised by the silence that prevailed around the advertising of the arms fair - by a space of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "we are giving them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a realistic shady corporate advertising, but it remains more liable "by the Einbläuen with bright colors and animation."
"You have done a fantastic job, by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the show," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices will not be illegally traded on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors euphemistic fantastic products sold off.
In a press release Saab revealed a mission of the US Army on "the RS downed AT4CS from the shoulder."
These include a "uniquely shaped warhead, the prominent Nachwirkungs effects inside the goal."
Whatever the causes, it will not be pleasant.
