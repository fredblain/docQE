Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss-surgery or obesity-surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proved effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

Used for the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare the two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sleeve education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
In the meantime, the BMI is among those who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes, roughly the same at 29.
Among those who have undergone surgery, broke free at 36% of the diabetes disease completely and at 28%.
Sparked in the medically treated group compared to the diabetes fully only at 1% and sometimes at only about two percent.
In addition, the results were at the controls of the blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol, "are generally better in the ' surgical ' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average decreased hemoglobin A1c levels of around 9 per cent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But these "better glycemic control" - like you - reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels reduced the mortality rate in five years, then the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more experienced a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study of surgery, no survival advantage after five years shows that there is hard evidence from a study of people in Sweden, that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who undergo obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study does not advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously the weight as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we have to wait long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes, which have their bodies connected with obesity and diabetes, is really hard to reverse. "
