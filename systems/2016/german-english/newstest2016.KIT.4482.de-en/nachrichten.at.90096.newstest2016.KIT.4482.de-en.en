Now that Viktor Orbán several more thousand sends to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately to assist in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of Nazism.
Victims of this policy are not only those Austrians, who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
The Geflüchtete will also have to conclude that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the onset of winter, in decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be even greater - peace, security and stability in Austria.
