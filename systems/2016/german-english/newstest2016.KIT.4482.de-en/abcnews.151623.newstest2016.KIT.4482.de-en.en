8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to take Donald Trump from the upper echelons in the polls, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in double digits, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously, what does it mean for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one contends that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership on the rising Herman Cain was made, none of which has only won one state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to topple him.
Here are some of the latest poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase.
Trump's popularity ratings have been rotated by 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a real-estate mogul.
There were 40 per cent by mid-July.
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And keep these numbers in early states.
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with GOP candidates as Trump.
Last week, in a poll conducted by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 saying they were "upset" if he were the nominee.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "thrilled" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters leaning to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same is true in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they keep their hats to scholars Trump, Republican voters for real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week, four out of ten, that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clear crystal globe in the past.
At this time last cycle, four out of ten Republicans, Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% of the final candidate Mitt Romney.
However, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign, viewed as a plausible.
Even if the Republicans are gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump's support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
He has Carly Fiorina 13-point lead before Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and, finally, from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A narrow majority of Donald Trump's fans say that they have formed their opinions.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have lost their voices.
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, the view never changes.
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to other candidates.
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions, are twice as often for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration.
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" that immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic language critical of Trump Hispanic-Americans will stay away from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs's efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems to be Donald Trump.
The frustration over the government climbed to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, now accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters, particularly by their outsider status.
Six of 10 Republicans say the new Monday-ABC/Post, they would rather have a political outsider, as someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three out of four of Iowa's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "hellish angry."
