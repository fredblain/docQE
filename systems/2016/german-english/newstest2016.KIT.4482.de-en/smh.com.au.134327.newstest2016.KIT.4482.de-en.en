Peter Moody claimed that Steward tried to spy on him and threatened to quit the sport
Peter Moody claimed that Steward of Racing Victoria have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately.
It was aimed at the Steward and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day-treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what is best for the sport and he found himself in difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt-swab sample in Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had 18 months ago because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say about this, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
This evening, I will go home and sleep well.
I want to walk around with your head, and I would like to see my owners think that I try my best for them.
If they start to think, I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with state-racing.com, that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey sat, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart - in a room with a man - whom I shall name when I am asked and offered him a job in my stables for information about what I am doing in my stables to deliver," said Moody on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly look at their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware at the time and there are still today.
Should get me to believe that it will be personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and maybe makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
I feel so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there.
Perhaps they need to take my license and me, and I have no doubt that what I say, you can now think about it.
But I am now at a point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustrations-levels of coaches have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation in Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day-treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horses legs, which contravened the rules.
" It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this, " he said.
" One of my employees has mistakenly sprayed slurry on the leg.
It could have been yesterday evening.
It could have been all day yesterday, so what was the case.
It was also on the day of the race.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on the day of the race, an investigation of this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who set these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all recognize that we need rules, but here, it is gone too far," said Moody.
