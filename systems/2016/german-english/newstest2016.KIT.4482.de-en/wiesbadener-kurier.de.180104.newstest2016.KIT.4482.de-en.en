Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the accident
The head of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye, according to several reports, by a crash at the beginning of July.
In the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the US, he had died after midnight on a water glass, which he had worn in the left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reporting on Wednesday.
"He is bleeding to death, was almost powerless, then dragged out into the street - that he has told us so, last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could look into his work.
"At the beginning of October, we gather in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager and was "fully operational" at the meeting.
McDermott announced in an interview with the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung (Thursday edition) that he will come back to Germany in October and continue with the software company.
"I am totally there for SAP, in my job."
"Of course, the whole time I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner," McDermott said the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung".
McDermott typically fluctuates between Germany and the US, but since the summer, he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important to him, to go with such a personal story to the public, said the manager of the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung": "any such a thing can happen."
"It is important to stand up again, if you fall off."
