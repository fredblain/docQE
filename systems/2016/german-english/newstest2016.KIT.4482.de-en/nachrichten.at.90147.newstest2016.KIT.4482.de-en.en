The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The major overhaul of the "new" industrial yard line in the Linz is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building is leased to the Stock Exchange listed IT company, S & T, the rest (2700 square meters) to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"In IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we have to try that they work for us," says S & T's chief Hannes Lower Hauser.
He could imagine to invest in startup companies in the New Shipyard and later to acquire any.
From the very beginning, S & T intends to cooperate with the new neighbors - a Lower Hauser promises: "the next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
EUR 1.7 million has been invested by S & T in the base 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, Upper Austria and the Federal (FFG).
The building is leased by the Linz AG for 60 years, S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of the 2700 square metre rest area in the building are rented, there are questions for another 40 percent.
