' Sonogenetics ' brain cells can be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically-modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sonic pulses for human hearing at high frequencies, in order to be heard.
The impetus to work through the activation of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels, which react to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said that the worm showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The blisters, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves on structures, the TRP-4 called ion channels, and found some of the worms in the cell membranes.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, as a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes, genetically-modified Chalasani wear the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the Mikrobl√§schen and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a cutting-edge tool that allows scientists to neurons with pulses of light and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technology.
In contrast to the light that revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain has to be low-frequency ultrasound waves unimpeded tissue and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the angezielt human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
