Rent-440-horsepower sports car and drive to scrap
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and borrow from a Ford Mustang.
Then came the wake up on the rain-wet highway.
In a factory in the district of Gotha, one can fulfill the dream and even hire and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
It was also a 29-year-old from the rural district of Gotha.
On A 71 in Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, fell on a wet roadway into a tailspin and raced into the corridor.
The sports car was destroyed, but no one was injured.
The material damage is estimated at EUR 40000.
