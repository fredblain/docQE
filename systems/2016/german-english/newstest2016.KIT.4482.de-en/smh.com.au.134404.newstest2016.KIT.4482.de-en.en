Serbians with a $200000 bail after drug charge
A man who may be a life sentence because of his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled to Queensland, was released on bail of $200000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police 100 kg of the drug was on the yacht Solay, which came from South America across Vanuatu and in August in Coomera.
Maksimovic was observed how he met his co in the marina during the morning and later in the Caf√© Coomera Roadhouse, where police seized 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksimovic, argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the whole lot and that may have been in the cafe of a benign reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of absconding in Maksimovic.
He has clear ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, " he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had jointly offered a deposit of $200000 as a security in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the statutory declaration statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200000 a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him, not to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he will make his Australian and his Serbian passport, is reported to the police daily and abide by a curfew from 18: 00 until 06: 00.
