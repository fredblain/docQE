Hoyerswerda: small life assistance for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
A warm welcome to you, is not possible without the dedication of countless volunteer helpers.
Also in Hoyerswerda, there is a whole raft of people who support altruistic asylum-seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is body and soul with a teacher.
Also, with their 74 Lenzen, she still teaches.
Every Thursday, they do it in the asylum-seekers home to the Dillinger road.
There, they help refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan, to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from teaching at a school right.
