Stars who have lost their mojo
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his long-time partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All of this certainly exacts its toll.
