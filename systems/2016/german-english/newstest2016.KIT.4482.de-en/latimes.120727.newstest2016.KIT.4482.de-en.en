At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming above them at one end of the ornate two-storey sitting room wall is a picture of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximise the US employment and keep prices stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate of the X-factor could be in a decision that is too narrow to predict them. It will be announced on Thursday that if the US economy is ready to start from the unprecedented stimulus by the underlying short-term interest rates close to zero since the end of 2008 to be weaned.
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate on government bonds, and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what in themselves the financial market.
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have this week predicted an increase in interest rates.
The financial markets, however, expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance of a hike.
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rate, except that the strategists softened the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 228.89 points, or 1.4%.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point, " he said.
If they do it, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said during the spring and the summer that they would be required this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress, expect an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that the Fed sees as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation has been consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
"The economy can sustain higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world begin to twitch at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16% from its highs, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curtail global growth.
The market has rebounded slightly this month, with the Dow now at almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives influence the market turmoil of the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not have emerged over the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would tighten the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
He now predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.
"There are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it technically should not be involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could tighten its monetary expansion "," triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
"Their decision-making is more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management firm Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for an increase in interest rates, cited decisions over the years, as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should only aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse first, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the interest-rate setting Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"They certainly do not want to fall into the situation, in which she has fear of a rate increase, because the markets are excited," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should jump ahead of the time.
