Pegida brings Lebanese poster to Kartoffeldöner idea
Potatoes or Döner?
It is both - and in the Kartoffeldöner has developed the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the slogan "potatoes rather than döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement has Alhay potatoes and meat on a skewer.
The idea made him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on television.
Since then, his shop is in a Grillspieß, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multicultural in the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now joined the Lebanese in the Patent Office in Munich.
There, it is protected, according to the agency as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes contain the skewer, Alhay not betrayed.
Just as much: "it tastes even better together," he finds it.
The culinary world understanding well even among his customers.
