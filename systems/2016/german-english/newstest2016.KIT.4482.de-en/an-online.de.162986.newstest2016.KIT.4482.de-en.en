EU Commission proposes in row over new court TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned trans-Atlantic free trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration institutions for resolving disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is far more traditional in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system, the trust of the citizens," declared the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch.
The Swede has, to put forward the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.

It would make it possible to collect judgments against the opposition.
So far, the procedures involved with each other on the referee, it was not an appeal against their sentences.
In the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice are not trusted, Malmström said.
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court according to their own.
There could then be addressed, for example, also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
In particular, required by large corporations, investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is considered one of the main reasons for the huge resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, on the corporate compensation at the expense of the taxpayer can wrest, national laws to nullify or a lowering of consumer protection and environmental standards.
In early statements anti-TTIP organizations like Campact described the proposals by the EU Commission as inadequate.
It was criticized, in particular, that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German economy Staatssekretär Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission has taken into account in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel is working with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.

In particular, small and medium-sized businesses could be adversely affected, it said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed on Wednesday, remained unclear.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of protection of investors, however, has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Originally, there should be a framework for the agreement as early as the end of this year.
This date is regarded as no longer tenable.
