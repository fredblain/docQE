Hundreds of Muslims gathered, when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mecca Grand Mosque.
Grieving, largely filled up dressed in white, the route to pay their respects, as the first of the dead begin their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The funeral procession moved over to the holy site, where only days before a crane through the roof of the mosque and then rushed to the prayer.
The bodies were released to the funeral, when the Saudi king Bin Laden because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured, a sanction imposed on the builders of the family.
The bodies of 29 beter, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage, when the crane crashed down.
Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Grand Mosque.
Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city, will continue.
Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden group would not leave the arm of a crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency reported that detail, but said that the leadership of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that collapsed in a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims from the Hajj pilgrimage, which takes place later this month, gathered.
The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the crane collapse, and their representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also chided the group not because of current security measures and because they have not partnered with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project, which is led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family is linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and assumes larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, who in the 1990s was disowned by the family.
The crash of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the UK for the pilgrimage at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim is required.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials are ordered to pay 1 million rial (Â£ 174000) to the families of the deceased is the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injuries will receive half of that amount.
