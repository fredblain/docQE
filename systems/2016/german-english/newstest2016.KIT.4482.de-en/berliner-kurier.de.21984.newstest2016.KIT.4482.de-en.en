Justin Bieber in the capital: Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, megastar.
A mere 21 years old, a HÃ¤nfling with oberschicker Frise.
The guy with the platinum-blonde hair is EUR 100 million.
Rather, even more.
Is Monsieur Bieber currently in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 rotates.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton."
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7.00 a.m., however, the Pole is sitting on the cold stone slabs from a luxury hotel in Berlin at the Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-construction: it is her idol, whose poster hung in Szczecin, herded together since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer, lives on the same day costs as much as her mum Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
The says: "actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth grade in high school."
"I am fulfilling a dream."
Compulsory education?
Who itches?
Not the fans.
Even Bieber himself does not.
The already is outdated now.
He earn three million for advertising during the commercial break of the Superbowls, a two-year deal with an anti-pimple-company washed many, many dollars at Bieber's account.
And for every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also collects.
If Justin Bieber is drinking a coffee, you marvel at the windowpane.
More than 100 million he is supposed to have.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is currently in the US and Britain with his new single "what do you mean?" To Number 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due in November, follow the many zeros not interested.
At least that way he does.
