EU plans to double the mercury limit in carnivorous fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and thus consumers expect a significantly higher doses of the nerve toxin.
The consumer organization Food Watch, which is before a proper working paper from the EU, harshly criticised the plans: "the risks and side effects missed industrial and environmental policies are passed by the full force of pregnant women and infants," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch.
According to Wolf Schmidt should be raised to the limits of the nerve toxin for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the current limits, around 50% of the catch may not be sold.
After doubling the limit would then be just 14.5 percent unsold.
In exchange for the easing of the EU, according to Food Watch wants the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of mercury to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram.
Food Watch but described it as a "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually so low, that they should stick to the planned limits already.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction, that alone helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal is highly toxic to humans, which accumulate through the food chain, especially in carnivorous fish.
That is why the Federal Government warns that "very small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system of unborn children."
The German Federal Ministry of Environment said on its website in relation to the current maximum levels but that a "health risk to the general population" was not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly through the burning of coal into the environment.
The German coal-fired power plants emit, according to a written disclosure of the Ministry of Environment, the Green MP Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount of emissions in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish in roughly the same, the Rhine and the Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded," the "mirror" was quoted in the paper in March.
Last year Europe-wide included warnings about mercury in fish are already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
