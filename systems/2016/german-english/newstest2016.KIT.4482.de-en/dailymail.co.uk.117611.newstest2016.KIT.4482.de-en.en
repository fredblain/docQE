BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham

He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The Brit

BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and new increased pressure on the broadcaster, to prove that he does something that the private sector do not.
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly impossible to distinguish from its commercial counterparts.
"Seems to be Radio 3 - I use the word" verdummen "does not like to - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM," he said.
It also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which began last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appears only at The Brit to be under a different name.
So, if you try to do something different - these are spontaneously mentioned two examples where you actually just mimic what is already on the market, " said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I am going anywhere else to learn about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and new works in order to give, I feel really important," he said.
Earlier this year argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan initally composed using Davey that it should be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing at the Committee for the selection of Culture, Media and Sport to commercial rivals on the toes.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent of the BBC show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds.
You will see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC-produced" way.
He added that he hoped that the company "a hit in our own barn find," if it is the next time you start a conversation.
However, he refused to rule out the purchase of a further series of The Voice in the future or money from the fee payers to spend on other entertainment formats.
