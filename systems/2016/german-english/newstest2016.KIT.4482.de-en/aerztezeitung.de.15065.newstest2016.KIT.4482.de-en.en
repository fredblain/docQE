Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes, thus not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news: the risk of abandonment is declining quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam, Germany.
Compared to non-smokers, in smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23300 subscribers.
The main causes of tooth loss are cavities and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE.
For these periodontitis is smoking a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss, therefore, go to frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
Is not clear the extent to which smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years, until the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham England.
We need to convince people, to be non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "smoking shortens life."
Smoking is not good for lungs and blood vessels and leads to an old age, according to our findings, even on a good dental health.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population are affected by loss of teeth at the age of 65 to 74 years, divided the DIfE.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long-term study confirm the findings.
