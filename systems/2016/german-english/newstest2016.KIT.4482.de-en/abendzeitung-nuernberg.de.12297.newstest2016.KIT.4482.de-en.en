Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and idol
Two scorers in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Mueller has just one run.
A lucky strike by Thomas Müller's FC Bayern paved the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze in the cauldron of Piraeus had a dream start in the "mission" of the FC Bayern.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Mueller double Pack (52/90 + 2) and Götzes hits (earned), with 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth home success in the series will be the first step towards final on May 28, 2016, in Italy, where Guardiola at the third attempt to finally bring the Henkel Potts to Munich.
Mueller got his 28th goal in the Champions League to Bayern's benevolent assistance of Olympiakos's goalkeeper Roberto, who had a shot intended as a flank of the World Cup.
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria's captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31688 capture fans - and the thought of Munich.
They showed a focussed and committed performance, without having to shine.
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus.
2011 stumbled here also Borussia Dortmund (1-3).
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They were brave, but ran in their offensive efforts often unimaginative to work.
The attacks were often initiated by game shift to external links, Douglas Costa, who opposed the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui rarely occurred.
Müller had more luck on the right when his flank from the right mid-field in the top left Toreck.
In the 66th minute, the world champion of the possible 2-0.
The best times in one half had Robert Lewandowski.
First of all, when Olympiakos-striker Ideye Brown, the head of the ball, beat Poland from the line (26).
Then, by direct inspection, the goalkeeper parried Roberto with the knee (35th).
Although the Bayern used to affix their dominant game, Piraeus needle stitches.
At goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was our bond.
For example, when he took a shot of Ideye on the Latte (56th).
Before Guardiola re-erected a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre of defence alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Goetze, according to muskulären problems back in the squad, was sitting outside.
The World Cup hero was only after the completion of training given the green light, said member Matthias Sammer in "sky": "anyone who wants to make something different out of it, that is evil."
At the first change of Guardiola also decided against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman for beleaguered Lewandowski (59th).
Goetze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later, everything was clear, via penalty, Müller.
Before the game, it was in the stadium riot.
After a smaller group of partially masked and Bayern fans in their viewers-block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went in with batons against the Munich-based supporters.
At least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium.
