This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming, and the bull market will falter, yields on bonds will rise and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long all this and how long it will continue.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end.
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how to respond to the economy and the financial assets.
Therefore, representatives of the Federal Reserve have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is necessary for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end of the market participants, however, may find that the outburst may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level, in order to lead to a seismic shock that many appear to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look at historical trends based on how some parts of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems to me that there is a tendency that asset returns will choke off 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to interest rate hikes by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is pretty flat over the past 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates, then the 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of return over the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the cycle and increase the rate of return that is beginning to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
Most remarkable is that the GDP will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank was among the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950, the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and we expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of whether "this time it is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Participants in the market throughout the year have been caught on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC might approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in terms of GDP and the pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows," says the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in stocks, though the change its strategic direction.
The returns on bonds seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, increasing bond yields will fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab, believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer to one another and lead to a tailing off of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often yield better returns, even though "we still are cautious to expect higher returns in such a climate," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US, stands to benefit if interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as the financing of its debt.
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively, three months after an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the client.
Companies with strong balance-sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their stocks outperform their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high degree of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of the pure stock of games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts are divided on how quickly this will take place.
