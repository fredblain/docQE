The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers "could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could affect the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and this could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
