Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tight.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
The fights on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens in the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, need to be built by 2020, every year, 400000 new units.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Associations Alliance ' social housing '.
For comparison, this year will be held in Germany to 260000 units.
Thus missing 140000 homes.
Refugees are no longer obligated to the first three months of their stay to live in a reception as accommodation for asylum seekers.
Many then come across the housing market and in the long queues at a rental apartment.
The German Federal Statistical Office states, however, lived in the last year, less than half of all asylum-seekers.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only because of the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also draws significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany is pushing a housing deficit, which grows from year to year.
Currently lacking in the conurbations around 770000 units, Matthias GÃ¼nther complained, author of the study.
Many workers lived in big cities are inevitably in WG-rooms.
Young adults were involuntary because of the downturn in the housing market in the longer "hotel Mama."
In the big cities, the number of square metres per head for the first time in recent years has fallen again.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance of "social housing" suggests a fresh start.
With new incentives to boost social housing.
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and the property taxes on a temporary basis for subsidised housing.
Moreover, according to alliance of attractive tax relief are needed.
The support programme for refugee accommodation of state bank KfW plays well in cities and towns already.
A good week after the start was already more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now, the project could even be increased.
