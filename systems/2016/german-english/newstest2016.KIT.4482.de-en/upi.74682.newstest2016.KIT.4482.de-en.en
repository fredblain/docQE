' American Ninja Warrior ' first champion crowned
Professional climbers and user help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete, who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and the Grand Prize of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never seen a contest participants, all of the stages of his obstacle course.
During the Saisonfinale were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, down to the final.
The last task was climbing on a 75-foot-long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, and he was the first athlete to complete the grueling phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but finished Caldiero this challenge three full seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after a hard-fought victory, still reeling from the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I have never earned more than $10000, or had to live," said Isaac E! About his piles of money.
All of a sudden.. I still can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, even though he was the first ever ended the sequence that does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changes, he gets great gratification.
I do not believe that he harbors any resentment about that.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Mass of awards he has received from fans.
He is a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "if I had to be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for another season, eight of the filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
