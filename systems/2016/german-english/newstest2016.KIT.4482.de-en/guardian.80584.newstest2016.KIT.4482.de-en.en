Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by criticizing the evidence used in her report on e-cigarettes from Public Health England (PHE).
PHE published the "principle" report last month, and describes him as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the strength of the data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the basis of "very windy," founded on the PHE his main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations are based on "stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape Motherwell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE, that "the current best estimate is that around 95% of e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, previously the managing director of British American Tobacco (BAT) have asked for an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT in a sustainability report to public health, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to receive funds from a e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding, which he previously reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which are also an industry funding provided in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco industry led by PHE.
The research work of the group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape.
However, none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that "so far, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that it was already responding to the claims of BMJ.
He said: "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
One in two life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes, in comparison, are small, but we have to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2 billion per year.
Through the clear presentation of the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.
