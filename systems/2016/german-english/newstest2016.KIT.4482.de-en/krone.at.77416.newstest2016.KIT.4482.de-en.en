But it is also clear that "we need clear signals," said the minister.
The people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration, not even on the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It takes a controlled approach.
Croatia, Slovenia is considering "corridor" - denied
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw this Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana, though.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister emphasised, Slovenia wants to seal its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member must complete its obligations, otherwise the system would not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday, entering the Eastern border crossing Tovarnik/sid to evade the registration.
The Croatian police could pick up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media ever since meeting in the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees.
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also, rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.

Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serb told media on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was to advise the people to take certain routes: "neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus carrying around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, other coaches would be expected.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 km away from Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so we told the police that we have to come here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
So that it could actually get to the observers already predicted shift in the current Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a stretch a little further to the west.
Croatia: "comprehensive ways to border control"
Croatia's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a large influx of refugees on plans for possible emergency situations.
He mentioned details, but he pointed out that Croatia was a non-Schengen member "comprehensive options for border control."
Consider strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia is one of this since 2007, the EU's partner since the country is consistently a testimonial as to the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side, behind the Hungarian border fence remains around 300 refugees.
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the previous night at the border Horgos to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure Mittwochfrüh for a look at what is happening in Horgos: he does not think that the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
Currently, it would not be very large numbers of refugees.
They could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Rates of immigrant workers to dangerous - alternative routes -
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, where alternative routes are drawn in through Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war, Croatia still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers was sent into the border region.
