Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "we are creating the"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What will come to Germany?
Around 800000 asylum-seekers are coming to predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany, according to the Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) in Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that, and we do it."
What is coming to Germany, gives the following overview.
Needed for different forecasts of between 350000 (estimate of the Bundesbauministerien) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously built homes (250000).
Dramatically, is the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties fall: 60000-80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments are also applying for refugees.
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore, wants to double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80000 social housing per year and would have to invest for the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists are in agreement and Bundesbauministerin that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, is the assumption that 55% of the Geflüchtete in Germany can be employed in the long run.
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticized Claudia Walters, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
The integration of refugees is crucial, but whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation of the host society, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrant population migration, says researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a political turning point, according to Thränhardt: the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of the work.
While there has been a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society - is also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view that refugees should be allowed the faster access to the labour market.
A big hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient number of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that most jobs through personal contacts.
The construction of networks therefore believes is the royal road to work integrating Thränhardt.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to the Kita, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "for the displaced parents, it is very important to keep the family together," said Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
Nevertheless, the family of the benefits of Kita, to convince the administration distributed hand slips into different languages.
Should greatly increase the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.
In the countries students are prepared for the classroom without knowledge of German in welcome.
But they are not always informed by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school of administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or Geduldete study - the only exception has been Berlin Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU), but now has abandoned its position.
Studierwillige!Studierwilligen refugees could facilitate the access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence or outsourcing, no tolerance for the asylum seekers more power when they begin their studies.
The latter have basically no Bafög, because they do not fall within the circle of bafögberechtigten people.
Tolerated refugees have so far lived in Germany for four years, in order to be entitled Bafög, from 1 January 2016 to shorten this period to 15 months.
But this funding gap must be closed, Steffen call noise, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should be given immediate Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should Islam gradually give the same rights as you have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship develop.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, a professional to take care of the newcomers.
The rights include duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control.
It also includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany have "forfeited their right to live in Germany," he said at the Bayerische Rundfunk.
He suggested that the Basic Law to be translated into Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more so than today, to be an issue for society as a whole.
It will also have to change the majority society, more pressing, the elimination of discrimination and racism.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it very slowly learns how the NSU-murder series showed that the police and authorities have systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: what immigrant organizations and interest groups do not need white Germans have been demanding and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany commit to remain peacefully in the next few years if the country and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
Germany in general is able to supply the refugees so far expected medical doctors, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As regards Man- power and capacity, we create," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, this extra money needs to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery, calls for all comers in health registration cards.
Services rendered could later be charged with the federal states.
And in the long term it is highly questionable, so many people being fobbed off with limited capacity, the catalogue of the asylum seekers ' performance.
Otherwise, make the doctors above all to create the language barriers.
Until now, Berlin has shown health scientist Thea board, migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, in doctors ' offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted, calls for it.
Would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency room.
And with another diagnostic.
For example, among refugee children there are considerably more unprocessed disability, and the young people it is about HIV awareness.
With the other partial symptoms German doctors came forth from their training but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis infections are not so difficult to see." And as for the shortage of doctors, perhaps even by the refugees, relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be permitted, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the German psycho therapists chamber (BPtK) insane: most are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child trauma arrives in Germany.
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder is unwell, among other things, on so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation, and fears of death.
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration, strong Schreckhaftigkeit and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms of chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees a psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services make an application for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually lasts several months.
In addition to the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
