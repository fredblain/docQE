The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain's exit from the EU) could win, if the economy is in a slump until the year 2017 device
David Cameron's ill-thought-out Neuverhandlungs Strategy, in order to keep Britain in the EU, will be deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "it is yes or no?" Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC, because Europe is fiercely divided on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states that are so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, it is now, and not always from their own guilt, Britain's self-created agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which they mostly do not want to.
In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may, if they do not jeopardize the social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photograph of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.
It is always about me.
My European friend who wants an outside-looking Britain inside the EU tent - "let us not only with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, as happened with the overly long Ausharrende like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, a left-wing Spain.
It is hard to imagine that they will pull a leg to help the Selfie-Brits whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want to, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So maybe some even planning such ministers deliberately unhelpful comments, quite the SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the process of Brexit, my friend.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "the UK has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of press barons, as they have during the referendum in 1975, inspired by Tony Benn but were not supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can be weak recall Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist, who has made a name for himself as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all its craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
A Medley of tax-fearing-rogues, phone-hacked foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought much about it, but found that, if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distributed bananas to distract him, rather than to his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum, because Blair was the principle on which the EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, he opened a back door.
He has never forgiven the press.
But to me the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who in Westminster on Monday gave a friendly pat on the back - I told him that he needs to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy in the 80's, then and now is a mistake.
It can take time, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he has left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am - it is in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-trend and the wild climes of young Tory Engländerismus everyone can probably say yes.
That is what Hilary said "a Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week, when the Scouts fought in it, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father is on television trying to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and his Kabinettsjob to lose.
Hilarys struggle was still attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his supporters and members at its closing session on Monday evening, according to all reports.
Whatever the rührselig bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news-discipline remains in the era of TV around the clock, important and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is true that Cameron is not a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguity to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC will start a campaign for secession - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try to find at home, in particular, a sense of their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin, wasting political capital - they have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the lack of military service in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, I was reminded at the launch on Monday of what is called British Influence Security Forum.
