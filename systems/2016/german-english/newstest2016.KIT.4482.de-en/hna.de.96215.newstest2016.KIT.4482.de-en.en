Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "not only need Wohnhraum refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I am showing how you can still build cheap and good," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees are piling into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Mark Gildner believes to know how rapidly cheaper housing can be built: it builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are piling into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: the mass housing in containers or gym has no sustainability.
For the people to remain a big part here.
Given the influx of refugees, we will need enough housing in the next couple of decades.
A very banal, three-storey townhouse is the solution.
Gildner: a terraced house requires less space.
It facilitates the integration.
It is different if you accommodate people in apartment buildings.
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum-seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, one bath, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say again, there is peace, I will go back.
Then the houses can be easily rearranged to suit the requirements.
What are the costs?
Gildner: the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184000 euros, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Six months of construction has lasted.
This is a good thing.
The building codes have complicated their plans?
Gildner: I was planning my project properly.
Particularly difficult, it always makes the looming sword of Damocles Sonderbau and parking regulations.
Creepy.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house of three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is that they have the space.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the locals react to her townhouse project?
Gildner: there were those who have accused me of creating luxury premises for asylum-seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But you do not tighten up the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: but it is true: we had a building boom over the last five years in Germany, but were built luxury homes that can afford a little more.
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing.
Not just refugees, but also the single mother, or the low paid.
I will show how you can still build cheap and good.
That is what it is about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses.
