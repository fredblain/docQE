Detroit Tigers crept past the Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis-The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.

It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong," said Simon.
It is hard to throw in the Bullpen each game, and that is why I want to be very concentrated in the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter, Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game by Martinez ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.

He looked good at the drums training), looked much better in the Bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the background at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.

The Tigers made three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been removed from the injured list before the game, after he had been missing because of a back suffering more than a month.
