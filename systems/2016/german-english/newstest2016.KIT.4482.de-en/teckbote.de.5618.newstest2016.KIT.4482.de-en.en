Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging of "passion" of the Circus, Dean draws on the traditions of the circus arts.
The goal is to attract people of all ages in the thrall of amazing acrobatics, Tierdressur and unparalleled entertainment.
Now the circus invites Dean in the riding school on the tile-Hans√°g dreaming.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Dean, animal teacher and junior officer.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current staging manege.
For more than 33 years, the Circus is in the hands of the family of Dean.
The gift to the Begeistern family is therefore in the blood.
"It is important to us, the people of their daily routine and herded them along for two hours in a completely different world," said the 27-year-old junior officer.
"Cocktail rings with world city flavor," says Director Reinhard Dean calls his concept.
50 cities on the tour almost 3000 kilometres can now experience this atmosphere.

"The animals belong to our family," said Stephanie mother, Brigitte, Dean.
Shortcomings in the behaviour of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Dean also takes this stance: "it is not good for our animals, it is also not good."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy stroking each.
"The four-legged artists," as they are affectionately known, will be able to read all of the wishes of the eyes.
We want to work with the animals with them and have fun.
The animal does not feel comfortable, it is not even in the riding school.

Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a zebra filly, the Dean family is proud of.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a corral and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Dean.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the riding school, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus for Dean.
For each visitor, so something is likely to be involved.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Dean: "no matter whether five or 1200 spectators, we always do our best and are here with all my heart."
