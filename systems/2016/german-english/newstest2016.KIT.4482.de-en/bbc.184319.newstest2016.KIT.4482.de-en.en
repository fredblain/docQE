As you share your stories, pictures and videos with BBC News
Every day BBC News - on TV, on radio and online - will bring you the latest stories from around the world... but what we want to hear are the issues that are important to you.
The role you play in creating the news is very important.
Whether it is news or an issue you have, your contribution can make a difference.
Have you seen an event or have you been affected?
There is something significant, bizarre or unusual in your environment?
Do you have a story to tell, or is there something that you should follow your opinion?
There are issues that you want to launch talks?
What do you want to comment on?
Or do you want to find out what other people talk about?
