Arsenal's captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wils here
Wenger stressed to Brentwood here that it was not until September, and if his rehabilitation goes smoothly, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Brentwood here surely will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that here the Brentwood last season had ended badly after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the early season.
"This type of injury is not career threatening," said Wenger.
It is a bone that does not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankle, or with the injury he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, there is also the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It has also developed a nasty pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different pathologies of Brentwood here since his debut six years ago.
He played in only 65 games for arsenal 157 league over the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, which most violation days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you must strengthen your body and fight to win," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs, Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I am trying to keep the balance and the players who need a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the most intimidating effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium on Tuesday evening was shattered by an earthquake, measured on the Richter scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal's lesson has been learned from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph with his management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business, to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.
