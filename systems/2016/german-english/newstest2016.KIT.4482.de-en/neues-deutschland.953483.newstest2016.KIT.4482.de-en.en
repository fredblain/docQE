The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are pretenders.
This option also connects with some billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.
Whether he is xenophobic, male journalists or gaps in their knowledge of the international crisis policy revealed - the candidate for the US presidency swirled vigorously on the election campaign.
And performs well here.
This will be recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire.
The New York City with the Föhnfrisur is many in the village of winemakers on the Wine Route.
Some of the 1200 people on the ground - dozens of corners is related to him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalzen: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel on Trump.
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think that is the kind of exciting, but also in its Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has filmed a humorous documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including next to Trump, the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is in "kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so to speak - by saying that he would also be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
The king of hearts, he has not brought it there.
While there is respect for the power of the family, but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," said Wendel.
Strangely enough, the noisy nickname, Kallstadt in the vicinity, "the Brulljesmacher" - to high English: the show, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of pretenders.
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the grandfather and later opened a restaurant for gold rush in the US.
Foundation stone of the real estate company was the first piece of land purchases in New York.
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: their desire to return permanently to the home failed, the Bavarian state, which then belonged to the Pfalz.
He did not include Trump, because he once was hewn down without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the movie to start.
He is the grandson of an ' illegal immigrant '.
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the offspring.
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants.
"As the noise, it is not so appealing," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin Trump ("Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The retired vintner sees the Americans rather aloof, "he is always so effervescent."
Does he think that Trump is?
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old girl.
"He has never taken care of Kallstadt."
The Pensionswirtin Veronika Schramm mentioned how many Kallstadter, a descendant of the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ donated what was generally a good thing.
"I can't imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old girl.
You think it would be better if he did not win the election, because "such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
If those who had been at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots, as he had, "he would never arrived there."
"There are interesting issues than him," says vintner daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as a President?
It is not "my president," she says.
And: "the grapes are ripe," without the President Trump.
Wendel Film, was interviewed for the Trump, have long seen 12000 Kinogänger, even in the US is stirring the interest.
