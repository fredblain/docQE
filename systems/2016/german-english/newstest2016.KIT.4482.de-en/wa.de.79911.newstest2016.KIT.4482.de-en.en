Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus was painted with the (gold-plated crown of thorns) is one of the main works, Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus Alte Post has written the introduction of updated and Biblical texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now with splendid images.
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has formulated 150 motives of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes of the 75-year-old has won - but what is not synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, adapted to the specific issues that may seem pretty bleak.
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible-project, for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many issues of the "book of all the books."
Cycles are created that address issues such as crossroads, plagues, bids, or the Our Father.
He is fascinated by spontaneously several partners: this applies to the Lutheran publishing house with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publishing house, with its emphasis on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Alte Post, who has dealt with the Bible on the basis of the painting.
He has interpreted the Bible by Otmar Alt-selected and so to the present day, "translated into current correlations."
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings.
They are embedded between the original bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist, here expressed his own personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewelry has golden cover letters.
This allows the 75-year-old girl twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high degree of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately led to the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"As the education ever happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I have tried to cope with this, to me, perhaps with the Lord," father.
His second concern was to restore art in fast-paced time to give more importance: " the perception of visual worlds today is influenced by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is being suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and bliss to show things.
Pictures have always been somewhat mysterious, and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to the images of "fall", they seem to be discovered, and what power they have: "the picture is looking for his counterpart."
Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, "has always been" to be a lover of Otmar Alt art: "I like how he lives with his pictures."
It did not look old, the Bible to fully comprehend, but for the important issues, even mysterious.
"This was not a collaboration on a level playing field," says Alte Post: "this is about the images, the text only." Was a picture-Bible.
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing this work is to find an invitation to deepen "his life and freedom."
Otmar Alt pictures speak for Möhler, both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings for the first time - will be presented in an exhibition that will open on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.
