Xavi: pep Guardiola did 2008 change to the FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi plays for Al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago, shortly before the commitment of the Spanish superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time Cup winner, four-times Champions League winner, two-time club world champions, European champions two times, once a world champion title - the list of Xavi is staggering.
In summer, the now 35-year-old girl left after 24 years of FC Barcelona and moved to the Al-Sadd Sports Club after Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca Xavi now tells us that he was standing in front of the departure from Barcelona before Euro 2008.
"They told me that Barça wants to sell me."
"Madrid won everything, then we have nothing," he recounts.
And it also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "there has been an offer from Bavaria."
"Rumenigge wanted me."
As a reminder, in the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann, the Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that not switched Xavi
But the change has not occurred.
And the key man for now works for the German record champions: pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça Guardiola has under contract and I have played a great EM."
"Pep has told me that I would not change that, he could imagine the team without me."
"He has got to me."
Who knows how Bavaria season 2008/2009 with Xavi would be over.
Xavi was for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the turf, the switch from Red (4: 0 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the King class triumph.
