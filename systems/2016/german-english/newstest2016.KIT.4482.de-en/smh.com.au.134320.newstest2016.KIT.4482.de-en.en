Man after a wet police-chase, persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he talked to the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth, to depend on the police, was unsuccessful, as he stood in the shallow and swampy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to "gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police in Canning Vale on Tuesday was called to a break-in incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspects, this attempted to escape from them towards the Canning River.
But he did not go too far.
"He stood in the water and said ' I do not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sgt. Shan Dell Castle Dine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactics - "a good policeman."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said senior sergeant Castle Dine.
Championship football player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable example.

His efforts were unsuccessful, but has inspired locals to the humorous planning of Ben's cousin-Biathlon.
