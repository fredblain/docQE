In many places around the country are short of doctors - Asendorf against lucky: there, Dr. Frank Mueller's practice Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen retires, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, his successor in the next couple of months with a half-point.
After a phase of Müller opened the practice again on 12 October, until then, he invested 310000 euros in the premises at St Marcellus Road 6.
It was sympathetic at first glance, when the Felstehausens years ago Frank Muller and his wife became familiar with Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, currently their specialist training in Verdener hospital and next year will also be in the practice.
"We have always had in mind that Mueller would fit nicely into this practice," says Dr Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was ready, I have just phoned them."
The couple liked the idea of Muller to run his own practice in Asendorf.
"The closeness and the constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Mueller.
"We want to get to know the families over the years."
As an advantage, he can also see, soon to be his own boss.
And it was generally agreed that Mueller bought the house with the practice.
They will, however, continue to live in breakage Vilsen.
The two-time family man Frank Muller grew up, followed by his medical studies in Hanover stations in several doctors ' offices and hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a Head of Department in Sulingen, he also was appointed to the senior emergency physician in the district of Diepholz, 2009 and has been involved as volunteers in the DRC-readiness breakage Vilsen.
As of September 19, the practice is being prepared for the new chief.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a doctor, his wife Ursel (Internistin) specialises in the gastroenterology.
The Mueller, both internists, want to establish themselves as a family doctor.
"It is possible, therefore, to be released," says the 38-year-old Silvia Mueller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests and long-term- and stress-EKGs and need one more surgery.
In addition, the computer will be completely renovated.
Get a stipend from a total of 50000 euros, the Mueller in the context of a programme of support from the county (25000 euros), as well as from the velvet municipality (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how happy and proud we are that the practice will continue," said velvet municipality mayor Bernd Bormann.
About 2000 patients, according to Silvia Mueller-Gongoll each quarter in the practice Felstehausen, there are about 500 in the northern German average practice.
There is another house in Asendorf doctor's practice.
One positive side-effect of the practice of takeover by Frank Mueller: the pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, they would be gone too.
Anyone who visited Müller appointments, incidentally, looks to continue, especially in familiar faces: the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced for 30 years.
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen humorous.
A little bit of sadness they feel after a long period of time.
"But we continue to live in High Moor and many patients will surely see more often," says the Internistin.
Her husband added laughing: "we have a 6000-square-metre plot."
"I've always avoided gardening, now could be different."
The couple also has two grandchildren and loves to travel.
