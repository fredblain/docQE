Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the opinion of the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly described as "special K," the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters spotlight.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards had Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison divorced twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaim: "Wawrinka should have Kyrgios beat, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racket, after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth in the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi a little was dragged into the dispute," said Healy.
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who broke a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he is in the US Open has behaved extremely well, even among the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was a little harsh.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he is working very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleidebereich, he trained hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision, Kyrgios in failing to take into account the important qualifiers, which starts on Friday, and he describes the " joint decision " as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, to return as a long-term is an integral part of the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I believe that Nick has risen quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
