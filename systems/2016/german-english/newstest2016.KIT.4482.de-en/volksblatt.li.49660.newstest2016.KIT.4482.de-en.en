Now Rome has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there are now in Rome, a Martin Luther Square.
In the presence of City president Ignazio Marino was baptized in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday, a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio Hill.
He will be on the "Piazza Martin Lutero" now "as the German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located next to the Colosseum in ancient Rome.
The name was requested by the Association of Evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, leader of the Methodist movement, priest-Lutheran congregation in Rome on Wednesday, recalled that the Protestants in the city of popes for centuries as a minority, often only able to live in the shadows of their faith.
The square will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christianity in Rome is welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed as a young Augustinerm√∂nch at the turn of the year for some months in Rome.
Then he saw the city as a depraved sins of Babel.
His negative impressions may have encouraged him to think of historians in his subsequent fight against Rome.
Then, Luther had begun with his arguments against the indulgences of the division of the Western Church.
