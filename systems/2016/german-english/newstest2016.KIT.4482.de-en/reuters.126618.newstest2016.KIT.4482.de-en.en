Google launches Verdoppelungs-donation campaign to earn $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign, which raised $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, because they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation appeal on his blog.
Rather than let a manager make the announcement, " wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee, who has fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark rail and bus routes, as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family desperately for help.
The donations will go to four nonprofit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com/Refugee Relief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
