Washington criticized Israel's ongoing settlement construction and Netanyahu unwillingness in the peace process.

In an emergency, Professor confesses to shooting his girlfriend
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In an emergency, Professor Shannon Lamb told a somewhat tremulous voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Lamb, it was important to stress that his "cute dog" but still live and was probably excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman contacts could be found on the phone.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss, a handwritten note that was scrawled on a white block: "I am sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, has already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he was shot and killed, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said that his university employees the shooting heard at 10: 18 pm.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He said that Lamb made the fateful call at some point after that.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
By the end of the day, there was another death: lamb committed suicide when police surrounded him.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
A day after the shootings at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The details released by investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what the students and staff who knew him testify, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Students said that they were looking forward to his lessons.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal record.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Schmidt's Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him, in which he spoke of the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Both teach in the department of social sciences and history, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
At the same time, there were some inclines to problematic behaviors.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the Lamb, said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Lamb had previously at Delta State University asked for a leave for medical reasons and said that he had any health problem.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This year, he taught only two online courses.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard for him, would not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr. Lambs notion."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
These are questions that can no longer reply to lamb.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
After fleeing the campus police found the Lambs later track, when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Before he could be arrested Lamb, killed himself selbstmit a d caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents ' house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
His car was still in the driveway.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Lamb grew up in the area.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009, which has 3500 students in a city with about 12000 inhabitants, and taught geography and pedagogy.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when she met through common friends.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her to play the guitar.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
He was the crowd of women.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
All the girls melt away when he was there, " said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Jackson, Brandon.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Lamb and Prentiss were obvious for some time.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The emergency call Lamb said: "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which shares a border with a Bayou in Gautier.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The police said that the dog was in order.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O ' Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter, who was 19 years old.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"She was totally devastated," said O ' Steen about his daughter.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
O ' Steen said he had never met, but Lamb by his daughter, Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Lamb hit Prentiss, when he and Abigail three years ago at a summer-year market.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
They later played together one or two gigs.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
O ' Steen, said his daughter, sings and writes her own music.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a low-lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5, the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and Mundharmonikaspiel finished a meager audience.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
"Just a happy couple," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
We were in the clean up and joked with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
I think they both had a good sense of joke.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Schmidt, a dead professor, headed the first-year seminar program, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
He was married and had three small children.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.

In the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including teachers, staff, students and members of the community in a candle lighting ceremony.

Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, during the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and sang "amazing Grace."
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
"We are trying to encourage our students to go back," said LaForge.

The crisis is over.

This is a day of healing.

</seg>
<seg id="62">
The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call, after he had shot, Schmidt and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss is referred to as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were ever married.

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria

<seg id="2">
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "there is no military solution" to the conflict lasted nearly five years, and more weapons of violence and misery for millions of people will only make matters worse.

8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Others have dismissed it as a joke.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And some are waiting for a collapse.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But regardless of how some Republicans are trying to take Donald Trump from the upper echelons in the polls, it has not worked (yet).
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump leading in double digits, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously, what does it mean for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
No one contends that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership on the rising Herman Cain was made, none of which has only won one state in the nominating process.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to topple him.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Here are some of the latest poll numbers, which suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a passing phase.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Trump's popularity ratings have been rotated by 180 degrees.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a real-estate mogul.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
There were 40 per cent by mid-July.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Roughly three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
And keep these numbers in early states.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with GOP candidates as Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Last week, in a poll conducted by CNN/ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Only two out of 10 saying they were "upset" if he were the nominee.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "thrilled" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The next in terms of excitement?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters leaning to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The same is true in the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to the Quinnipiac last week.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Nevertheless, 44 per cent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament did not fit into the White House, ABC/Post.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Republican voters get used to the idea.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
If they keep their hats to scholars Trump, Republican voters for real.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week, four out of ten, that Trump is the best bet.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clear crystal globe in the past.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
At this time last cycle, four out of ten Republicans, Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% of the final candidate Mitt Romney.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
However, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign, viewed as a plausible.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Even if the Republicans are gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everybody.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Some experts suggest that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump's support is spread over more than a dozen other candidates diffuse.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
He has Carly Fiorina 13-point lead before Marco Rubio 14 points, Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and, finally, from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The only candidate who beats him?
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
A narrow majority of Donald Trump's fans say that they have formed their opinions.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have lost their voices.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, the view never changes.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to other candidates.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
However, Trump's strongest competition at the moment the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions, are twice as often for Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump when it comes to immigration.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico called "rapists" that immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
Some are concerned that the bombastic language critical of Trump Hispanic-Americans will stay away from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs's efforts.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
But according to the new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it seems to be Donald Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
The frustration over the government climbed to new highs.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, now accounts for roughly half of the support of Republican voters, particularly by their outsider status.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Six of 10 Republicans say the new Monday-ABC/Post, they would rather have a political outsider, as someone with government experience.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
And they are also angry at Washington.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg two weeks ago in Iowa shows that three out of four of Iowa's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "unhappy" and 21 percent "hellish angry."

Champions League: Bayern's dream start thanks to Müller and idol
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Two scorers in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Mueller has just one run.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A lucky strike by Thomas Müller's FC Bayern paved the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The world champion Thomas Mueller and Mario Goetze in the cauldron of Piraeus had a dream start in the "mission" of the FC Bayern.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Mueller double Pack (52/90 + 2) and Götzes hits (earned), with 3: 0 (0: 0).
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The twelfth home success in the series will be the first step towards final on May 28, 2016, in Italy, where Guardiola at the third attempt to finally bring the Henkel Potts to Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Mueller got his 28th goal in the Champions League to Bayern's benevolent assistance of Olympiakos's goalkeeper Roberto, who had a shot intended as a flank of the World Cup.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"We will not underestimate them," Bavaria's captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31688 capture fans - and the thought of Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They showed a focussed and committed performance, without having to shine.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Piraeus had won its last six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs like Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
2011 stumbled here also Borussia Dortmund (1-3).
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But the Bavarians, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
They were brave, but ran in their offensive efforts often unimaginative to work.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The attacks were often initiated by game shift to external links, Douglas Costa, who opposed the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui rarely occurred.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Müller had more luck on the right when his flank from the right mid-field in the top left Toreck.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In the 66th minute, the world champion of the possible 2-0.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The best times in one half had Robert Lewandowski.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
First of all, when Olympiakos-striker Ideye Brown, the head of the ball, beat Poland from the line (26).
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Then, by direct inspection, the goalkeeper parried Roberto with the knee (35th).
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Although the Bayern used to affix their dominant game, Piraeus needle stitches.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
At goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was our bond.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
For example, when he took a shot of Ideye on the Latte (56th).
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Before Guardiola re-erected a chain of four with David Alaba in the centre of defence alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Mario Goetze, according to muskulären problems back in the squad, was sitting outside.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The World Cup hero was only after the completion of training given the green light, said member Matthias Sammer in "sky": "anyone who wants to make something different out of it, that is evil."
</seg>
<seg id="27">
At the first change of Guardiola also decided against him, when he brought Kingsley Coman for beleaguered Lewandowski (59th).
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Goetze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and 13 minutes later, everything was clear, via penalty, Müller.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Before the game, it was in the stadium riot.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
After a smaller group of partially masked and Bayern fans in their viewers-block apparently provoked the followers of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and went in with batons against the Munich-based supporters.

At least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium.

</seg>
<seg id="3">
The good news: the risk of abandonment is declining quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This is the long-term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam, Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Compared to non-smokers, in smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely to the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The scientists had observed more than 23300 subscribers.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The main causes of tooth loss are cavities and inflammation of the gums, the DIfE.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
For these periodontitis is smoking a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The link between smoking and tooth loss, therefore, go to frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Is not clear the extent to which smoking also increases the risk for tooth decay.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
However, it could take more than ten years, until the danger to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham England.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We need to convince people, to be non-smokers, said study director Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "smoking shortens life."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Smoking is not good for lungs and blood vessels and leads to an old age, according to our findings, even on a good dental health.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population are affected by loss of teeth at the age of 65 to 74 years, divided the DIfE.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increase the risk for early tooth loss.

The new long-term study confirm the findings.

EU Commission proposes in row over new court TTIP
</seg>
<seg id="2">
To defuse the dispute over the planned trans-Atlantic free trade agreement, TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The controversial private arbitration institutions for resolving disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is far more traditional in its functioning.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"We want to establish a system, the trust of the citizens," declared the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the launch.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The Swede has, to put forward the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The German government announced support.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Via TTIP is intended to create the largest free-trade zone in the world, with 800 million people.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The plans to reform the current arbitration specifically stipulate that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They are in equal parts from the EU, the US and from non-EU countries.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Is also scheduled for the first time a second resort.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It would make it possible to collect judgments against the opposition.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
So far, the procedures involved with each other on the referee, it was not an appeal against their sentences.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice are not trusted, Malmström said.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In the long term, it wants to work towards an international investment court according to their own.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
There could then be addressed, for example, also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
In particular, required by large corporations, investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is considered one of the main reasons for the huge resistance to TTIP in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, on the corporate compensation at the expense of the taxpayer can wrest, national laws to nullify or a lowering of consumer protection and environmental standards.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In early statements anti-TTIP organizations like Campact described the proposals by the EU Commission as inadequate.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It was criticized, in particular, that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free-trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The German economy Staatssekretär Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as a major step forward.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The Commission has taken into account in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel is working with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The old system of private arbitration was off the table.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The European companies ' organization warned that the action potential of the economy by restricting too many new rules.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In particular, small and medium-sized businesses could be adversely affected, it said.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) can be completed on Wednesday, remained unclear.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The issue of protection of investors, however, has not yet been discussed with the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Originally, there should be a framework for the agreement as early as the end of this year.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
This date is regarded as no longer tenable.

Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Eleven years ago sits Sufjan Stevens on stage at the Cologne-based Prime Club (now: Luxor).
</seg>
<seg id="3">
He was standing next to a flip chart, which has recorded the shy-looking folk the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt-tip pen.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The entire audience, about 40 people, was almost taken by Stevens lectures.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He recounts in the different places that he is still drawing on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Where they are born and how it looks like there, in his home.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Since then, Stevens is proving to be a wonderfully creative.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
With the 2003 and third album, "greetings From Michigan: the Great Lake State" appear wise composed songs that nestles snugly close to American folk music of the late sixties, but each time drifting into great opulent.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of an audacious series: each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But back in 2004 and in the Rhine River near Seven Swans " has already been released and breaks some positive expectations.

The album is rising in the US Billboard Charts and is lacking in any year best list of influential music media.

After very productive experiments Stevens then operated on "the Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic sets.

This sixth proper studio album is still wide, but orchestrated by programmed sequences or beats and playing with all sorts of effects and reverb.

Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut with the Prime Minister's Question Time awaits with anticipation
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is making his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time with David Cameron for the first time.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Mr Corbyn will rise to the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after noon, and probably his performance by the media and the Labour MEPs will be examined closely.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He called for "less theatrical and more facts on this weekly event."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He also said that he could skip some meetings in order to leave them to colleagues.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In the meantime, the decision by the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a memorial ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, in silence, criticism from a number of Tory MPs has provoked and lies at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they cite differences in economic, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences within Labour "pile up" after Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that presenting Labour amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £ 26000 to £ 23000.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and have given him more than 30000 comments.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he is both "repartee" and refrain from the dispute with barbs and instead has to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will replace him when he is not taking part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
He has also presented the idea that others sometimes take the floor, and that he was John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, raised, in order to discuss the problem.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In 2005, when he was leader, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to move away from the politics in the style of a "Punchinello-Theater," which is often linked to the questions of the Prime Minister, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time was seen with the Prime Minister as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, even though critics have argued that it is become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.

Burberry shares were higher after encouraging news from the rival company for luxury goods Richemont 0.9%.

But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.

Pegida brings Lebanese poster to Kartoffeldöner idea

Potatoes or Döner?

<seg id="3">
It is both - and in the Kartoffeldöner has developed the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay.

Inspired by the slogan "potatoes rather than döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement has Alhay potatoes and meat on a skewer.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The idea made him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner," which he had seen on television.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Since then, his shop is in a Grillspieß, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"This is multicultural in the stomach," says Alhay.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The idea has now joined the Lebanese in the Patent Office in Munich.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There, it is protected, according to the agency as a utility model.
</seg>

How much meat and how much potatoes contain the skewer, Alhay not betrayed.

Metcash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat incursions by Aldi
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in an Aldi-rally in South Australia and Western Australia.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a Bodenständigkeits-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ Aldi invasion.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
While Aldi prepares for the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets, their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand through IGA mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well on events such as Adelaide show.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from Dunsborough, distributed the samples in IGA stores and shop owners to sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy, published on September 29, when the wholesale distributor of food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
There is much at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia generate nearly 30 percent, and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Oststaat of Metcashs IGA store shops.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously insular and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaat.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets snapped up around five percent of the food market in those two states, and all the existing players, but mostly independent retailers will take away sales.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
A report published this week estimated that the analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million could lose by the end of 2016.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This prediction is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million will be in every market.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The loss in the food business and the volume of Metcashs high fixed-cost base could Metcash around $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Oststaat, primarily at Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food business by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 will fall and the market share of 14 percent to 10.3% in 2015-2020 will be reduced.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Metcash declined to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But it is believed that a board member of Metcash has recorded with Mr. Douglass last week.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
IGAs market share has fallen from 18 per cent since 2010 to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food trade, which supplies roughly 1200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational deleverage at the same time, pressure on sales and margins.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The big retailers are fighting back, however, and has invested more than $150 million to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products every week to assimilate and IGA retailers to improve their shops by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private-label foods.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and remediation programs at Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will in 2017 for the first time in four years to return to profit growth.

Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the opinion of the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly described as "special K," the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters spotlight.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon afterwards had Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison divorced twice by the referee, with Harrison exclaim: "Wawrinka should have Kyrgios beat, and I should beat the child."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racket, after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth in the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi a little was dragged into the dispute," said Healy.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He has broken a racquet when he lost because of a cramp in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who broke a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
But, really, he is in the US Open has behaved extremely well, even among the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much credit.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was a little harsh.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he is working very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleidebereich, he trained hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Healy also supported the decision, Kyrgios in failing to take into account the important qualifiers, which starts on Friday, and he describes the " joint decision " as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, to return as a long-term is an integral part of the team. "
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around it [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And I believe that Nick has risen quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he receives, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.

Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, refugees return
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Hungary declared a state of emergency and drops from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants gather in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The people who fled from violence, got stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two countries control points and erected tents and settled down there.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But frustrations grew.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanting "open the border!" And shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Some lawn in protest of food and water.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Serbia's Foreign Minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not the collateral damage.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, " said Ivica Dacic, in Prague.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The minister, however, agreed to share the responsibility for the 40000 people who sought refuge in überrumpelt Italy and Greece, they expressed their hope that finally - next month - or until the end of the year reached an agreement that the EU states would pick up a further 120000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Chancellor Angela Merkel, Austria, on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union, to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Hungary was not, however, his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The state of emergency on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so they closed off roads and were able to speed up asylum procedures.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said meanwhile that his country is also building a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania plan to stop the influx of migrants across the country, once it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
CBS News correspondent Charlie D 'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race to build a barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, have been used.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, are entitled to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, to make the crossing the border or become damaged in the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence, the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime, these laws also set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"Because of the situation that is caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the misery," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
We make it very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Parliament must still approve procedural or the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Gyorgy Bakondi, country-security consultant for Orban, said that authorities have 45 people while trying to cross the border were seized, 15 others have penetrated deeper into the country.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are being accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Authorities are working to fix the fence quickly.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train cars had arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to get hineindrängen.

About 20 were to join, but thousands were left outside.

Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll, halved
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead over the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17%).
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he ran for president, receives the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
More than five months before the start of the primaries, the majority of Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their feelings are clear, which candidate they will support.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But Clinton's supporters are more persistent in their choice than the other candidates.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Clinton holds a strong lead among women and moderates, but the margin has narrowed.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Their support among men has fallen markedly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
However, Clinton still has a large advantage for older voters.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Last month, Clinton was Sanders, with double-digit lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point margin in this group.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
About half of Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support it only because she is the nominee.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Six percent would not support them.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters in particular are fascinated by her.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
</seg>
<seg id="19">
If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to, that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman President (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of Clinton's supporters also mentions its connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
As the Vice President raises the potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - even though one-third believes that he should not do it.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
If the democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Supporters of Clinton's more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's increased ahead of Sanders, 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Biden is by far a second in this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the "wählbarsten," has risen.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
However, with the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters cite issues of eligibility.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Much like last month stands out, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the primaries, these voters as unacceptable.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some of the important features of their party primaries with voters.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Biden raises the three best candidates for honesty, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many people say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Democratic voters in the primaries, in general, see also Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In all of these measurements, around a quarter of Democratic voters do not agree with Sanders.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the term of office as Secretary of State, the majority of Democratic voters are satisfied with the primaries with their explanation of the issue and say that it has not influenced their opinions.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one-third is satisfied.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Public opinion was divided on this in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of it was even worse.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
They are mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them among a total of registered voters: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 fewer points since May.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
62 percent of those eligible do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
At the same time, 55 percent of the electorate can see across the country including Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Clinton and Trump, however, received good marks for leadership.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush score best with honesty.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
A majority of Sanders looks more honest than that, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.

Ben Carson is located in the latest poll from CBS News/New York Times behind Donald Trump

Support of Republican voters nationwide continue to Trump in great numbers, there is growing support in the latest CBS poll, the Fox News debate last month was carried out by 23%, 27% in the poll on Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Carson leapt from 6% in the same period to 23%.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The survey also found that Carson does well with demographic groups and surpasses Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, is teeing off with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen on the deepest, and the support of 10% to now 2% last month.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are 6% in the third place.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The error margin for the sample of 376 people of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 percent and was conducted in September.

The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls - he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.

Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Baruch College-tainted newcomer
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Almost two years after a student during a ritual bullying a student liaison in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, died, murder charges will be filed against five people.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity Chun "Michael" Deng during a brutal initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Officials said he had been charged with a 30-pound backpack full of sand with eyes blindfolded, and had been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out to a goal on a frozen field.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Mr. Deng finally complained of headaches, he then fell unconscious.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Fraternity called the emergency number 911, fainted after Deng and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
However, they had the time to move on to Deng's clothes, googled his symptoms and Andy Meng, to contact the national president of the Brotherhood in order to catch up with the Council, the police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle about the Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He could not be revived and he died of his injuries the next morning.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
After an autopsy report, Deng has been repeatedly inflicted by blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Too many families have been destroyed by the bullying of the Brotherhood, at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the bullying," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, also indicted for vexatious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"We do not want to blame the people involved, but only if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, so we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation to the group.

This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
</seg>
<seg id="2">
A rate increase is coming, and the bull market will falter, yields on bonds will rise and the economy will slide into a recession.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
We know that.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
What we do not know is how long all this and how long it will continue.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how to respond to the economy and the financial assets.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Therefore, representatives of the Federal Reserve have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is necessary for the normalization.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In fact, several variables play a role.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
At the end of the market participants, however, may find that the outburst may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"The first increase by the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level, in order to lead to a seismic shock that many appear to fear.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Here is a look at historical trends based on how some parts of the economy could respond:
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Once the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"It seems to me that there is a tendency that asset returns will choke off 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens to interest rate hikes by the Fed.

More specifically, the market is pretty flat over the past 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates, then the 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of return over the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, in Barron's.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the cycle and increase the rate of return that is beginning to decrease.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rates often encourage them.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Most remarkable is that the GDP will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
According to Deutsche Bank was among the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950, the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and we expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of whether "this time it is different," said Deutsche Bank.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Participants in the market throughout the year have been caught on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC might approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in terms of GDP and the pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows," says the report.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The current cycle is by far the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar to the capital market.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The main difference is that the effect is faster in bonds than in stocks, though the change its strategic direction.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The returns on bonds seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
At the end of the cycle, increasing bond yields will fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The strategists of Charles Schwab, believe that the increase in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer to one another and lead to a tailing off of the curve.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
High-yielding bonds often yield better returns, even though "we still are cautious to expect higher returns in such a climate," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened its strategy.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
By and large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US, stands to benefit if interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as the financing of its debt.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"History shows that the" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively, three months after an initial increase in interest rates," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the client.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Companies with strong balance-sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004 exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their stocks outperform their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Debt is a big problem.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
Companies with a high degree of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Outside of the pure stock of games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts are divided on how quickly this will take place.

BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"
</seg>
<seg id="3">
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she only imitated The Brit
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Parliament's colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that it was not very clever.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament and new increased pressure on the broadcaster, to prove that he does something that the private sector do not.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly impossible to distinguish from its commercial counterparts.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"Seems to be Radio 3 - I use the word" verdummen "does not like to - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It also was aimed at the BBC Music Awards, which began last December.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appears only at The Brit to be under a different name.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
So, if you try to do something different - these are spontaneously mentioned two examples where you actually just mimic what is already on the market, " said Mr. Bingham.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
What I learn from Radio 3, I am going anywhere else to learn about classical music.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and new works in order to give, I feel really important," he said.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Earlier this year argued the BBC Radio 3 controller Alan initally composed using Davey that it should be harder to engage the audience than it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing at the Committee for the selection of Culture, Media and Sport to commercial rivals on the toes.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent of the BBC show, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
You will see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly striking?
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC-produced" way.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
He added that he hoped that the company "a hit in our own barn find," if it is the next time you start a conversation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
However, he refused to rule out the purchase of a further series of The Voice in the future or money from the fee payers to spend on other entertainment formats.

Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In the first three months of 2015, there were seven per cent rise in online sales.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Last month, there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Online sales grew three years ago by the use of mobile phones to shop
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November has put the brakes on spending
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For more than a decade, the virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales will stagnate, after new figures showed only seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Experts say that there are signs that online sales will stagnate, after new figures show only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous year, and go back to 2000, it has evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG-sales index.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He said that online sales increased three years ago, when buyers started with their mobile phones to make purchases.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the couch.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
But now it is leveling off, and we will probably see that growth is decreasing.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining revenues.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Experts believe that, buyers keep their purchases before the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Last year, rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bargains, and some retailers ' websites plummeted.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyers fight for bargains could deter buyers to make purchases.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending by £ 5 a bit more than £ 1 was spent online.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third of purchases are now being carried out on web stores.

The bodies of 29 beter, who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca, were carried through the streets.
</seg>

Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage, when the crane crashed down.

Mr Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Grand Mosque.

Saudi officials have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city, will continue.

Today, King Salman said that the Bin Laden group would not leave the arm of a crane when he was not used.

The English-language service of the news agency reported that detail, but said that the leadership of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.

The Bin Laden group has issued no statements about the crane collapse, and their representatives were not available for comment.

Officials of Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Klagenfurt district court on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice-Master Aich/Dob due to infidelity and tax evasion.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The well-known defendants are not guilty.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
By this accusation, he has been effectively cleared last May.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The current trial was postponed.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
According to prosecutor Robert Riffel had emerged in the preliminary examination that the defendants in the years 2006-2011 funds of club accounts, on which they were allowed in their functions, used for private purposes.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
He estimated the damage at around 400000 euros.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The sports officials are also accused of financial crimes.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This fact blew the chairman of the Senate jury, Judge Michaela Sanin.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
To discard the infidelity, the defense argued that the club was at no time a fortune.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The sports officials have charged only allowances and the sports club, for which they have been operating from 1982 to 2011 and they have invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities amounted to 600000 in 2001, Schilling (approximately 44000 euros).
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"Then we were faced with the situation: we continue to lead the club or we terminate?," said one of the defendants, in a large bread professional auditor of the Financial District.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
He and his colleague and co have decided to take on this task.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
With all the risks.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"We have money, upfronted our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said at the hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
With the club, it was agreed that they can manage the money, it may only be made no debt.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Furthermore, with adequate financial success - the payment of the allowances retroactive to 1991 had been decided.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Therefore, it is a part of the allowances only years later, in the year 2003, when an increase in the bank account had been paid off.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
So, too, seemed flat and not Detailabbuchungen, explained the former chairman of the operations.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The managed accounts and savings books together, the two defendants, said the second defendant.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Why the payouts, the club have not been disclosed in detail, asked the judge.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The club was not interested in the details of the finances, important only if the debt was freedom, according to the answer.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In 2011, as against the began an official investigation for abuse of office, was paid an amount of EUR 120000 on the association's bank account.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The reserves have been declared the defendants.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
This securities account amounted to the name of the second defendant and was not known, according to its statement to the club.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"Why?" The judge wanted to know.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The respondent knew no answer.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
If something had happened to him, no one would have known something of this money, the prosecutor in the room.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The co was informed, the official added.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
This transfer was phrased as "damage reparation."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Why? Concept, judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
This is the first defendant stated that he was not satisfied with this wording, because the club would never have suffered damage.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But what do I do if the lawyer says: "you are all off the hook."
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"I am a lawyer?" He asked.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
In addition, the official said that he never got a cent of salary, he was charged only mileage allowance and diets.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He attended the club salary of EUR 1000 per month, the actual cost was much higher, however, he added.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Accurate records for the early years of the defendants were not present.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
They are following a business review, in which everything has been judged to be correct, was not kept, they said.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Miles also had money in the second defendant.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
All of the fixes were in cash that he had to travel from his home international market to the bank after Bleiburg, he declared in his statement.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The main negotiations will resume on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.

Röszke: violence erupted in Serb-Hungarian border

<seg id="2">
The Hungarian police have deployed to the Serbian border at Röszke tear gas and water cannons against hundreds of angry refugees.

Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border check point.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He talked by phone:
</seg>
<seg id="5">
A group of refugees broke through the border.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It had formed a police line and stood behind a police water cannon.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
40-50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles, according to the officials.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The officials initially set an uninterrupted pepper spray.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The police then used tear-gas.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Much tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The group was disbanded.

Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The world is watching, when the US Federal Reserve in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision as to whether, for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rate will be raised or not.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
A survey of 80 economists, who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half, which only last week was of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will still remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the present level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates to zero.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a major central bank may leave the zero area and starts the process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The US economy is on a relatively good performance status, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate a low inflation.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global relationships.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the chances are good against such a move.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The decision will be announced at 8.00 p.m. CET on Thursday

Shooter at Delta State University left behind letters of apology
</seg>
<seg id="2">
After the shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day before shooting and killing his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that he was "sorry" do at the first murder, "and he could undo it," said authorities announced on Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, the emergency number around 10: 00 am on Monday morning call
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And said he had shot at someone and killed someone.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Lamb said the emergency call centre staff that the police had to send police to his home.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet" dog in the house, but "no one will bother," but probably will be excited.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not have it.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand written note from Lamb, 45, who said: " I am sorry, I wish I could undo it.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "
</seg>
<seg id="11">
After writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, when police surrounded him.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr. Lambs notion."
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" of a "triangular relationship."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Prentiss was Shawn O ' Steen, who testified that they were married about seven years, described as a "good man."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
O ' Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who is 19 and she was "devastated".
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He said that Prentiss her daughter was "absolutely the best of friends."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Herald Sun as a close friend of Prentiss.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, met with lamb for about three years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The police said that Lamb telephoned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he did not go to jail."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
When police caught him on Highway 1 near Greenville later this night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the woods and killed himself with a pistol.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Lamb was awarded in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University, a PhD, as its Lebenslau on the website of the university.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double-fracture
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven Manchester a double fracture of his right leg.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
While this brought the left-side defenders cry and will preclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not in the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The breach was caused by a reckless attack by Hector Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Van Gaal said: "he has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He will be tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18, it is very difficult and it is fantastic, and then this happens.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
He wept.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
I hope that he can play again this season.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee has not punished, the Mexicans.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Van Gaal conjectured that the Italian referee had got it wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You can judge for themselves, when I say that were a penalty and a red card.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "I would like to thank you all for your news. Words cannot describe how I am broke, my road to recovery begins now, I will come back stronger."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Referring to this: Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in the defeat at PSV
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The England defender has been with the European Championships in France an extra incentive to recover until next June.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach said: "it is a very serious violation."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, are all very sad.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Moreno suffered a leg fracture, when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland team at the World Cup in 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"It is very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and then, when you hear that it is a very serious injury, that is not good," said Cocu.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The only thing I could see was the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In conversation with Moreno SBS6 said: " I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be anything.

David Cameron certainly knows better, The Lorax?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
It is one thing all parents soon learn: if your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Unless perhaps you are David Cameron.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr Seuss graced.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "funny, emotional, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be an image or a message that we have missed so far."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the film version of 2012, which added new characters and details, in order to expand the original text is rather short.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest was Dr. Seuss graced, whose real name was Theodor Seuss graced hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
As if that weren't suspicious enough: the text proposed by Cameron reads in part, as the summary of the Lorax-film, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "in the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is the plot of the book is so unfamiliar, here is an unnamed boy listens, as the local environment by the money-grabbing fourth guessing, trees, Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name Lorax, a huddled, his essence, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It was highly likely that such a relatively low PR task delegated to a worker who has read The Lorax not 20 times in a row, to a child.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A Downing Street spokesperson said that the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but there was no further immediate comment.

</seg>

In the United Arab Emirates to Pakistan, is a difficult task, but if you have selected the squad, England for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.

<seg id="3">
I would not rule out an away victory.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Alastair Cook's side is probably less than three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting position, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars of 2012, only a youthful, positive attitude.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
With the ball develops Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for the attack.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
This related news: Adam Lyth leaves the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, for me, as his head coach, in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyse.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There was no question mark when Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this earlier - players are their own best chooser.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Long ago we could have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if it is not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; above all, he is a team man.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Lyth had seven opportunities - such as Sam Robson - in front of him, while Nick Compton got nine.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The only criticism one can gather, was that England was Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean began - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity now lies in the past.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a man who shot, which I appreciate.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
He is an X-factor-cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge Square, which hit us very much.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
He must be at least given the same opportunities as those in front of him, but, of course, this depends on the team in the United Arab Emirates.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The idea of Moeen in addition to Cook, which would receive an extra spin Bowler and four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I do not see why a man can't beat, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a hell of a guy of cricket players.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is not a number 3 for them, and there is no difference.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
My former teammate Justin Langer played in his first 38 tests at first drop, before he emerged in 2001 as an opener.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He has managed three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Zafar Ansari is in the squad as a back-up spinner, and he has impressed me as a young man in my limited dealings with him.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinner who raise their hands, and the coaches have opted for youth.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
He will learn a lot on this tour.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the trial games could be a champion.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, because he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Paul Collingwood is coming to the white ball-stage of the Tour and brings energy and a strong commitment to the environment.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I have always felt that he is created for international cricket competition as a player or a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Sometimes, new voices in the dressing room bring a breath of fresh air, even if the messages are consistent with the above.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Some people will not agree, but coaches and Teamaufsteller do not determine the timetable.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And you must bear in mind that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Such decisions are taken not blithely.

Hilarys struggle was still attractive.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his supporters and members at its closing session on Monday evening, according to all reports.

<seg id="33">
Whatever the rührselig bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news-discipline remains in the era of TV around the clock, important and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.

<seg id="34">
It is true that Cameron is not a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy, anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.

As with its ambiguity to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC will start a campaign for secession - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try to find at home, in particular, a sense of their superiors.

Why should Paris or Berlin, wasting political capital - they have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?

Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by criticizing the evidence used in her report on e-cigarettes from Public Health England (PHE).
</seg>
<seg id="4">
PHE published the "principle" report last month, and describes him as "a comprehensive review of the evidence."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But some researchers have questioned the strength of the data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
An editorial in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the basis of "very windy," founded on the PHE his main conclusion.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations are based on "stone or sand."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape Motherwell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "a fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They said that the public expects that the assertion of PHE, that "the current best estimate is that around 95% of e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine-containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, previously the managing director of British American Tobacco (BAT) have asked for an independent study.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
He also signed the references of BAT in a sustainability report to public health, they said.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to receive funds from a e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding, which he previously reported to have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which are also an industry funding provided in the paper.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in the field of tobacco control.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco industry led by PHE.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The research work of the group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
However, none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the PHE report.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that "so far, there is no evidence that e-cigarettes act as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers were" premature.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that it was already responding to the claims of BMJ.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
He said: "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
One in two life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes, in comparison, are small, but we have to continue to study the long-term effects.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Nearly 80000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System £ 2 billion per year.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Through the clear presentation of the current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.

The BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, he said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in solid timeframe against the most popular shows of their rivals and channels such as BBC4.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After the BBC's Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had been trying for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come into contact with the BBC.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes or broadcasts, which were also shown clearly by not subsidised rivals," said Johnson, the House of Lords Communication Committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, what I believe in the medium or long term is not a good idea, you should at least take his production on programs that others do not make or commission.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They send out The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to achieve the broadest possible support for their future.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The idea that no one else would show that this is a joke, it is ridiculous, of course it is nonsense.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Johnson said: " I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be financed without subsidies.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public service television.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC at all.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Johnson, a contractor for the series, led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give back what was the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like EastEnders.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes on BBC4 should go, " where one cannot fairly judge the audience, but they can fulfil their tasks, and they argue that if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcasting fees, " well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that nobody has ever seen. "
</seg>
<seg id="18">
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see them.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
On the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: " I call on you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value here.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Of course, you all think that we all think that for £ 150 per year here gets a great value, but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150, wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform, educate and entertain "."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take a leaf out of the publicly-owned television stations in Australia and Canada, change it to "inform, educate and entertain."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
On the issue of partnerships, said Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and alliances with the commercial channels, in order to make everything available online.

' Sonogenetics ' brain cells can be controlled by sound waves
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Scientists have bred worms with genetically-modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sonic pulses for human hearing at high frequencies, in order to be heard.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The impetus to work through the activation of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels, which react to ultrasonic waves.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Read more on this subject: the research and writing brain activity with light
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The researchers said that the worm showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The blisters, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The enhanced ultrasound waves on structures, the TRP-4 called ion channels, and found some of the worms in the cell membranes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, as a report in Nature Communications.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In order to create ultrasound-guided nematodes, genetically-modified Chalasani wear the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the Mikrobläschen and transferred to the worms, where they switch on the modified motor neurons.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a cutting-edge tool that allows scientists to neurons with pulses of light and off.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics might have some advantages over this technology.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In contrast to the light that revealed in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain has to be low-frequency ultrasound waves unimpeded tissue and can be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We believe that with therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the angezielt human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Eight golden rules for students living in residence halls
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Eleven years ago, when I pulled myself forget 19-year-old in a student dormitory, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the strained smile of those who I have offended - and the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The indentation in student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is tempting to chatting, telling people where you are coming from, whether and where you have taken sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you love "to be honest neither Marmite nor hate, because seriously, guys, it is just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I am in my room."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Do not breathe.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
And help others to do the same - you questions and you show interest.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It distracts the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like, in contrast to those with whom you do not talk, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Let people.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The rooms of people often turn into drinks receptions, film-night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people get dressed up and her underwear.

Referring to this: do not forget to start at the university with a relationship
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Introvertierte received a harsh treatment at the university.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room-to-room walk-in culture, which is friendly and socially responsible and can lead to life-long friendship.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to leave, so I get the energy back, which I have used for the interaction with you."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
You try to knock on when a fellow students of sociability is exhausted - and send him a text message.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Speaking of knock: just do it.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a door is not closed to an invitation.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
He saw a couple of things.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Close friendship through baking.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
As you begin the university at the height of the back-mania, is the knock on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate of brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950s- "welcome in the neighborhood, I have baked something to you, and please smile now when I ask you a few personal questions."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Offering homemade goodies is a good way to make friends.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and perhaps end up associating your face with a delicious surprise.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Badly mixed up clumps of flour, sugar and fat mean that people are asleep, when you knock on the door.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Of course, the hoof is a theft of chicken, but it is the capture of a drop of Milchs for your tea too?
</seg>
<seg id="28">

Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot resident definitely is not your future Ehepartnerin, you at least try to persuade your abdomen a little common sense.

Row houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "not only need Wohnhraum refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I am showing how you can still build cheap and good," says the 44-year-old in an interview
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Thousands of refugees are piling into the housing market.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The entrepreneur Mark Gildner believes to know how rapidly cheaper housing can be built: it builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Mr Gildner, many refugees are piling into the housing market.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
What solution do you offer?
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Markus Gildner: the mass housing in containers or gym has no sustainability.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
For the people to remain a big part here.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Given the influx of refugees, we will need enough housing in the next couple of decades.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
A very banal, three-storey townhouse is the solution.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Gildner: a terraced house requires less space.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
It facilitates the integration.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is different if you accommodate people in apartment buildings.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum-seekers.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Each unit has two bedrooms, one bath, a kitchen and a lounge.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It may be that many refugees will say again, there is peace, I will go back.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Then the houses can be easily rearranged to suit the requirements.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
What are the costs?
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Gildner: the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184000 euros, without a plot.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
This is manageable.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Six months of construction has lasted.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
This is a good thing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The building codes have complicated their plans?
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Gildner: I was planning my project properly.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Particularly difficult, it always makes the looming sword of Damocles Sonderbau and parking regulations.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Creepy.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It is still assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house of three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
Only in the cities is that they have the space.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
How did the locals react to her townhouse project?
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Gildner: there were those who have accused me of creating luxury premises for asylum-seekers.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
What is definitely not true.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But you do not tighten up the competition for affordable housing?
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Gildner: but it is true: we had a building boom over the last five years in Germany, but were built luxury homes that can afford a little more.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
My project has the message that ordinary people need housing.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Not just refugees, but also the single mother, or the low paid.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
I will show how you can still build cheap and good.

It was sympathetic at first glance, when the Felstehausens years ago Frank Muller and his wife became familiar with Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, currently their specialist training in Verdener hospital and next year will also be in the practice.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"We have always had in mind that Mueller would fit nicely into this practice," says Dr Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"When it was ready, I have just phoned them."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The couple liked the idea of Muller to run his own practice in Asendorf.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"The closeness and the constant contact with the patient are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Mueller.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"We want to get to know the families over the years."
</seg>
<seg id="13">

</seg>
<seg id="21">
"It is possible, therefore, to be released," says the 38-year-old Silvia Mueller-Gongoll.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
After the renovation, the rooms look more modern.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
We will offer more ultrasound tests and long-term- and stress-EKGs and need one more surgery.

One positive side-effect of the practice of takeover by Frank Mueller: the pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
If no successor had been found, they would be gone too.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Anyone who visited Müller appointments, incidentally, looks to continue, especially in familiar faces: the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced for 30 years.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"In the beginning we only had two rooms," recalls Ursel Felstehausen humorous.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
A little bit of sadness they feel after a long period of time.

Croatia, Slovenia is considering "corridor" - denied
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow incoming refugees to travel further in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly create corridors for the refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Just saw this Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana, though.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The border with Croatia, however, is already heavily controlled as an external border of the Schengen area.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
As the Minister emphasised, Slovenia wants to seal its borders to refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"Every EU member must complete its obligations, otherwise the system would not work," said Györkös Znidar.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday, entering the Eastern border crossing Tovarnik/sid to evade the registration.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Croatian police could pick up in the nearby corn fields.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
According to local media ever since meeting in the Croatian Tovarnik constantly police vehicles with new refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
It was mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.

Moreover, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected towards Croatia, Croatian and Serb told media on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was to advise the people to take certain routes: "neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus carrying around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, other coaches would be expected.
</seg>

</seg>
<seg id="26">
The inmates had been traveling all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 km away from Serbia.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so we told the police that we have to come here," said one of the refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
</seg>

Croatia: "comprehensive ways to border control"
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Croatia's Minister of Interior Ostojic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the case of a large influx of refugees on plans for possible emergency situations.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
He mentioned details, but he pointed out that Croatia was a non-Schengen member "comprehensive options for border control."
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Consider strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Slovenia is one of this since 2007, the EU's partner since the country is consistently a testimonial as to the standard of border controls.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
On the Serb side, behind the Hungarian border fence remains around 300 refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the previous night at the border Horgos to Röszke.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely blocked.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Whether the remaining refugees now want to continue to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to reassure Mittwochfrüh for a look at what is happening in Horgos: he does not think that the debates on alternative routes for refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Currently, it would not be very large numbers of refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
They could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Rates of immigrant workers to dangerous - alternative routes -
</seg>
<seg id="43">
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, where alternative routes are drawn in through Croatia.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not dangerous: in parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war, Croatia still not cleared minefields.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of minesweepers was sent into the border region.

FedEx earnings mixed financial-reduced prospects for 2016
</seg>
<seg id="2">
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The company also said that it plans to hire roughly 55000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
At this point last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in the Premarket trading 45 minutes prior to the opening on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
FedEx Corp. said, to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 $ for the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Analysts expected, according to a poll by FactSet 10.84 $.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The reduction comes despite the prospect of price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which are collected from November.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The company said that it expects that earnings over the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of the growth in online trade will increase.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides "solid returns, given the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The plans for the holiday jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire between 90000 and 95000 more workers, roughly the same number as last year.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Earnings per share amounted to 2.42 $ per share, just behind the $2.44 $ per share, the twelve inquired of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, the turnover in its express delivery unit brought to stagnate.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
In the last quarter, revenue at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In the Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell 3.85, or $2.5 percent, to 150.15 $.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
On Tuesday, they closed with a loss of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.

At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve strategists spent two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Looming above them at one end of the ornate two-storey sitting room wall is a picture of the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximise the US employment and keep prices stable.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
And this third mandate of the X-factor could be in a decision that is too narrow to predict them. It will be announced on Thursday that if the US economy is ready to start from the unprecedented stimulus by the underlying short-term interest rates close to zero since the end of 2008 to be weaned.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Although most of the economic data show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate on government bonds, and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will primarily be the most important, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"But I think that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what in themselves the financial market.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have this week predicted an increase in interest rates.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The financial markets, however, expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance of a hike.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rate, except that the strategists softened the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped to 228.89 points, or 1.4%.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It would be surprising if the Fed would raise rates at this point, " he said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
If they do it, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Other experts argued that a hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Yellen had said during the spring and the summer that they would be required this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress, expect an increase in the rate.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market was solid this year.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels that the Fed sees as full employment.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
And while inflation has been consistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"The economy can sustain higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
But the financial markets around the world begin to twitch at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in May by more than 16% from its highs, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curtail global growth.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The market has rebounded slightly this month, with the Dow now at almost 10% below the high of May.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
For the Fed representatives influence the market turmoil of the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not have emerged over the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would tighten the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
He now predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"There are a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it technically should not be involved in their decision-making.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But in the end, the Fed has become monetary authority in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The mere hint of the then leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could tighten its monetary expansion "," triggered confusion around the globe.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"Their decision-making is more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management firm Envestnet, Inc.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction on financial market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for an increase in interest rates, cited decisions over the years, as an example.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," said Lacker.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The Fed should only aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse first, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the interest-rate setting Bank of England.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
"They certainly do not want to fall into the situation, in which she has fear of a rate increase, because the markets are excited," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should jump ahead of the time.

Brazil's Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to educate women in a shocking way, about how important good nutrition while breastfeeding is. It is doing so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on her breasts, which are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Breast milk is composed of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates to give the babies all the nutrients they need in order to build a strong immune system.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.

Exceptions to the new Bernrieder sports hall
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Bernried council approved the Bauantrag for EUR 2.3 million in expensive sports hall.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
And he made an exception.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The roof should be flat for the solar system.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The plans for the long-awaited Turnhallenbau on Bernrieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: in the recent City Council meeting, unanimously approved the draft Bauantrag without much debate.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Previously, the board decided, among other things, a request for a baugesetzliche "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The "exception" dealt with the permission of a special form on the roof structure.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
According to a "roof with non-modified First and roof survives."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Background of the planning is the proper use of the roof space for solar panels: "we have a wonderful big Süddach together," mayor Josef Steinberger said in the meeting.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The "liberation", in turn, went to the roof slope, which - unlike in the construction plan prescribed for energy reasons - is less than 10 degrees.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The volume of the hall is reduced significantly.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
A "liberation" was necessary because the construction plan on the roof slope does not allow for "exceptions" - and the Bernrieder council in the more restrictive rules on exemption requests.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In the Turnhallenbau, however, it is not a recurring project: "we do not create a precedent," said Steinberger.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Turnhallenbau at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Costs are around 2.3 million euros.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Grants are expected to come from the school and grassroots sports funding.

Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The situation on the German housing market is tight.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable home.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The social housing sector is facing a challenge.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The fights on the German housing market have long since begun.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
They compete with low-income citizens in the last affordable housing.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, need to be built by 2020, every year, 400000 new units.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Associations Alliance ' social housing '.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
For comparison, this year will be held in Germany to 260000 units.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Thus missing 140000 homes.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Refugees are no longer obligated to the first three months of their stay to live in a reception as accommodation for asylum seekers.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Many then come across the housing market and in the long queues at a rental apartment.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The German Federal Statistical Office states, however, lived in the last year, less than half of all asylum-seekers.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only because of the increasing numbers of refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The study also draws significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Germany is pushing a housing deficit, which grows from year to year.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Currently lacking in the conurbations around 770000 units, Matthias Günther complained, author of the study.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Many workers lived in big cities are inevitably in WG-rooms.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Young adults were involuntary because of the downturn in the housing market in the longer "hotel Mama."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the big cities, the number of square metres per head for the first time in recent years has fallen again.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In order to solve the problem, the alliance of "social housing" suggests a fresh start.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
With new incentives to boost social housing.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and the property taxes on a temporary basis for subsidised housing.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Moreover, according to alliance of attractive tax relief are needed.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The support programme for refugee accommodation of state bank KfW plays well in cities and towns already.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
A good week after the start was already more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
</seg>

The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are pretenders.
</seg>

This option also connects with some billionaire who wants to become US president.

Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.

And performs well here.

This will be recorded in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire.

The New York City with the Föhnfrisur is many in the village of winemakers on the Wine Route.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Some of the 1200 people on the ground - dozens of corners is related to him.

His grandfather came from Kallstadt in Pfalzen: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.

<seg id="11">
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel on Trump.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"I think that is the kind of exciting, but also in its Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The native Kallstädterin has filmed a humorous documentary about the town and its famous offspring, including next to Trump, the Heinz ketchup family.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is in "kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so to speak - by saying that he would also be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The king of hearts, he has not brought it there.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
While there is respect for the power of the family, but also tend to be of the opinion that Trump is "a bit of a big mouth," said Wendel.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Strangely enough, the noisy nickname, Kallstadt in the vicinity, "the Brulljesmacher" - to high English: the show, she says.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So Trump comes from the village of pretenders.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Trump's success story began in 1885, when the grandfather and later opened a restaurant for gold rush in the US.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Foundation stone of the real estate company was the first piece of land purchases in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: their desire to return permanently to the home failed, the Bavarian state, which then belonged to the Pfalz.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He did not include Trump, because he once was hewn down without permission, the director of the Institute for Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the movie to start.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
He is the grandson of an ' illegal immigrant '.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the offspring.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall in order to deter illegal immigrants.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"As the noise, it is not so appealing," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant cousin Trump ("Grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The retired vintner sees the Americans rather aloof, "he is always so effervescent."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Does he think that Trump is?
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"I can't imagine," says the 72-year-old girl.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"He has never taken care of Kallstadt."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The Pensionswirtin Veronika Schramm mentioned how many Kallstadter, a descendant of the Heinz family during a visit to the church organ donated what was generally a good thing.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"I can't imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old girl.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
You think it would be better if he did not win the election, because "such radical views, I do not know if that is good."
</seg>
<seg id="35">
If those who had been at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots, as he had, "he would never arrived there."
</seg>
<seg id="36">
"There are interesting issues than him," says vintner daughter Sarah Bühler.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
And as a President?

The last three agree: the Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Secrets revealed?...
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly, apparently, who will win The Bachelor.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The woman, Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally landed, was wrapped in the greatest secrecy.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
And none of the three remaining girls certainly will not disclose whether it is the one that has received the final rose.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But when we are with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, the day before from three to two, eincheckten, you may have inadvertently given a hint about who will be the winner.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Sam Wood keeps his lips until the finale on Thursday firmly sealed
</seg>
<seg id="8">
All three women have turned to lyrical, exuberant about why Wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
However, if the question is asked, "if you do not, who should get Wood's final rose?" Their answers could be the spoiler, who won the hearts of the Bachelor's degree.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski cited both quickly - except himself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been from day one, a simple relationship with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"From the moment when I walked into the house and noticed (Sarah) and Sam energies, because I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"Sarah is with both feet on the ground, there is so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They feel nice and comfortable with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
From their point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood could be "the One."
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now fully adjusted to him," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
And when she was asked to choose whom to Wood, if they do not, because it was puzzling.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"I do not know if I can say this," she said.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between Snezana and Lana.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams that fielded questions after his impressive open training at the end of last year.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers, and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Some trainers have Hayne banished for the rest of the game on the bench, when he lost a battle, as did the Aussie rugby league convert on his first punt-return on Tuesday when a 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
But Tomsula confided to his man and gave Hayne's next opportunity to take a punt return and also in the running game for a violation of Reggie Bush.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Tomsula also revealed his true colors in the dressing room after the game.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Instead of grinding his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the game.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catches and to care for the next game.

Hayne left after the Fumble go the playing field and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM, that he could imagine no worse start in his NFL career,
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"That was a thing that just happens, you only cares about the next game, and that is it," said Hayne.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Hayne compared the blunder with his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass resulted in a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.

However, overall it was a great experience for the 27-year-olds.

Party and Group chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-autumn exam in large wall city facing a severe crisis of Bavaria's schools when there are new teachers, not for the many new students: "we need at least 1000 additional teachers in order to maintain the schools on the brink of collapse," said Aiwanger.

4 people were killed after police fire rubber bullets at protestors in Nepal
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal, after the police fired rubber bullets into a crowd of people who marched against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital, Katmandu.
</seg>

Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, chief district officer, said that more than 1000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.

Mr. Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and fired into the air before they returned to rubber bullets.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, which are known, that they can kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution that would reduce their political influence.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.

At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since 10.

Google launches Verdoppelungs-donation campaign to earn $11 million for refugees

<seg id="2">
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign, which raised $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, because they are fleeing from war-torn and impoverished countries.

Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation appeal on his blog.

Rather than let a manager make the announcement, " wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee, who has fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.

But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family desperately for help.

The donations will go to four nonprofit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million at google.com/Refugee Relief will be doubled to $11 million.

Weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabetics.
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight-loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.

Weight-loss-surgery or obesity-surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Over the years, obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proved effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is regarded as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.

<seg id="9">
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

Used for the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare the two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric sleeve education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.

In the meantime, the BMI is among those who received non-surgical treatments for diabetes, roughly the same at 29.

In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who undergo obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.

Although the new study does not advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.

"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.

Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take seriously the weight as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.

Four-fold rise in use of hand disinfectant by children in last 4 years
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Poison control centers in the US, reporting on a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12, swallowing heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, the Georgia Poison Center.

<seg id="3">
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases rose from revenues of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12, the poison control centers report of 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"Children are increasingly coming to these products and, unfortunately, a certain percentage of them end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a trial in the social media.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Videos on YouTube show how young disinfectants drink only because of a cheap experience.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Young people are supposedly disinfectants mixed with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a hard drink.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Younger children can be lured by attractive smells of disinfectant.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"A child does not think that this is bad for it," said Lopez.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are the ones who are perfumed.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents, which are very attractive to children.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Particularly in infants can cause a few splashes of alcohol poisoning.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison emergency center at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
So, you would not drink whisky, but these people hand disinfectant within reach of children, and if children come out, then it is a quick way to much alcohol.

Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently captured four splashes of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school, was brought into an emergency room for treatment.

Nhaijah lallen, their words and was not able to go when they arrived in the emergency room.

Doctors monitored them over night in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, because the girl was killed by alcohol and had met with the head, said Ritchey.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It could have been lethal for my child to be.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfecting wipes and hand disinfectants lie beyond the reach of the child.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
About alcohol poisoning, a number of disinfectants have been associated with deaths.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
In 2013, two women died, women in Ontario after the swallowing of the hands of disinfectants, which contained a toxic ingredient not declared.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contains methanol, a lethal solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as an ingredient.

In January, three students plan the fourth grade in the state of New York to poison their " nasty " teacher, by interpreting anti-bacterial products around the classroom, " so it is possible for a police report.

Why I am going to be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma

A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is brought to death.

If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator's gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses for his death.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed to.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
As the day approached, I began to worry me.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
So, why should I do it?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It would provide a unique perspective.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.

<seg id="16">
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.

<seg id="19">

You tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants, and you get access to it.
</seg>

I complained to her.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
She admitted that she "would have put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.

<seg id="24">
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
He tells me not to write what I did, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
I told him that he can remove me from their list of witnesses at any time.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
But he wants to write that one international reporter was present.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
When he dies, he thinks that the public will help the movement against the death penalty.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Kim Bell, a reporter of the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I have made.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
I do not want to go back to all the details.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
I can't say for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
His actions following the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the crime.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
I feel sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
I believe that his execution is wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
I can't really claim to be objective.
</seg>

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy is fighting back against rivals due to claims of fighting ring
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tackles of his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites of the NRL.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referee the Storm players "wrestling" with his team during the high storm-victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his team's final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, he had called the game a "textbook example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "good" in the rings.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Bellamy's Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were the only tackles on their "contact us".
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading trainers at his team confident agree with him, because it meant that they were concerned to be smitten by the Storm Team.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"It always reappears - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling matches, when they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
I can guarantee that in the whole year, we have nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but we have changed our contact with Tackles a real focal point in the last six weeks, and it has done for us, the trend.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Trent is there now for three years, and he obviously has a great team to work out, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
It is funny how it always reappears at this time of year.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Bellamy has Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and attacked his mentor, recalling that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how her game was exciting, " said Bellamy.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
I remember that in 2010, St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take care of a shit about shit.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But he now has a team that can play and what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
That is the ball game that you play, if you want that type of player.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He made that statement in 2010, now that he wants all of his type of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
I am counting on greater trust, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Six weeks ago they would not have thought of us when it came to the Big Game.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
The game of the Broncos was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the outcome? 16: 12?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Our game was 20: 18, there were two other attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting?
</seg>
<seg id="24">
For me, it is the game plan.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a single phase.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The Storm team won this weekend, as they have the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park, the ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.

JVA Berlin-Tegel: five-square-metre cell are inhumane
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex-prisoner of Justice Correctional Institution Tegel, which was right for months, in a small cell.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to monetary compensation if they are housed in small cells.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
According to the magistrates, the people affected can even hope to have money if they were just a few days locked up in the tight spaces (Case 1 BvR 1054/01).
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It was an ex-prisoner successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Justice Correctional Institution in Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a solitary cell with roughly five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not closed off.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer now been released, had been moved to a larger cell.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Although his term failed lawsuit liability because of the substandard conditions of detention against the city of Berlin.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the court in Berlin and had the case back for reconsideration.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They see the human dignity of the man.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The supreme court will now decide on the amount of compensation
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Even if, for legal reasons, from the period in question, only a few days in prison days are crucial for the compensation, whether a compensation claim, it said.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Otherwise it would be "a decline in the legal protection of personality."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the compensation money.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The constitutional courts in the past have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
They spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Human habitation is the multiple-occupancy of a cell without a toilet, according to a decision by 2011.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday, the Constitutional Court of Berlin, which was certified in November 2009 a subhuman housing a prisoner in a parallel case.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Then the plaintiff was more than three months between 15 to 21 hours a day in a row, as in the case of Karlsruhe.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
The Berlin prisons were also in the last couple of weeks in the headlines because of a lack of staff.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
That is why prisoners are repeatedly trapped 23 hours, the aggression is rising, even unto blows it should be because of the tense situation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
According to the judicial press office 21 posts are vacant in Tegel Airport due to lack of talent, 19 out of 2016.

Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "we are creating the"
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
What will come to Germany?
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Around 800000 asylum-seekers are coming to predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany, according to the Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) in Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do that, and we do it."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
What is coming to Germany, gives the following overview.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Needed for different forecasts of between 350000 (estimate of the Bundesbauministerien) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and the next five years.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
That is almost twice as much as previously built homes (250000).
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Dramatically, is the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties fall: 60000-80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments are also applying for refugees.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD), therefore, wants to double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80000 social housing per year and would have to invest for the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Scientists are in agreement and Bundesbauministerin that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, is the assumption that 55% of the Geflüchtete in Germany can be employed in the long run.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticized Claudia Walters, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The integration of refugees is crucial, but whether they can find work in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation of the host society, but also for the self-esteem of the immigrant population migration, says researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In Germany, there has been a political turning point, according to Thränhardt: the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of the work.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
While there has been a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
In society - is also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view that refugees should be allowed the faster access to the labour market.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A big hurdle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
So far, there is not yet a sufficient number of general and vocational language courses.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Studies also show that most jobs through personal contacts.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The construction of networks therefore believes is the royal road to work integrating Thränhardt.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to the Kita, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "for the displaced parents, it is very important to keep the family together," said Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Nevertheless, the family of the benefits of Kita, to convince the administration distributed hand slips into different languages.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Should greatly increase the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
In the countries students are prepared for the classroom without knowledge of German in welcome.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
But they are not always informed by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school of administration.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or Geduldete study - the only exception has been Berlin Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU), but now has abandoned its position.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Studierwillige!Studierwilligen refugees could facilitate the access to higher education.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
For refugees with a residence or outsourcing, no tolerance for the asylum seekers more power when they begin their studies.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The latter have basically no Bafög, because they do not fall within the circle of bafögberechtigten people.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Tolerated refugees have so far lived in Germany for four years, in order to be entitled Bafög, from 1 January 2016 to shorten this period to 15 months.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But this funding gap must be closed, Steffen call noise, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
The students should be given immediate Bafög.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The state should Islam gradually give the same rights as you have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion relationship develop.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, a professional to take care of the newcomers.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
The rights include duties.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
It also includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany have "forfeited their right to live in Germany," he said at the Bayerische Rundfunk.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
He suggested that the Basic Law to be translated into Arabic.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Integration in the future will be much more so than today, to be an issue for society as a whole.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
It will also have to change the majority society, more pressing, the elimination of discrimination and racism.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
But it very slowly learns how the NSU-murder series showed that the police and authorities have systematically ignored the racist motive.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Equal opportunities for all: what immigrant organizations and interest groups do not need white Germans have been demanding and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention Germany commit to remain peacefully in the next few years if the country and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Germany in general is able to supply the refugees so far expected medical doctors, says President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
"As regards Man- power and capacity, we create," he told the Tagesspiegel.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
However, this extra money needs to flow into the system.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery, calls for all comers in health registration cards.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
Services rendered could later be charged with the federal states.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
And in the long term it is highly questionable, so many people being fobbed off with limited capacity, the catalogue of the asylum seekers ' performance.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
Otherwise, make the doctors above all to create the language barriers.
</seg>
<seg id="59">
Until now, Berlin has shown health scientist Thea board, migrants are less informed about their illnesses than other patients.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
Not only in clinics, in doctors ' offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted, calls for it.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
Would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency room.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
And with another diagnostic.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
For example, among refugee children there are considerably more unprocessed disability, and the young people it is about HIV awareness.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
With the other partial symptoms German doctors came forth from their training but clear, says Montgomery.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
"Parasites or tuberculosis infections are not so difficult to see." And as for the shortage of doctors, perhaps even by the refugees, relief in sight.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
In order to be permitted, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the German psycho therapists chamber (BPtK) insane: most are suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
</seg>
<seg id="70">
A recent study by the University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child trauma arrives in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder is unwell, among other things, on so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation, and fears of death.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
Other symptoms are sleep and concentration, strong Schreckhaftigkeit and emotional numbness.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
In order to prevent the symptoms of chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
</seg>
<seg id="74">
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees a psychotherapy.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services make an application for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually lasts several months.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
In addition to the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
</seg>
<seg id="77">
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.

Manege invites you to dream

<seg id="2">
With the new staging of "passion" of the Circus, Dean draws on the traditions of the circus arts.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The goal is to attract people of all ages in the thrall of amazing acrobatics, Tierdressur and unparalleled entertainment.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Now the circus invites Dean in the riding school on the tile-Hanság dreaming.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"Our passion is the circus."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Dean, animal teacher and junior officer.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"Passion" - under this motto is the current staging manege.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
For more than 33 years, the Circus is in the hands of the family of Dean.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The gift to the Begeistern family is therefore in the blood.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"It is important to us, the people of their daily routine and herded them along for two hours in a completely different world," said the 27-year-old junior officer.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Cocktail rings with world city flavor," says Director Reinhard Dean calls his concept.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
50 cities on the tour almost 3000 kilometres can now experience this atmosphere.

"The animals belong to our family," said Stephanie mother, Brigitte, Dean.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Shortcomings in the behaviour of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Stephanie Dean also takes this stance: "it is not good for our animals, it is also not good."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy stroking each.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"The four-legged artists," as they are affectionately known, will be able to read all of the wishes of the eyes.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
We want to work with the animals with them and have fun.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The animal does not feel comfortable, it is not even in the riding school.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
The First Commandment is: good for the animals.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPony stallion and a zebra filly, the Dean family is proud of.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a corral and nothing has happened.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," says Brigitte Dean.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the riding school, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus for Dean.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
For each visitor, so something is likely to be involved.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Dean: "no matter whether five or 1200 spectators, we always do our best and are here with all my heart."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The Circus invites Dean from 17 to 20 September at 5.00 p.m. and 8.00 p.m. every day to his ideas.

Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds the wrong speech in parliament

Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell at the beginning of the year by a panel down the stairs.

He was uninjured, but the video of the event spread quickly on social media.

Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30000 jobs
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25000 to 30000 jobs as part of the restructuring and conservation efforts in the service of the company.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
HP will later this year split into two publicly traded companies and away from the computer and printer business from its faster-growing corporate hardware and services operations.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The expected job cuts will lead to a load of more than $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"This restructuring will allow for a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have to support a broad and extended portfolio of stores, the company's transition to a new style of business," said Whitman.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.

Arsenal's captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wils here
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Wenger stressed to Brentwood here that it was not until September, and if his rehabilitation goes smoothly, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
This optimistic scenario already means that Brentwood here surely will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The great shame in this current problem is that here the Brentwood last season had ended badly after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing during the early season.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"This type of injury is not career threatening," said Wenger.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It is a bone that does not heal well.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This is not a major issue.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This was just an accident.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It was not in connection with his ankle, or with the injury he had before.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but, as Wenger acknowledged, there is also the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
It has also developed a nasty pattern.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different pathologies of Brentwood here since his debut six years ago.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He played in only 65 games for arsenal 157 league over the last five seasons.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, which most violation days.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you must strengthen your body and fight to win," Wenger said.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs, Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"I am trying to keep the balance and the players who need a little breather," Wenger said.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the most intimidating effect in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The stadium on Tuesday evening was shattered by an earthquake, measured on the Richter scale 3.2.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Wenger believes that Arsenal's lesson has been learned from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European cup triumph with his management.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It has never worked for Arsenal.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business, to be realistic.

<seg id="31">
We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.

Festive friends: the comedy show, which gave us a serious lesson about male friendship
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The absence of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, has now become even more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15-year high.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It was the main cause of death for men aged 20-45 in the UK in 2013, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
In an effort to tackle the problem, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of the culture in question, which prevents men to seek help when they need it.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Friendship is at the heart of the battle, in order to meet this challenge.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
A recent study on more than 2000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer a high percentage had plenty of friends with "healthy" mood, his chances of recovery are doubled.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But, of course, you have to have friends, a friendship can work.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In the age of communication through social media, with its focus on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Our digital lives, the need to appear strong, vital and successful, doubled, even though in reality the isolation.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, reputation, social status, all at the expense of the intrinsic values - our inner yearning for personal development and friendship, which has an impact on our mental health, much deeper.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And, like a video game creator and billionaire recently declared that money really cannot buy happiness.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been turned on its head.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Each character has been defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the nostalgia of Ross after Rachel - all of this came from the knowledge that men can relate to in any case, even if they are holding back, often to fully explore their feelings.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and even murder are endangered, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The men who contact us, often do not feel able to speak with friends.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The old adage "I get on with it ' has a huge impact, as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness, if one speaks openly about problems."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Friends is one of the shows, which comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term management mechanisms.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendship.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
So much to help my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the celebration of the day completely redesigned scenery, then why are you not your friends for a drink with in Central Perk.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Or, even better, if you are sitting in Starbucks alone someone around, you give him a smile and say hello.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
You never know what difference your friendship could make.

Is Di Maria to PSG help to crush Malmö
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his strike against Malmö.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helped PSG to pull over to Malmö.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept track, as Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, who brought the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions, before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61 minute, a Kopfballtor scored.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk, also in the group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, since they are not the only qualification for the knock-out rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team and the club, with whom he began his illustrious career back in 1999, replaced.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2-0, our opponents look to cause problems and relaxed, even if there are certain things that we have perfected over the course of the season," said Blanc.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
" This is a good omen.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have another one or two more goals. "
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team, which could hold over the weekend, a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the first league, but he was hammered by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested that why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before he graduated to Johan Wiland over nicely in the long corner of the net.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
However, if someone believed that PSG would be a great victory, was disappointed.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off, in order to reach that stage, appeared in Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was strung with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle of a difficult opponent.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, of the far post to Kevin Trapp went over in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Instead, PSG himself sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least from Ibrahimovic, who has dropped in no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria has turned into a revolving pistol, which was drawn by Wiland in the 52 minute at the post over...

No diet-fruit - mangoes contain lots of sugar
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
But who wants to take care of his slim line, which is often discouraged by them.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Because mangoes contain relatively high sugar sucrose - above all.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The healthy exotic fruits are nonetheless: they are stuck in B-vitamins, vitamins E and C. In particular mangoes contain much vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Anyone who eats the fruit, thus supports vision, immune system and metabolism processes in the body.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasantly smelling.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The shell color alone says nothing about how the fruit is ripe, green mangoes also can taste delicious.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
They should be stored at room temperature and eat within a few days.

Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Jesus was painted with the (gold-plated crown of thorns) is one of the main works, Otmar Alt for his Bible.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
Klaus Alte Post has written the introduction of updated and Biblical texts.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
At the beginning was the word?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now with splendid images.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has formulated 150 motives of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes of the 75-year-old has won - but what is not synonymous with "funny" pictures.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
On the contrary, adapted to the specific issues that may seem pretty bleak.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
About three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible-project, for which he has made a subjective artistic choice from the many issues of the "book of all the books."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Cycles are created that address issues such as crossroads, plagues, bids, or the Our Father.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
He is fascinated by spontaneously several partners: this applies to the Lutheran publishing house with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publishing house, with its emphasis on art books.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Alte Post, who has dealt with the Bible on the basis of the painting.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
He has interpreted the Bible by Otmar Alt-selected and so to the present day, "translated into current correlations."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old paintings.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
They are embedded between the original bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist, here expressed his own personal thoughts on the particular situation.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The jewelry has golden cover letters.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This allows the 75-year-old girl twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
This is a high degree of intimacy.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Emotions were ultimately led to the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"As the education ever happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"I have tried to cope with this, to me, perhaps with the Lord," father.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
His second concern was to restore art in fast-paced time to give more importance: " the perception of visual worlds today is influenced by advertising, and it is loud.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Symbolism is being suppressed.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Artists have a different desire and bliss to show things.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Pictures have always been somewhat mysterious, and are not decorative.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to the images of "fall", they seem to be discovered, and what power they have: "the picture is looking for his counterpart."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Klaus Alte Post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation, "has always been" to be a lover of Otmar Alt art: "I like how he lives with his pictures."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It did not look old, the Bible to fully comprehend, but for the important issues, even mysterious.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"This was not a collaboration on a level playing field," says Alte Post: "this is about the images, the text only." Was a picture-Bible.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
For Hans Möhler of Luther's publishing this work is to find an invitation to deepen "his life and freedom."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otmar Alt pictures speak for Möhler, both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Some of the originals - paper and canvas paintings for the first time - will be presented in an exhibition that will open on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt-Foundation.

Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in the accident
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The head of Europe's largest software company, Bill McDermott, has lost the left eye, according to several reports, by a crash at the beginning of July.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
In the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the US, he had died after midnight on a water glass, which he had worn in the left hand, the "Wirtschaftswoche" reporting on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"He is bleeding to death, was almost powerless, then dragged out into the street - that he has told us so, last week," quotes the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
</seg>

But McDermott could look into his work.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"At the beginning of October, we gather in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.

<seg id="7">
The 54-year-old manager and was "fully operational" at the meeting.

"I am totally there for SAP, in my job."

McDermott typically fluctuates between Germany and the US, but since the summer, he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.

The players will also be missing in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7.00 p.m./Sky), the league leader of the Football League.

"Unfortunately we were not able to rely on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Whether Reus on Sunday in the Bundesliga's top match against Leverkusen will again be the BVB coach: "we expect a return by him to the training on Friday."
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Given the high burden of its professionals, Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only at the Reus-position.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.

Robot cars: government wants to lead the way for Germany
</seg>
<seg id="2">
Germany is supposed to be following the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The German cabinet on Wednesday decided a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investment in digital infrastructure.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion, said Dobrindt.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, including at the IAA, along with representatives of the industry.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The strategy document of the Transport Ministry, among others, stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The new technique is currently testing a test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
So the driver will be saddled with "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Thus, Germany, for example, international efforts to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10% to 130 miles per hour.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The federal government also wants to push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far includes only the people as a driver.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The automated driving leadership is increasingly the car, the driver is turning more and more to the passenger.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras, which record the environment and process the data in seconds.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on highways by 2020 will be technically possible.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Nevertheless, be driverless vehicles on public roads "until well after 2020."
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The added value in terms of driver assistance systems and the high value of automated equipment in Germany, the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The digital network of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician Transport Sören Bartol.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The question of liability in case of an accident and the safety of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Even the Germans, however, see self-driving cars - much more skeptically than French or American.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A survey presented on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will be travelling in the next ten years, 32 percent expect in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe this.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In France, 21% of respondents expect to 2025 with autonomous driving cars, 33% in the US.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In any case, the car drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
According to a survey of the association Bitkom Digital would agree to only seven percent of the control over the entire ride on all roads.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
On the motorway could imagine the traffic flowing as much as 15 percent, 45 percent in the closet.

Jewelry as a fashion niche instead of curtain - Plauener lace
</seg>
<seg id="2">
In the past it has been in the long stick machines in Plauen to make yards.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The embroidered fabrics and lace were done for clients, for example, processed into blankets and curtains in large quantities.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Now that alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of the fashion Plauen lace.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Instead, the fashion is important.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In the early days of the Plauener lace fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Reinhardt cites some examples: in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and in regional folk costumes.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The so-called vintage fashion, which is similar to past eras, form a growing potential for orders.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
They already make up half of all contracts with us.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Fashion Plauen lace is a member of the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery, along with nine other companies.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
They are only allowed to wear the label.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of its sales are broken apart.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Private shops and wholesale, there are almost no more.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Our products reach the customers in this way.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
The mass-produced goods will be cheaper nowadays manufactured in Asia and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Also schwächle export, up-to-date to Russia and the US.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
So, ample reasons for new routes.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The industry association also tried to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "since this year we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Reinhardt said: "it also relates to the materials used."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, something you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It will take time and courage.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
It creates a tension between the freshest ideas of the designer and the companies that need to think economically, " says Schmidt.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
That is why an existing design will often vary only slightly, in order to maintain a customer base.
</seg>
<seg id="26">

In an elaborate process, they shaped the pattern in silver.

"Many people in the region, identify with the theme of Plauener lace - young and old," says Reuter.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
It also delivers in the USA, Australia and Finland, especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.
</seg>

EU plans to double the mercury limit in carnivorous fish
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and thus consumers expect a significantly higher doses of the nerve toxin.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The consumer organization Food Watch, which is before a proper working paper from the EU, harshly criticised the plans: "the risks and side effects missed industrial and environmental policies are passed by the full force of pregnant women and infants," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of Food Watch.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
According to Wolf Schmidt should be raised to the limits of the nerve toxin for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
However, large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury that, on the basis of the current limits, around 50% of the catch may not be sold.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After doubling the limit would then be just 14.5 percent unsold.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
In exchange for the easing of the EU, according to Food Watch wants the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of mercury to 0.1 milligrams per kilogram.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Food Watch but described it as a "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually so low, that they should stick to the planned limits already.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious distraction, that alone helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Mercury is a heavy metal is highly toxic to humans, which accumulate through the food chain, especially in carnivorous fish.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
That is why the Federal Government warns that "very small quantities can cause damage to the nervous system of unborn children."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The German Federal Ministry of Environment said on its website in relation to the current maximum levels but that a "health risk to the general population" was not to be expected.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Mercury is mainly through the burning of coal into the environment.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The German coal-fired power plants emit, according to a written disclosure of the Ministry of Environment, the Green MP Anna Lena Baerbock more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount of emissions in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The concentration of mercury in fish in roughly the same, the Rhine and the Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded," the "mirror" was quoted in the paper in March.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Last year Europe-wide included warnings about mercury in fish are already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
