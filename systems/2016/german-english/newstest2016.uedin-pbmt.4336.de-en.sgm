<seg id="1">In an emergency call professor to have shot his girlfriend admits</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb with a slightly quavering told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb was it important to stress that his "sweet dog" but still live and probably was excited, and he said that the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss, a handwritten note, scribbled on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that Lamb, who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, 300 miles already went to the school grounds, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office was shot and killed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University Police Chief Lynn said Wednesday that university staff the shooting at 10: 18 a.m. heard.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb made the disastrous emergency sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took her own life when the police einkesselte him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shootings at the university, the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators at both ends of the state released details, as well as revelatory as students and staff who knew him, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they were happy with his teaching.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt Lamb himself had mentioned in a book written by him, in which he spoke of the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, praised Lamb, said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he was at the end of the academic year 2014-15 had to do with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had the Delta State University, asked for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard, for it does not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, of course, but "there was something in Mr. Lambs idea."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that can no longer answer Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="23">After fleeing the campus police later found Lambs when he could back into Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested Lamb killed, selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">2009, Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of approximately 12,000 and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He received his doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla hair tone said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was then the women swarm.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted away when he was there, "said hair tone, now 40, and in the suburb of Brandon Jackson resident.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were apparently some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In an emergency, Lamb said, "I've killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">You had a dog named Lightning, with them in the brick house, located on a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was in order.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O 'Steen, said that they had been divorced 15 years ago, but have remained friends and had a daughter, now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally devastated," O 'Steen said of his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O 'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played guitar.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss, as he and Abigail three years ago at a summer fair.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played a gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O 'Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a barman and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he and Lamb Prentiss Night at night 5 September saw for the last time, after Lamb, his guitar and harmonica playing stopped in front of a sparse audience had ended.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no indication that anything was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were laughing and joking with each other the clean up.</seg>
<seg id="51">I think they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first-year seminar program, specialising in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">At Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community participate in a candle-light ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, the university choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" while singing.</seg>
<seg id="57">The classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are trying to encourage our students to return," said upon.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and Lamb described in his emergency Prentiss as his wife, but there is no indication that the two were ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to draw Donald Trump from the top echelons of surveys, it has not worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump with a double-digit lead, and some begin to seriously ask what it's chances for the nomination of the real-estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011 by Rick Perry's leadership to the rising Herman Cain, none of which also won only one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth economy now see Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers, which indicate that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity ratings have revolved around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, showed a poll by Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans, the real estate mogul was positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, there were 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these figures are in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac-vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as the GOP candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates the same enthusiasm about how Trump (43 percent say they would be "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio, with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters said they were "dissatisfied" or "angry" when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, the candidate said.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans see Trump's temperament is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely known for his bombastic and insulting statements is criticized, 52 percent of the Republicans, but Irish voters that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number applies to the first pre-election state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent said that he does not have the personality to carry out his duties effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If they put their scholars hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN / ORC poll from last week, four out of ten that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change from the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past, not the clearest crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this stage in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry will win the nomination, compared to only 28% were for the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, it appears that a large number of GOP voters, Trump's campaign as a plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts suggest that the splintered field probably contributes to Trump's leadership, while the anti-Trump-support to more than a dozen other candidates distributed is diffuse.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping the majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has a 13-point lead over Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio 14 points before Walker 15 points, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would be the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say that they have made up their minds.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, saying that they have given their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trump's strongest competitors at the moment, the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have made up their minds are twice as often for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then, Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" who called immigration, was the lynchpin in the public discourse on 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the bombastic language of Trump crucial Hispanics from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the Neuorientierungs-efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday said six out of 10 Republicans, with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">So, as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it will also do Donald Trump apparently.</seg>
<seg id="56">The frustration with the government climbs to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, now accounts for around half of the support from Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans said Monday in the new ABC / Post poll, they want a political outsider rather than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll by the Des Moines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa's Republicans frustrated with the Republicans in Congress are "dissatisfied" with 54 percent and 21 percent use extreme caution "angry."</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP before</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system proposed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private mediation services for disputes between corporations and governments should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system that is in its operation significantly more traditional dishes.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to set up a system where the public trust," stated the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, responsible for the idea.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede has plans to introduce the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">By TTIP is the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans for reform of the current arbitration specifically see that the EU countries and the US together independent judges to select a new investment law.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should come in equal parts from the EU, the United States and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">A second instance is also provided for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow to make appeals against judgments.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the procedure involved agreed among themselves on a referee, an appeal against their sentences, there was not.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the discussion of the past few months is clear that citizens of the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice cannot be trusted, "said Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, she wants to work for an international investment court.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, for example, there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.</seg>
<seg id="16">The especially large corporations required investor-state arbitration (ISDS) is considered as one of the main reasons for the strong opposition in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbitration courts are criticised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system through which businesses can only compensation at the expense of taxpayers, nullify national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the first comments described anti-TTIP organizations like Campact, the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="19">Criticism that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA) was especially.</seg>
<seg id="20">The German economy, State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission has to say on the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers have drawn up.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitration is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French government has welcomed the plans of Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European business association BusinessEurope warned to limit the possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by it.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) will be completed on Wednesday remained unclear.</seg>
<seg id="27">The negotiations since mid-2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally a framework should stand for the agreement as early as the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This date is considered to be no longer tenable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time, and for the first time with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will gather for the first of his six questions set out shortly after noon, with his performance of the media and probably the Labour MEPs will be examined closely.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said that he could skip some meetings to leave to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence, criticism from a number of Tory most recent provoked and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they rely on differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin Charles says that political differences within Labour "pile up" after Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour changes present to the whole idea of a limit to remove altogether.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans, the cap of £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn is the fifth to be Labour leader, David Cameron, the Tory leader, in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House, is facing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions for Mr Cameron, he has more than 30,000 comments were made.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will both repartee "and refrain from arguing with the barbs and has instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will represent him, if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak occasionally, and that he had contacted John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he is out of politics in the style of a "Ditherer-theatre" to remove, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons, and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature, and needs far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash tries, the IGA stores from Aldi-march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million to defend Aldi-invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media, as well as through events such as Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo from DUNS Borough in IGA stores samples distributed and shopkeepers, the cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash further details of his defense strategy, published on September 29, when the wholesalers for food, drink and equipment-Strategietag conducts its annual investors.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake, with South Australia and Western Australia, nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and higher profit margins than the IGA network Metcashs Oststaaten generate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Purchasers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the Oststaaten.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, as Morgan Stanley analysts believe that Aldi 12 months after opening its first markets will snatch away around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players, but mostly independent retailers will take away sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">In a report published this week shows that the estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, IGA retailers $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016, could lose.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that in the next year, Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in food and grocery store and the quantities on Metcash Metcashs high fixed-cost base could be around $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time is losing market share in the Metcash Oststaaten, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund managers today Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade, Metcash.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to publicly respond to the comments of Mr. Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a director of Metcash has contacted Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS is market share since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, the operational debt reduction while pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler is resisting and invested more than $150 million to date and sale price with Coles in hundreds of products every week, align and IGA retailers to improve their stores by faster-growing fresh food to improve and better selection of private-label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs Chief Executive Ian Ferrin says that the price adjustments and store-rehabilitation programs to drive up and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 for the first time in four years, will return to profit growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the president of the Association of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks," came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee, with Harrison stated: "Kyrgios beat Wawrinka would have to, and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racquet after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group of thwarted, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind an artist's Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing that I'm quite ereifere is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was embroiled in the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has broken a racquet when he Krampfes due to a lost in the US Open, but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken, Thanasi and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he was in the US Open have behaved extremely well, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around, he has a great family around, and I think he was treated a bit too strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works extremely hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never been a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trained hard, he is in good form, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios at the important precedent, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as an integral part of a long-term return to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios], Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to explain to him the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closing the border, refugees back</seg>
<seg id="2">Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stuck all who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints and built tents and settled there.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations grew.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "open the borders!" And screaming insults against the Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some had food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister, said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were returned, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It must take place in the coming days, talks with Brussels and other countries, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge, they expressed their hope that finally, next month, or until the end of the year, an agreement was reached that EU states further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, would resume.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union, to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary, however, was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they were able to seal off roads and speeding up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race, the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, have been used.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the economic refugees are arriving in search of a better life and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view very much at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, making the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence which the government along the southern border with Serbia was build to a crime. These laws also give higher sentences for convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Because of the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Procedurally, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, national-security adviser to Orban, said that 45 people authorities while trying to cross the border caught, 15 others were already penetrated deep into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">You come across as they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and the committing of crimes are accused under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.</seg>
<seg id="28">Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians a small office opened in a metal container, in order to process the data from people and a crowd of people pressed to hineinzudrängen there.</seg>
<seg id="29">20 managed to get it, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll, halved</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground to her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously, while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for president, the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters in the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll showed Clinton with a range of demographic groups, while Sanders has achieved some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a wide lead among women and moderates, but these canopies have diminished.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under 50 years has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton still has a big advantage among the older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support them with some reservations and a further 15 per cent they would only support because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support them.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprisingly, that Clinton's current supporters are particularly thrilled by it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton, only about a quarter would enthusiastically support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be President (13 percent) and that they are the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Clinton's supporters, including her relationship with Bill Clinton (9%).</seg>
<seg id="21">Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the vice president casts a potential run for president, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although one-third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If the Democratic primary voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice, Biden is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">For more than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton is ahead of Sanders by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden, a second is by far in this measure, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics with voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and with strong leadership.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, Clinton's strength is in the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), and 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters in the primaries, Clinton, Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State will continue to be asked, are the most Democratic voters in the primaries is satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about one-third are satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion on this issue was in March, shortly after the problem came to light, divided.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her was even worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them among registered voters overall, only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62% of voters do not believe it is an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide see also Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush are doing best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority of Sanders looks rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood, with the death of a Baruch College-newcomer charged</seg>
<seg id="2">Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual bullying in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, to be filed murder charges against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 to brutal and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged, and have been repeatedly attacked while he tried on a frozen field to reach a goal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">But you had the time to change Deng's clothes to googled his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, in order to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood were fundamentally about what Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and legs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," said Douglas Fier Berg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Congregations, and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, as bond yields will rise, and the economy is sliding into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">What we know.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came in just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial system.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, however, market participants could see that all the fuss was exaggerated, perhaps because of a rate increase.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money, "Julian Jessop, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level, the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a look based on historical trends, as some sectors of the economy might react:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes could make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">Once it arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a tendency for asset returns of 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be undermined, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happened after the Fed's interest-rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is mostly over the last 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike, pretty flat over the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle, and thus increase the yield begins to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote interest rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most remarkable is that GDP is near its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank's nominal GDP stood at 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent, only a few, and we expect that this will continue in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed just 1.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants throughout the year on a rate hike by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC increased could approve during this session, the futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all have cycles increase from 1950 to today in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade provided," according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession, the record was 35 months, and there have been 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was also volatile, because the market is anticipating a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if the change their strategic direction.</seg>
<seg id="33">With bond yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause bond yields between longer and shorter closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets are already in Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US, will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as the financing of their debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "stocks tend, three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality (by an average of 4 percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of the pure stock games consumers also will benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts are divided on how soon that will happen.</seg>

<seg id="5">House-colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, a leading member of parliament and new claims increased pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private sector do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the BBC bosses that public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems to be - I use the word" verdummen "not like - but it seems to turn on Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The bathrooms smelt just under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only "imitate what is already on the market, said Mr Bingham.</seg>

<seg id="16">Earlier this year, Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that should be working harder to engage the audience argued the BBC, as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.</seg>

<seg id="12">It meant that more people were able to shop online, and that people were able to do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.</seg>

<seg id="1">The decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve</seg>
<seg id="2">The world is watching, if the US Federal Reserve in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision to make, whether for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rates will be raised or not.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half who only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-field and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start," said Angel Ubide, chief researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="6">The US economy is in a relatively good performance, trillion will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of inflation.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.</seg>
<seg id="8">It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move.</seg>
<seg id="9">The decision is at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced</seg>

<seg id="1">Shooter at the Delta State University has left a letter of apology</seg>
<seg id="2">After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and later in the day before he wrote his colleagues shot and killed Shannon Lamb - a note to say that we do him "sorry" at the first murder and he wanted to know "can make it disappear," authorities said on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, a lecturer in geography and social science education at Delta State University, the emergency number at 10: 00 on Monday morning calling upon</seg>
<seg id="4">And said that he had shot at someone and killed someone.</seg>
<seg id="5">Lamb said the emergency call centre staff that the police had to send police to his home.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said, "I shot my wife last night," and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" in the house, but no one is "upset," but probably will be excited.</seg>
<seg id="7">The police asked the caller for his name, but he was not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.</seg>
<seg id="9">When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a hand-written note from Lamb, 45, said: "I am so sorry, I wish I could undo it.</seg>
<seg id="10">I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me. "</seg>
<seg id="11">After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night, as police umzingelten him.</seg>
<seg id="12">University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, of course, but "there was something in Mr. Lambs idea."</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite reports on Monday, the Lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence of a" triangular relationship. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Prentiss has been described by Shawn O 'Steen, who testified that they were married about seven years, as a "good man."</seg>
<seg id="15">The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.</seg>
<seg id="16">O 'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated."</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that her daughter "Prentiss were absolute best friends."</seg>
<seg id="18">Prentiss was working online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.</seg>
<seg id="19">Knowles said that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning met, for about three years ago with Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles</seg>
<seg id="21">The police said that Lamb phoned relatives at some point on Monday to tell them, "he will not go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When police heard him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night Lamb drove his car, fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>
<seg id="23">Lamb was in the spring of 2015, from Delta State University with a doctorate, as his life Lau explains on the website of the university.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, then it is very difficult and great plays, and then this happens.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.</seg>
<seg id="10">He wept.</seg>
<seg id="11">I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.</seg>
<seg id="12">I hope that he can play again this season.</seg>

<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, but a summary of the film version of 2012, the new characters and details added to the relatively short text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and the air is a commodity, is hoping for a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree," reads one.

<seg id="8">As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text proposed by Cameron reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax's film, on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar, hears an unnamed boy, as the local environment by the greedy, trees cases, Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name Lorax, Hock, schnurrbärtigen nature, "that" speaks on behalf of the trees, is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, The Lorax not 20 times in a row, read to a child.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still difficult</seg>
<seg id="2">Against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad that was selected for the tour of England, is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">"I would not rule out a victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side may have less than three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting and fielding, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars of 2012, only a youthful, positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">In related news: Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex was.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, that led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">Hopefully, if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he is not so good services, and this does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to his character, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven chances - as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only criticism I can make is that England was Jonathan routine first began in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex disaster comes in, and he is a man, and I have.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-Factor-cricketers in Yorkshire we saw early in this season, when he 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch was what hit us.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of letting Moeen alongside Cook beat what an extra spin-Bowler and provide four Quicks would receive, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a man could not beat, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious bastard of cricket players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has managed three hundred runs immediately and not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People might look at his statistics, an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman out, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood for the white-ball stage of the tour and will bring energy and a powerful presence in the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he was on the international cricket competition is created, as a player or as a coach, and how he had Mahela insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes, new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with the previously said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but coaches and team director do not determine the timetable.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp = Brexit (British exit from the EU) are gaining popularity as the economy by the year 2017 is in the doldrums</seg>
<seg id="2">David Cameron's half-baked Neuverhandlungs Strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU, with each day deeper into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn for leader of Labour and the TUC, because Europe was renowned on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, it is now, and not always through their own fault, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disruptive changes that they are not usually like that.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual meeting that it may not be them if they threaten social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also have Dave and Georges Selfie-agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb summits and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photograph of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, an outwards-looking Britain inside the EU tent wants - "Let us not just with France," says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals came to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, such as lunchtime of those like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand and Kohl (14) (16 is in the overly long).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks back on his re-election or its replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a declining force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-Britons, whose energy should be used more, Scotland's exit from the UK - to prevent something they may not want to, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">So maybe some of these ministers are planning even deliberately unhelpful comments, SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to accelerate the process of Brexit, thought my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and the EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did during the referendum in 1975, inspired by Tony Benn were not, however, that our entry in 1973, with a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can be weak to Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunists, who has a reputation as an EU "straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all its craziness Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">This included a medley of tax-fearing-rogue, phone-hack of foreigners and the pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tony Blair really thought much about it, but noted that if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distributed bananas to distract him, rather than on his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum, because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU Constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, he opened the back door.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never forgiven him. "</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, of me in Westminster on Monday for a friendly slap on the back - I told him that he had no time for me to waste need - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may be, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win over the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I express it politely - in development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye-tendency and the wilder climes of Tories Klein-Engländerismus can say yes to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is to admit it, "said Hilary Benn, not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television this week, when the Scouts fought in it, not that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father on television what, disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his Cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilarys fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But struggling to remain "under any circumstances" - Benns - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC and his colleagues told delegates after all the reports on their conclave on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the mawkish bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that even he has moved me - news-discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock, and, above all, in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allows him to Labour's support in the referendum campaign to keep a foregone conclusion, as McDonnell, it said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with its Bennite Belagerungs-economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of small difference a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with all its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC is launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">A government-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, said researchers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined in the Lancet, by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes are used as evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE report published the "principle" last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data, and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," reasoned on the PHE his main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations "on stone or sand build up."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">You said that the public expects of PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling are based.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened to make a model of a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by a variety of nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose CEO is earlier by British American Tobacco (BAT) to have an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed the credentials of BAT for public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding, which he previously after reports from tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received, she added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied, but that includes several well-known e-cigarette-champions, some of whom even an industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting, also took the tobacco-of PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research group "significantly," recognizes that there is a lack of hard evidence of the damage of most products on most criteria, "wrote, McKee and Cape.</seg>
<seg id="18">But none of these compounds or restrictions in the PHE report discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Cape well said that the allegations of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way of smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that it was responding to the allegations by the BMJ earlier.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smokers dies of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but we still have to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the health service £2 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">The clear proof of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, are we fulfilling our national jurisdiction.</seg>

<seg id="1">The BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used in order to make the kind of programmes that are not by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in solid window against the most popular shows of its rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do, Johnson said that he was six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts which are clearly non-subsidized rivals would be shown," said Johnson, the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the licence fee, which I consider medium- or long-term is not a good idea, you should at least give its production programs that others do not.</seg>
<seg id="8">Send The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show, this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be funded without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a programme, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes are what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows such as Eastenders should sell.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes to BBC4 "should go where you can measure the audience not quite, but they do their job, and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees go," Well, of course, we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">You put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">The broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think that for £150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who are £150 is a lot of money, whether that is true wonder, because they don't consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform, educate and entertain. "</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should be on the public television channels in Australia and Canada are an example of this change to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by explosions of sound waves.</seg>

<seg id="6">Further on this subject: Read and write brain activity with light.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sono Genetics, where ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures, the TRP-4 called ion channels in the membranes of cells, some of the worms are found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">By ultrasound-controlled nematodes to create genetically modified Chalasani, the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sono Genetics may have some advantages over this technology.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through unimpeded and tissue in the brain from the top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could be on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I show how you still can build cheap and good," says the 44-year-old in an interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are pushing on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project terraced houses for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the people here are to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In view of the refugees, we also need enough housing in the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very facile, three-storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs less space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is different when you are among the people who live in apartment buildings.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What is the cost?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Took six months of construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">The building regulations have complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: Planning, I have learned through my project.</seg>
<seg id="27">Particularly complicated there is always the looming sword of Damocles and expect the pitch regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy. "</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still assumed that anyone who creates in a terraced house with three apartments, needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities of the lack of space.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents reacted to her terraced house project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: It is true that we have had in the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message that the ordinary people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how you can still build cheap and good.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what it is.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analyses.</seg>

<seg id="7">This could potentially mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it through the streamlining of the updates less likely, and it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install it once the process is completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade, or is located near a battery charger, so that the battery is loaded.</seg>

<seg id="26">The inmates were all night, around 500 kilometers away from the Macedonian border with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">You wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">So could it actually to observers already predicted shift of previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a nearby stretch a little further.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control."</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's Interior Minister what had previously said that his country had prepared in case of a large influx of refugees, the plans for possible emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">He gave no details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member "comprehensive opportunities for border control '.</seg>
<seg id="33">We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia this since 2007, the EU partners provide the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serb side about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports they had spent the last night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings and Horgos Backi Breg continue to be blocked completely.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees want to move now to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos: He thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not be very large numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="41">It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Aides to migrants - dangerous - alternative routes rates</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps where alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless, however: In parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx mixed results, financial outlook for 2016 reduced</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for the year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to about 55,000 seasonal workers hired for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shares fell more than 2.5 percent in Premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than its previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts were expecting, according to a poll by FactSet 10,84 $.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which are collected in November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it expect the result compared to the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of the growth in online trading will increase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides "solid earnings given the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade, into account."</seg>
<seg id="11">The plans for the holiday-employment was a day later than those of rival UPS announced the plans to 90,000 to 95,000 more workers, roughly the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the predicted twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Revenues rose by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12,23 billion.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has in recent years, a decline in international priority shipping, the sales in its express delivery unit to stagnate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales increased by 29 percent to ground transportation, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages, and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result due to higher labor costs in the freight business fell.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell to $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June.</seg>

<seg id="1">At their most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table, to decide whether it is time, for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Loom over them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting hall there is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: The US employment and keep prices stable here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision, which is too close to predict, it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 to be weaned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rate for Bunds to increase - if only by a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they" observe, Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty is to wait around the global market enough justification to continue," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what insecure themselves in the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg, have forecast a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">The financial markets expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates at this time would be, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it does, "they would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets, so that they do not end up in panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had in the spring and early summer said that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the rate expected.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation is below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world together zuckten late last month, after China had devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its all-time high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now down by almost 10% lower than in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Fed representatives influence the market turbulence, the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is not the main concern of the Fed, so technically they should not be involved in their decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end, the Fed has become monetary authority in the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed's monetary expansion could "narrow" triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, representatives from the Fed can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks and experts advise to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making is "more art than science," Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy, said the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should only include aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee, said the interest rate set by the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You will certainly not get into a situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets" are concerned, Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not believe that they should jump ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The council approved the Bern Ried Bauantrag for 2.3 million expensive gym.</seg>
<seg id="3">And he made an exception.</seg>
<seg id="4">The roof for the solar system may be flat.</seg>
<seg id="5">Plans for the long-awaited turn buildings at the Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In a recent City Council meeting, the finalised Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.</seg>
<seg id="6">Previously, the board had decided, among other things, a request for a project "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the "exception" was about the permission for a special form of roof construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">So should a saddle roof with non-concentric First and roof over state "will be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">Background of the planned use of the roof space for solar panels: "We get together a wonderfully great southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the "liberation," it went to the roof, which will be mandatory for energy reasons - other than the construction plan - under ten degrees.</seg>
<seg id="11">The volume of the hall will be considerably reduced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Therefore, a "liberation" was necessary because the development plan allows for the roof no "exceptions" - whereby the Bern Rieder council usually proceeds with exemption applications rather restrictive.</seg>
<seg id="13">The physical structures, however, this is not a recurring project: "We are creating a precedent," said Steinberger.</seg>

<seg id="9">Some in the 1200-residents-site is used on dozens of corners with him.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from starting in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kallstädterin Simone spiral shot a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think that this is somehow exciting, but are also impressed in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply," says Simone spiral.</seg>

<seg id="19">So Trump comes from the village of a show-off.</seg>

<seg id="24">Trump was the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of the descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>

<seg id="33">"I can not imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="34">Do you think it would be better if the election if he does not, because "has such radical views, I do not know whether that is a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were at the time of his grandfather in the US calling the shots, it would have been like him, "he would never even got there."</seg>

<seg id="37">And as President?</seg>

<seg id="7">Sam Wood is keeping his lips sealed until the final on Thursday</seg>
<seg id="8">All three women have ruminated on lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man, and his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study may take at least five years.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data takes a long time to get something to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods in order to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">You reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, have obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient, but most studies have been carried out by people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal is between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, researchers used from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007, they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI was among those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who have undergone surgery, with 36% of the total diabetes disease and at 28%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group disintegrated completely diabetes compared to only one percent, with only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results were in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, remained stable at around 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reflect reduced the mortality rate in five years, so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes (million vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival advantage for surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study was in obese people who are subjected to an obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years of dying - compared to a group that tried conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study no advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed, Blackstone said, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take seriously weight, once the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is hard, really hard.</seg>

<seg id="4">"Children are becoming more common on these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them will end up in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant, while some do it to impress their friends or because of an Estonian in social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show how teenagers disinfectant drink only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young people are supposed to be mixed with disinfectant mouthwash containing alcohol to get a hard drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by attractive aromas of disinfectant.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child does not think that this is bad for it is," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectant) are the ones who are perfumed.</seg>
<seg id="11">It disinfectants with textures, its orange scent, the children are very appealing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particularly in infants just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is" highly concentrated alcohol, Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency centre at the hospital of the University of Kansas, the broadcaster told Fox 4 in Kansa City.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, you would be standing around a sip of whisky, but people make these hand-disinfectant within reach of children, and if children are involved, then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four splash of strawberry scented hand disinfectants in the school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, two times higher than the threshold for an adult is considered legally drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor and, in the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lallte their words and was not able to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had alienated, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary, Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN said.</seg>
<seg id="21">It would be fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has encouraged parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants should be stored out of the reach of children.</seg>
<seg id="23">About alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectant, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three of the planned fourth grade students in the state of New York to poison their "nasty" teacher by misconstrued antibacterial products around the classroom, "it reports a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banished them from their room.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police saw the foiled plan as "chatter" and disciplinary action by the school authority.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man is put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I am in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was made in January for the first time about his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day approached, I began to fear me.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to witness executions in the United States, and there are often more applicants than places available, a macabre lottery will be held to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whoever is selected, will observe it dispassionately.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS a friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I was not a witness and can be a journalist, so it will not be allowed me, a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "could have put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He tells me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter is here to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks that the promotion of the movement against the death penalty will help.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts, which I have done.</seg>
<seg id="31">I will not go back on all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective, I am going to see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters to whom you can turn to it.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claimed that stewards attempted to spy on him and threatens to end the racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claimed that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race-day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions, as the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris was that he could not explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to look like "high-hanging grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I was going to say nothing about it, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once, Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You know that it went further.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I'll go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would like to walk with my head held high, and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If they start to think, I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then I have to think about what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Previously, Moody's had the bomb in an interview with racing.com high let go that the Integritäts department tried to spy on his stall.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables," Moody said on Racing.</seg>
<seg id="15">You seem to believe that I am a cheater.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is the case, surely they should be on their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of at the time and it still is today.</seg>
<seg id="18">This should bring me to the view that it will personally?</seg>
<seg id="19">The RVL Hat behave cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps the people out there thinking that I am there.</seg>
<seg id="23">Maybe they have to give me my license and I run, and I have no doubt that what I say, think about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">This makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The levels of the trainer is to have the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he was "his license could throw on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for its preparation of the master's unbeaten Black Caviar, described the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied, which was against the rules.</seg>
<seg id="30">"It is against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I have to take the full responsibility for it, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.</seg>
<seg id="33">So it would have been last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It would have been all day yesterday, which was the case.</seg>
<seg id="35">But it was also so on race day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody with a three-month disqualification for the treatment to be confronted with the pack on race day, and opened an investigation into this matter.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">"We all understand that we need rules, but here they have gone too far," said Moody.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tack Ling his players as "agenda setting" of two Premier League favourites in the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees the Storm players "wrestling" with his team during the Storm's victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening have allowed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team after his team's victory in the final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night had made. He called the game a "poster child" for rugby league and said that the two Queensland is not "too good" in the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Tacklimg Bellamy defended his team and said that they were only focused on the tack-on their "Contact."</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading trainer on his team confident with him, because it means that they were worried that the Storm team to be beaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It comes up time and time again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling than they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have not changed throughout the year in our defensive system or the techniques, but we have made over the last six weeks our contact in football makes a real focus, and this has provided us with the turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is now there for three years, and he has obviously losing to a great team, so he is probably not used to it, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how it always comes up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy Bennett's idea has attacked the "exciting football" and his mentor recalled that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long" because of football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night game and how exciting it was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a boring team, and Wayne said that he would take a shit dirt.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially its young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his type of football - not every team two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt has, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build stronger confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought of us when it came to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm ROOSTERS achieved a higher score than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game of the Broncos was a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game 20: 18, it was two more attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Make or breaks are no points and exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it is the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they say to us, it means that we will be taking in a period still on it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cowboys or the quiet surrounding the Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park to receive Vorfinale. The ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="4">The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.</seg>
<seg id="5">You saw it, found the confusing messages and alarmed her mother immediately.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police took it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches, the terms of the search for indecent images of children.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it, because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and then "pretending to be a policeman, to frighten them."</seg>
<seg id="8">The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.</seg>
<seg id="9">He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that he did it to attract them.</seg>
<seg id="12">He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said that he wanted to see images of rape and murder.</seg>
<seg id="13">MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and weeping.</seg>

<seg id="17">Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg did not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no significant sexual element" in his crime was to be found.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred the verdict until October in order to obtain background reports on social work.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept for hearings on other outstanding cases in custody.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create the"</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What lies ahead for Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to absorb a million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination, given the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do it."</seg>
<seg id="6">What is in store for Germany, conveys the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Used to be, according to various estimates between 350000 (estimate) and the German Federal Ministry of 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is almost twice as much as previously (250000 homes will be built.</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically, however, is the lack of housing, especially affordable rental properties: 60000-80000 per year falling out social housing from the rental price, and the affordable housing will apply as refugees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double the funding, currently 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute: 80 000 social housing should occur annually, and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Agree scientists and federal minister of construction is that it must also give more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of the countryside can be employed in Germany in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them start, criticised Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also the self-esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift: The work ban for refugees on the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was once a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence requirement limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the view of society - is also due to the shortage of - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed for faster access to the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="20">A big hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far, there is still no sufficient supply of general and work-related language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The development of networks is, therefore, in the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration has noted that few parents from giving their children in day-care centres, there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent, "for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, managing leaflet distributed in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">The demand for teachers is rising due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by not allowing multiple schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In countries without knowledge of German pupils in classes to be prepared for the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="28">But they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from teachers who have a qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, Beate Stoffers says of the Berlin school administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception Berlin interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has so far but now has abandoned its stance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university.</seg>
<seg id="33">As refugees with a stay of reimbursements or receive no benefits under the current law more asylum seekers when they begin their studies.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter have basically no Bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to trainees.</seg>
<seg id="35">Refugees waited until now had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be Bafög-entitled, from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen crash, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.</seg>
<seg id="37">The students should immediately get Bafög.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">Islam, the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religions-relationship develop.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, the professional cares for the newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="41">To the rights and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="42">The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany have, "for her right now, here, in Germany, forfeited, he said in the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration in the future will be much more so than today, be a matter of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="48">The majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has, as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade, an anti-discrimination and a general equality law.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is very slow, as the spirits-murder series showed that the police and authorities are systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and which require international agreements such as the anti-racism convention, must become a reality in the next few years, if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to exploit their opportunities - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany was able to provide the expected refugees medically, doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="53">"As far as a power and capacity, we create that," he told the Tagesspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, this extra money to flow into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery wants to distribute to all arrivals when registering for health cards.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services could be charged later with the Länder.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long term, it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with limited services, the law stipulated that asylum seekers performance.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, the doctors make the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in clinics, in doctors "offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted, she says.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with a different diagnostic.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people go for HIV awareness.</seg>
<seg id="64">With some of the other diseases German doctors would come from their training, but clearly, Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to discern." And as far as the shortage of doctors, even through the refugees might be relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be able to practise, but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK) mentally ill, most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Anyone who is suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, palpitation and Todesängsten.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms of sleep and concentration, strong shock and emotional numbness.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic, early treatment needed, Munz said.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services can make a request for psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, officers or doctors who are trained for mental illness would not usually in the social services, decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to miscalculations, Munz said.</seg>

<seg id="2">With the new staging of "passion" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of the circus arts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of amazing acrobatics, animal dress and unique entertainment.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the Circus Probst invites into the circus ring on the brick Hanság to dream.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Our passion is the circus."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I can't imagine living without my circus family," Stephanie Probst, head teacher and junior leader says.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Passion" - under this motto, the current Manegeninszenierung.</seg>
<seg id="8">For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.</seg>
<seg id="9">The gift to the delight of the family is in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="10">"It is important to us, the people from their daily routine wegzuholen and for two hours in a completely different world to take," said the 27-year-old junior leader.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair," says director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.</seg>
<seg id="12">50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour this flair can now experience.</seg>
<seg id="13">The programme of the circus with talented artists from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="14">Awards at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown Family draws the audience with wit and charm.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also the Castillo brothers know their craft.</seg>
<seg id="16">With the heroes of the silent films it wants to include the Cuban duo loose.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lightness and agility - they identify with these words.</seg>
<seg id="18">Their humorous art on the mast to conquer the hearts of women.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except fascinated by many roars of laughter, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst with sensitivity and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="20">With the unicycle on a balance ball?</seg>
<seg id="21">For He Yuan, no problem.</seg>
<seg id="22">Snakes fascinate and scare people at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wang Lin from China is the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with its agility.</seg>
<seg id="24">60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The animals are part of our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stephanie Probst also notes: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."</seg>
<seg id="28">About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any pranks canvas.</seg>
<seg id="29">The "four-legged artists," as they are called, can be read as possible.</seg>
<seg id="30">We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.</seg>
<seg id="31">The animal is not feeling well, it is not in the circus ring.</seg>
<seg id="32">So the top priority: Good care for the animals.</seg>
<seg id="33">Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.</seg>
<seg id="34">The two animals have lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="35">"But then, all of a sudden, our little Jumbo, was there," says Brigitte Probst.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Zebroid is still not ready for the circus ring, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.</seg>
<seg id="37">So something for every visitor should be there.</seg>
<seg id="38">"One thing is for sure," Stephanie Probst says: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best, with all my heart."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 hours to his ideas.</seg>
<seg id="40">On Sunday, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thursday is a day for the presentation at 5 p.m., the prices are reduced.</seg>
<seg id="42">In addition, the show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack must be Goal.com</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger told Goal.com stressed that it was only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario means that Goal.com will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship will still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current problem is that the Goal.com had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then was back to his old swing found during the early season.</seg>
<seg id="5">This kind of "threat of injury is not the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that has not healed well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not linked to his ankles, or with the injury he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but also, as Wenger acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also developed an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases from Goal.com recorded since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, one of the two Premier League clubs, who have had the most injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain power struggle," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the sort that he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a little breather," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is unrivalled, even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal, the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope, with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends: The comedy show that serious lessons about male friendships granted</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to challenge the culture in question, the men to seek help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy" mood, had doubled his chances of recovery are.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, cut a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, of course, you have to have friends, a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of social media-led communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives are lively, strong, and to be successful, doubled, even if, in fact, dominated the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, reputation, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health is much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money really can't buy happiness.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character has been defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was notable for the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when football peering into comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross, Rachel, all of which came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telecommunications ministry told me:... "my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I get it" has a huge impact, as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about issues openly. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends of one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">You clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">So my objective outsider status over the phone to people in moments of despair, may also contribute to the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so if you visit this weekend, Comedy Central friends decided to celebrate the day with the completely redesigned backdrop, why don't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you are sitting around in Starbucks alone someone see you give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - for # friends fixed</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria is to help PSG to crush Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his match against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria is making its debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass in Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here's the match report and the response to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG, the French champions on the road, but then they missed a series of chances before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute a Kopfballtor.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal, and he was later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with which he began his illustrious career began back in 1999, changed.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy to win at home and away in the Champions League, so it is a good place to start looking back, 2: 0 to win, and to cause problems for our opponents, even if there are certain things that" over the course of the season, we still need to improve, "Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good omen.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the team back in Paris, at the weekend, a 2: 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league could hold, but it was in the fourth minute by Di Maria trumped.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man, the PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month was taken over by Manchester United, and he hinted at why he in Marco Erzähler TTI pass behind the Malmö-defense ran into it before he passed on Johan Wiland well long into the corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">If anyone believed, however, that PSG would achieve a great victory, was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage, joined by National Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield lined up a serious opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away at Kevin Music post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG gave themselves sometimes, with some bad passes and poor qualifications, not least from Inter, patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Inter, Di Maria turned in a low shot which by Wiland in the 52nd minute was turned past the post...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter left flank of Maxwell had been exploited.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into play, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz was the end result, keep low, before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, was later that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifying games are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game from them!</seg>

<seg id="4">The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played his part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 at Target Field.</seg>

<seg id="9">Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I want to finish this year," Simon said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is hard to throw in the Bullpen every game, and that is why I want to go very concentrated on the game.</seg>
<seg id="13">The designated Tiger pitchers Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, wrote his first since mid-August.</seg>
<seg id="14">It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with a crown of thorns (gold) is one of the main works, Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus old post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not in the Otmar-Alt-Bible, now with splendid images appeared.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has put in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes, the 75-year-old - but what is not synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, in line with the relevant issues, which may seem pretty bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">Roughly three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible Project, for which he has a subjective artistic choice from the many areas of the "Book of Books".</seg>
<seg id="10">Born cycles that address issues such as crossroads, plagues, bids or Our Father.</seg>
<seg id="11">So has he spontaneously several partners fascinated: This applies to the Luther-publisher with his theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler-Verlag, with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And since the author Klaus old post office, who has worked on the basis of the painting with the relevant biblical passages is especially.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt, and so to the present day, in the current context "translated."</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and a set of the artist, his own personal thoughts on the situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewellery cover has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">This allows the 75-year-old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were the trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine-Order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"As the education was" already with the cane, Otmar Alt remembers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I tried to come to terms with it, to stand by me, perhaps with the father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern was to help the arts in faster time to value: "The perception of visual worlds today is dominated by advertising, and it is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is out there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different pleasure and joy to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect, I am a dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images "fall" are allowed to work, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture is looking for his counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus post confessed on Tuesday during the presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible-in-Otmar Alt-Foundation, "has always been a lover of Otmar Alts art was to be:" I like how he sees life with his images. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not care to fully understand the Bible, but the key for him, even mysterious issues.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was no cooperation on an equal footing," the post says: "This is about the images, the text merely explained." It was a Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from Luther-publishing this book is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler (biblical) both the language of love and responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, on 15 November in the Otmar Alt-Foundation will be opened.</seg>

<seg id="6">He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 to discuss at the IAA will also meet with representatives of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The strategy of the Ministry of Transport, among other things, stressed the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">Testing new technology at a test track on the highway 9 is currently in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="9">So no additional liability risks being saddled with the "driver," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, for example, Germany wants to work internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only the people as a driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture and process the data in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, driverless cars on public roads "were not expected until well after 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany, the authors of the study estimate for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The digital networking of the cars to improve safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD politician traffic Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Germans, however, self-driving cars are sceptical - much more than the French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">On Wednesday one of the AA's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the inspection organization Dekra has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars over the next ten years will prevail, only 32 percent expected in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of respondents anticipate that by 2025, with autonomous driving cars, 33% in the US.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self-driving vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom only seven percent would agree to cede control over the whole driving on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the highway, it could present in flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well, one in four would car control under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures-shop of horrors: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63), on Wednesday in Munich presented an exhibition of his work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: Mannequins that look thanks to video projections frighteningly human.</seg>
<seg id="4">You have the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene - and that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture, because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the past it was bleached, it is" real, "Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The centre To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), on 18 September at the Kunsthalle der Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer's initial opposition to a show about his person has changed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, he had been against the idea, because: "An exhibition for me sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">When one dies, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had made previously in Montreal, Canada and in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger more Diedrich said.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the hard of work of the man who has made fashion history without ever training.</seg>
<seg id="14">The show is arranged chronologically, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total work of art, which was used in a lot of effort, in order to fudge the dolls, for example, has hired a stylist.</seg>
<seg id="15">The 14 tons of material, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot gekarrt after Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special highlight: A leather pants-outfit with a corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even horse animal old Teddy is on display in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He stands for the first, tentative steps of designer fashion.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was not a good student and) bad in football, he was attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">Playing with a doll, his parents would not allow him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The design of fashion he had taught himself later.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers looked at how Gaultier said in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later, I bought the then but of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first fashion show he did not pay for the models.</seg>
<seg id="27">You got nothing, but the clothes were allowed to keep.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewelry will net curtain - "top as a fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">Previously, it was the long embroidery machines in Plauen to make yards.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them with blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">That alone no longer works, Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of fashion tip Plauen explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the "top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt cites some examples: Lead in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and in regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Put all the so-called vintage fashion, which in past eras, a growing job potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche that is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, they already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen is a member, along with nine other companies in the industry association "lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they are allowed to carry the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales are there.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private shops and wholesale, there is almost no more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customers in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">Today's mass-produced goods will be cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively on chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, the export schwächle, after Russia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">So plenty of reasons for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer said of the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable manner."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow Berger of West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">It takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies, especially the need to think economically, "says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic pyramid top.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine uses small beads in some places.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Goldsmiths "champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became:" Before, I couldn't deal with traditional "top."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball head for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region to identify with the subject" tip - young and old, "says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of "tip.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and consumers expect a significantly higher dose of nerves gifts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Food Watch, submitted a working paper of the European Union, sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies with full force passed on pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wolf Schmidt, the limits of the nerve poison should be increased for large fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish Hai- or for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">Large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that approximately 50 percent of the catches should be based on the current limits have not yet sold.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit then only 14.5% would be unsaleable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return, the EU wants to tighten this easing in food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Food Watch described it as a "trick" because smaller Fried fish, such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the proposed limits.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction of small fish is therefore a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy alone, "said Wolf Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is highly toxic to humans, a heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain, especially in carnivorous fish.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the federal government warns that "even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Ministry for the Environment said on its website in relation to the current levels, but that a "health risk to the general population" is not expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury mainly by the burning of coal in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German coal-fired power plants to meet a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment at the Green members Anna Lena Baer wanted more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total issued in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and all the" mirror "in March exceeded" from the paper, was quoted as saying.</seg>
