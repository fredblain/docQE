Jarryd Hayne had a number of options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there are many other teams that sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose many and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers have Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench banned when he lost a battle so, as the Aussie-rugby league-Konvertit on his first punt return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
However, Tomsula trusted his man and Hayne was the next opportunity for a punt return, and also in the current game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also showed his true colours in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of to grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the game.
Of the many sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne's also special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey was encouraged, who advised him, forgetting his botched catch and the next game.

It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian entourage for his NFL debut had hoped for.
Hayne left the pitch after the Fumble fluchend and later told the Australian radio duo today & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he is no worse start to his NFL career could imagine,
"This is a thing that happens now, you care only about the next game, and that's it, Hayne said.
Hayne compared the blunder with his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-field officials to a try for Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27 year olds.
Hayne posierte for a photo with fans and holds an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
