XI urges to open up the economy more broadly for the world
The economy needs to be more open to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday, a group that has been entrusted with the management of the reform.
"China should commit itself to foreign investment and expertise to attract and improve strategies for business," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group on the deepening of comprehensive reform.
Fostering startups and further reforms will bring new momentum and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has adopted a series of policies, including a negative list to regulate market access, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state enterprises (SOE), private capital, and overhaul of the city's reporting system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created to identify the sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment.
The system will be gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources to ensure a fair business environment and the market open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers given to the businesses and ensure that companies decide how they run their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of international economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of a bid to open state-controlled sectors, other areas will be opened up to private investment.
"The government will change its policy towards foreign investment and protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services for them," the statement said.
In addition, it will be easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit, or the "Green Card" by the requirements and the application process.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practise their activities, and use professional judges and prosecutors, was also discussed at a meeting.
Also at the meeting, Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended, as has been reported in a statement issued after the meeting.
