Hammer artists invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns (gilded) is one of the main works that Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus old Post wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which is now published with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has made over 150 motifs of his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with bright colours and imaginative forms has received the 75 year olds - but what is not synonymous with "funny" images.
On the contrary, in line with the relevant issues that may seem pretty bleak.
Around three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he is a subjective and artistic choice from the many areas of "Book of Books".
Born cycles that address issues such as Way, plagues, bids or are our father.
Thus, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler Verlag, with its focus on art books.
And as the author Klaus old post, who has worked on the basis of the painting with the respective Bible is especially challenging.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt, and so to the present day, "translated into current relationships.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one set of the artist, who is his own personal thoughts on the current situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were the trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine of Order.
"The education was" already with the cane, Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to come to terms with it, in order to cope with me, perhaps with the Lord father."
His second concern is to bring the art of fast moving time to more important: "The perception of visual worlds from advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is out there.
Artists have a different pleasure and bliss to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images "fall" will be able to allow them to see and feel what power they have, "the image to his counterpart."
Klaus old Post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-old Bible in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "" has always been a lover of Otmar Alts was art: "I like how he sees with his life."
Alt did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but selected the key for him, even mysterious topics.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal footing," says old post: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains." As a Bible.
For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Möhler Alts images speak for both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation will be opened.
