Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult
On Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat and not on my card.
I would not rule out a victory.
Alastair Cook's side is probably less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin-player in the Batting-list, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a youthful positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.

The decision to leave out Adam Lyth, of course, is to analyze me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that this led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.
A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.
Hopefully, if he beats out other runs for Yorkshire, another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he is not so good services, and it does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to his character, is difficult.
Lyth had seven chances - such as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine.
Compton was only got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism I can make is that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan routine when Lyth in top shape - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex champions comes in, and he is a hit man, whom I have high.
He is an X Factor cricketers what we saw Yorkshire early this season, when he 236 against us on the Trent Bridge pitch achieved what hit us.
He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but of course it depends on the team's position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat alongside Cook, with an extra-spin Bowler provide and would receive four Quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man can't go there, and that Hendrix has already shown that he is a devil guy of cricket players.
Moeen may have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is a big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.
He has made three hundred runs immediately and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has really impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour, and brings energy and a strong commitment to the setup.
I always felt that he was for the international cricket competition is created, as a player or as a coach, and how he has Mahela insights that we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the previously said.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you have to remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results.
Such decisions are not with a light heart.
