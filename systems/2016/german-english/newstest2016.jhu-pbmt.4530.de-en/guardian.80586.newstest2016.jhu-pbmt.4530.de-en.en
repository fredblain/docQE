The BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that no other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, solid window against the most popular shows of their rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do, Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 have tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts, which also clearly not subsidized rivals would be shown," said Johnson, the House of Lords communications committee, as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I think is not the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others are doing or not.
Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show, this is a joke, it's ridiculous, of course, it is nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funding programs that could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a programme, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both own productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for.
I try to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows are what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, and in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like Eastenders.
Johnson said that the more public service niche programs "to BBC4 should go where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue when their hypocritical missions to justify a £4 billion broadcasting fees go," Well, of course, we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
Put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them.
The broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from that.
Of course, they all think we all think that for £150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who have the £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true wonder, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said very little about the BBC production would now officially classified as an education - he said that 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be on the public television stations in Australia and Canada, take an example that change to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the question of partnerships Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online.
