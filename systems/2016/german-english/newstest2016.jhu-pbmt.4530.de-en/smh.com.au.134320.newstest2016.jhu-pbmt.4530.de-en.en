Man after police chase wasn't persuaded, from the Canning River to come
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth, the police depend, has failed to return when he was in the shallow and marshy water, just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to persuade him gently, to the shore. "
The police from Canning Vale was on Tuesday at a break incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of the Canning River.
But he was not too far.
"He was in the water and said 'I don't come out, come and get me, Senior Sergeant Shan dell Castle Dine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too thrilled to make his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated."
"Sometimes people do funny things in order to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castle Dine.
Championship football player Ben cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, cousins drove his car into the ditch in order to avoid an alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben cousin-biathlon.
