Stevan Hogg used phone for girls to attract paedophiles to send pictures
A PÃ¤dophiler used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl when it slept, loggte in an online messaging service, of which he is a series of dishonest images of children that he had been sent by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
You saw it, was the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took it and saw the five images, then analysed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches, the terms of the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he had done it because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and then "pretending to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor of the Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he is addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was the trembling and weeping.
They also saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the defendants.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendants used computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty on indictment to have included indecent images of children on 14 June last year on the 25th of January this year, against the rules, and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg did not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no significant sexual element" in his offence was found.
Sheriff Alistair conservative postponed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept for hearings on other outstanding cases in custody.
He was taken before the date of the judgment in the list of sexual offenders.
