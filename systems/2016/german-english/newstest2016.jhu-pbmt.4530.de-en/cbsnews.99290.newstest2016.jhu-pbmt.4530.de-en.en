Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in a national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent, while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent.
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, the support of 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates say they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have narrowed.
Her support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a large lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of the Democratic voters in the primaries across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support them, because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly excited by it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters who say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say that about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want it to be the candidate, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility will also be cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.
If the primaries democratic voters are asked who would be the party for their second choice, Biden is at the top.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases, by 20 points, with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden, a second is by far in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.
Nevertheless, the question of what is more important for a candidate to call Democratic voters questions about the eligibility.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates for their party's primaries provide good results in a number of important characteristics of voters.
Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, Clinton's strength is in the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, more than twice as many say that Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primaries, Clinton, Sanders and Biden are generally ideologically in line with their views.
In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters had no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, continue to be made, most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this issue was in March, shortly after the problem came to light, divided.
Most Americans said that the email controversy has no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them, as a whole, among registered voters: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less than 15 points since May.
62 percent of voters do not think it is an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationally to see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, get good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush are doing best in honesty.
A majority believes Sanders more than honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
