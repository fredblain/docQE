Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it is not so much Christmas-season team will adjust as we did last year, but the Spielzeug- and baby products retailer says that he's currently working on his employees and seasonal workers will be an opportunity to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, even at Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers have been hired.
Most of the jobs will be part time jobs.
The company said that it will begin this month with job interviews and the number of employees rose from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
