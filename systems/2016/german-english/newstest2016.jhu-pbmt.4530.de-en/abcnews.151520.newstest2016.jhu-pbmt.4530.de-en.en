Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royalty, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it is gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind that I am a simuliertes yawn and a poor length from the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Robert Zemecki's director and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "no doubt the biggest journey film, which was shot ever."
"Back in Time" is on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
