"American Ninja Warrior" crowns first champion
Professional sport climbers and help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete of the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and won the Grand Prize of $1 million home.
The competition show, which has just completed its seventh season, had never seen a contest participants, all stages of his obstacle-course could finish.
During the final season, there were two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, down to the finals.
The last task was the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the job within the time, and he was the first athlete, who completed the arduous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero ended this challenge a full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News $after the hard-won victory, still in shock over the profits of the Grand Prix of 1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I have never earned more than $10,000, or" alive, Isaac told E! A bunch of money.
So all of a sudden.. like me, I could not even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent weed, sat down with The Hollywood reporters to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he finished the first of all the course, not just any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist gets it," the one with the fastest time to weed.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changed, he receives the great Gratifikation.
I do not think he has any resentment about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He is a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I were to be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it's Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
