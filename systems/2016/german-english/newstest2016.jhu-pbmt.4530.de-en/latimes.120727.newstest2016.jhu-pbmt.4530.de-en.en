At its most anticipated meeting in Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot-Honduras mahogany table, to decide whether it is time for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate.
Loom above them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues, the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And the third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict them, it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 to be weaned.
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets, the already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rates on federal bonds to increase - and it is only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they" observe, Lindsey M. Piegza, Chef√∂konomin at the brokerage firm, said Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty to wait around the global market enough justification to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what confuses itself in the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg, have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets are expecting the Fed wait, with a key indicator that shows only a 30% chance of an increase.
This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises rates, unless the strategists would soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far removed.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates would be at this stage, "he said.
If it does, "they would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had in the spring and early summer, said that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required to expect an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation persistently below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary effect of sharply lower oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
But the financial markets around the world zuckten at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its record high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, while the Dow is now down by almost 10% below the high in May.
Representatives for the Fed's influence the market turbulence, the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so technically it should not be involved in their decision making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere mention of the former leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could narrow their monetary expansion, "" triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, from the Fed's representatives can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks and expert advice to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy, said of the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that the Fed "a history of overreaction on financial market movements that do not seem to with the economic fundamentals are linked."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings, "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should only be aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis, such as the market collapse of 2008 first, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee, said the interest rate set by the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"They will certainly not get into the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are" understandably upset, Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not think that they should jump ahead of time.
