Manege invites to dream
With the new staging of "passion" of the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus arts.
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dress and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the brick Â­ Wasen dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I cannot imagine to live without my circus family," Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior leader says.
"Passion" - under this motto, the current Manegeninszenierung.
For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift is to inspire the family is in the blood.
"It is important to us, the people from their daily routine wegzuholen and for two hours in a completely different world to take," says the 27-year old junior leader.
"Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair," says director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour this flair can now experience.

"The animals are part of our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes the view: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any pranks canvas.
"The four legged artists," as they are affectionately called, can be read as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal is not feeling well, it is not in the manege.
Therefore, the top priority: Good care for the animals.
Specifically on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a pen and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our small Jumbo, was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for it, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So something for every visitor should be there.
"One thing is for sure," Stephanie Probst says: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best and do it with all my heart."
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20 September at 5 and 8 p.m. every day to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program will begin at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday's family, for the presentation at 5 p.m., prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
