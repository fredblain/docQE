Certainly, David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing to learn about all parents: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
As a provider of childcare systems was asked, his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. /.
It is a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super Camps, and continues: "It was funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, but a summary of the film version of 2012 reflects the new characters and details added to the relatively short text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one, a love interest was Dr. /, whose real name was Theodor / hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron sometimes reads like the summary of the Lorax film on the Internet Movie Database website will be presented and thus begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams of winning."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little known, hears a unbenannter boy, as the local environment through the avaricious, trees cases, knitting Thneed Once-ler, despite the protests of the named Lorax, Hock, schnurrb√§rtigen, "which speaks on behalf of the trees," will be devastated.
Most likely, it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, The Lorax 20 times in a row is not a child read.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text of Cameron's constituency office is likely to come.
Super Camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but had no further immediate comment.
