Croatia: "We are the refugees."
"Now the controls are also on our southern border, high risks," said Home Secretary Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The checks at the Hungarian border, remain at the same time.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to make an application for asylum, this could also, of course, "".
The care and safety of the people stand in the foreground.
But it is also clear that "we need clear signals," said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not on the Austro-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia is considering "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wants to allow refugees to travel on to Austria and Germany, and may also create corridors for the refugees.
Just saw this interior minister, Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana.
The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable," Slovenia will actually intensify the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary.
The border with Croatia is an external border of the Schengen area, by contrast, already heavily controlled.
As the minister stressed that Slovenia is to seal its borders to refugees.
"Every EU member has to fill out its obligations, otherwise the system may not work," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced that the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday to enter in the Ostkroatien Tovarnik / Sid over to evade the registration.
The Croatian police failed to take them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik since then.
It is mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Also, emergency services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country with around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko project said.
There are buses from Presevo, on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which has been brought to the Hungarian border, migrants were diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that she had the Anweise people to follow certain routes: "Neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.
According to media reports, however, is the first bus arrived in the morning with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, more buses were expected.
On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants were all night, around 500 kilometres away from the Macedonian border with Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police told us that we are supposed to go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
Thus, it might actually have already predicted by observers to postpone the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary at a nearby stretch a little further west.
Croatia: "Comprehensive opportunities for border control."
Croatia's Interior Minister project had previously stressed that his country had prepared in the event of a large influx of refugees corresponding plans for possible emergency situations.
He gave no details, but he pointed out that Croatia as a non-Schengen member "comprehensive opportunities for border control.
We carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership of the Schengen area.
Slovenia is part of that, since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since a testimonial to what the standard of border controls.
On the Serb side, about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg continue to remain completely blocked.
Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local eye in Horgos: He thought the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, is premature.
Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.
It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Migrant workers - dangerous - alternative routes rates
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to the refugees maps showing alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless, however: In parts of the border area, there are also 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia is still not cleared minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern was sent to the border region.
