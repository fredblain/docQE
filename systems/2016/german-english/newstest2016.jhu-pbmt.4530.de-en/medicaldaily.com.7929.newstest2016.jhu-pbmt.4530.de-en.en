Brazil's Rio Grande p√§diatrische society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tried, in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, it does so with the presentation of images of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements will be pregnant women and young mothers, their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that should make mothers.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protecting them against the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
