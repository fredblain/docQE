Google launches Verdoppelungs fundraising campaign, about $11 million for refugees to gather
Google Inc (Googl; O) announced a Verdoppelungs-fundraising campaign that $11 million for humanitarian organisations have to help the thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, from war torn and impoverished countries are fleeing.
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donations and call on his blog.
Instead of a manager to make the announcement, wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul, when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"Our trip included too many dark rail and bus routes, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I had luck.
But since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family, desperate for help.
The donations will go to four charities, aid to refugees and migrants to: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million to google.com / Refugee Relief doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four years of civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many people are fleeing from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
