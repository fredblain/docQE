"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe could not accommodate all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compas Ion in Oxford, which is devoted to the study of ethics.
He demanded that the interests of humanity should be put under the circumstances before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised in Germany and Austria's efforts to tackle the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Managing several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and George Bush's actions commented after the terrorist attack on September 11, and it became clear that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in nonviolence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
