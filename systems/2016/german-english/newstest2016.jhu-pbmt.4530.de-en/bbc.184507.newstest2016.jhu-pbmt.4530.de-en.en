The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers" could mean.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost of the expansion plans could hit by JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer new jobs.
