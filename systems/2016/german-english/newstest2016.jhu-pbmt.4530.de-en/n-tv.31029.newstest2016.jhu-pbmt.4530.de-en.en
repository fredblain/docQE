Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
Also, more and more refugees are looking for an affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
The social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution battles on the German housing market have started a long time ago.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many cities.
They compete with low-income citizens the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would need to be built every year by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the Alliance "social housing associations comes."
By comparison, this year 260,000 units will be finished in Germany.
With 140,000 homes are missing.
Refugees are required for the first three months of their stay, no longer to live as asylum seekers in a reception.
Many come to the housing market and a fall in the long queues in front of the apartments.
According to the German Federal Statistical Office states, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year, however, for rent.
The negative development of the housing market, however, is not only in the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of the last few years.
Germany play a housing deficit, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, around 770.000 units were missing in the urban areas, Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study laments.
For this reason, many professionals lived in large cities are forced to WG-rooms.
Young adults were due to the slowdown in the housing market involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama."
In the cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined in recent years, for the first time.
To solve the problem, the alliance "social housing" proposes a fresh start.
However, new incentives to boost social housing.
It could be dispensed with the estate tax and property taxes for subsidised housing will be temporarily suspended.
In addition, an attractive tax relief are necessary, according to the alliance.
The funding programme for refugee housing, the state bank KfW is already in towns and cities.
A week after the launch, more than half of the available around 300 million euros was on Monday evening, with 184 million euros has already been retrieved.
Now, the project could be increased.
