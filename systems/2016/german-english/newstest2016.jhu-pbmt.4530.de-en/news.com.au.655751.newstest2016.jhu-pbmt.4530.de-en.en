Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine to accept the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has produced no major shifts in the opinions of Today.
The breakfast show from Nine was broadcast from the federal capital, when Malcolm Turn Bull created the overthrow of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Army days, was in London as part of a week's series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The disadvantage of the distance for Australian TV viewers seemed to play no role, since Sunrise average 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, by comparison, Today 339.000.
Today reported a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317.000) and Tuesday (283,000), but his numbers remained behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today, the gap has closed in recent months at sunrise.
In August, Today 318.000, on average, compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise stands at an average of 314.000 349.000 viewers on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change are these people more than the House tomorrow.
Karl and Lisa are alright, thank you for the review.

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with former series of packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million viewers.

The X Factor of Seven remained strong, with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results on day two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe showed on average 446.000 spectators.
The second half hour (17: 30 to 18: 00) jumped to 623.000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat Mode (613.000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520.000 viewers and in the second half hour whopping 720.
Hot-seat 620.000 on average.
The decline in the rate of the second evening of The Chase Australia is a confidence vote that hot seat at 17: 30.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for Million Dollar Minute who failed to surpass the McGuires show.
