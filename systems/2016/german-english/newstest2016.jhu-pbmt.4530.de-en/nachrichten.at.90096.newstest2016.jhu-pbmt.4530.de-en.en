The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends many thousands more to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government into the orbit of Nazism.
Victim of this policy, not only those Austrians who are now faced with a chaotic situation in the border areas.
The disciplined will have to say that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing influx of refugees and the onset of winter, with decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
