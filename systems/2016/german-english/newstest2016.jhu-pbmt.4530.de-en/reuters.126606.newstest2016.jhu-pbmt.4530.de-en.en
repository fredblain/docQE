NHC says 60% chance of cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands ahead
The US National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60% chance over the next 48 hours to develop into a tropical cyclone.
Another clearly defined low pressure system about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles has a 60% potential in the next two days to form a tropical cyclone, the weather experts stationed in Miami.
