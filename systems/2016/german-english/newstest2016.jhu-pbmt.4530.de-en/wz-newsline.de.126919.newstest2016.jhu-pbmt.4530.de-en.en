Jewellery instead of curtain - Plauener tip as a fashion niche
Before it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace in a large amount of customers who, for example, they processed to blankets and curtains.
That no longer works alone, Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of fashion tip Plauen explains.
Instead, the fashion is important.
In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives some examples: Top in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and regional costumes.
Indeed, says the vintage fashion, which in past eras, a growing business potential.
Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche, is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen, along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery.
Only they can wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales are tonight.
Private shops and wholesale, there are almost no more.
Our products reach the customers in this way.
Today, the commodity will be manufactured in Asia, much cheaper and sold almost exclusively on chains.
In addition, the export schwächle, currently to Russia and the United States.
So, enough reason for new routes.
The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg Branch of the West Saxon Hochschule Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and businesses who need to think, especially economically, "Schmidt says.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revitalized the historic snowball head.
However, the machine uses small beads in some places.
The Plauener Goldsmith champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became: "Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing."
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewellery.
In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region to identify with the topic of Plauener tip - young and old," says Reuter.
It also returns to the US, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area, and who want a piece of memory.
