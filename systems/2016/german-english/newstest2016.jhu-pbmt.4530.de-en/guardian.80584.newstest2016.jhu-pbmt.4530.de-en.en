Experts criticise report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a publicly funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined Lancet, by the Public Health England (PHE) in her report on e-cigarettes used evidence.
PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have called into question the reliability of the data, and highlighted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE its main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "on stone or sand build."
Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" on a detailed review of the evidence and the modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to a model of a multiple criteria and decision analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to develop their opinions about the damage caused by various nicotine-containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research report.
McKee and Cape, said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, the managing director of British American Tobacco to previously means (BAT) to obtain an independent study.
He also signed the references of BAT to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that funds from an e-cigarette-maker, but not the funding, according to reports by the tobacco company Philip Morris International is said to have received, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but there are several popular e-cigarette champions, some of which is also an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, also took the tobacco by PHE.
The research group "significantly," admits that there is a lack of hard evidence, the damage of most products on most criteria, "said McKee and Cape.
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report.
McKee and Cape, said that the allegations of PHE that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes as a way to smoke for children or serve smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that it has responded to the allegations by BMJ earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still have to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows, and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from diseases related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion a year.
The clear submission of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage that will be caused by smoking, and we meet our national competence.
