Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year old into student housing, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smile of those who I have annoyed - and to the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student residences range from slightly fraught and absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to tell schwatzen: People where you come from and where you've taken sabbatical where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite "frankly neither hate nor because seriously guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha," I am in my room.
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Do questions and they show interest.
It draws the conversation and helps you to identify the people who you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers.
Let people.
The rooms of people turning into beverage receptions, movie night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people dress up and back into their underwear.

Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many students residences form a room-to-room-pedestrian culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be a hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I love you, and I want to continue our friendship, but you have to go away, so I get the energy that I have used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a Man is exhausted by sociability - and it will send an SMS knocking him.
Speaking of knock: You do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a number of things.
Close friendship with baking.
Since the university at the height of the Back-mania start is the knock on the doors of people with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I gave you a little baked, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Homemade to offer is a good way to close friendships.
Her housemates feel obliged to talk and will probably end up associating your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed up lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people are asleep when you knock.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course, the mouth of chicken is a theft, but it is the capture of a drop Milchs for your tea?
Check it with the dairy owners.
The chances are good that they say to themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your belongings, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident, who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise, which prevents people from sleeping or from work.
It is not just a question of being a decent man, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people who are sitting in a glass house.
A girl on my floor asked their neighbours to ask them whether it is something a little quieter drum & bass, because there are three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They have responded with even more loud music.
When she finally stopped at 5 p.m., they left their neighbours are grateful to sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring, completed her door and went to her three hours of testing.
Would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to occupy the same student housing?
On the other hand, it would not be abysmally embarrassing if you are a resident of your future Ehepartnerin, special to separate them, and then they have to look at every day and perhaps see how it moves across all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a resident is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin try, at least, persuade your abdomen a little common sense.
Leave in the exciting moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room not verschlossenem, the boundary between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments before he becomes a boomerang.
Submit by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about security - but you never to flood someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
They lock their doors, and they put their keys in a glass of water, then place in the freezer - but you are tackern their possessions on the ceiling, no more than twice.
