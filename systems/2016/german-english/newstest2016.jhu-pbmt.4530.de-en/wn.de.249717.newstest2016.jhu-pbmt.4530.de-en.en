Robot cars: Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the federal government to change the car technological pioneers.
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house by Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the fringes of the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries to discuss at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.
The strategy of the Transport Ministry, among other things, emphasises the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid Umstiegs on digital radio.
For the testing of new technology, a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently under construction.
Thus, any additional liability risks are saddled with the driver, "" the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."
So, for example, Germany wants to engage internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.
In addition, the federal government wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention, which stipulates only the people as a driver.
The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data within seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economics highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads "were not expected until well after 2020."
The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the cars can be safer and more efficient to run on the road," said the SPD transport politician SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of personal data, however, the driver needs to be clarified.
The German self driving cars, however, are sceptical - much more than the French or the Americans.
A Wednesday at the AA's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars in the next ten years will prevail, only 32 percent expect it in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect with autonomous driving cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self.
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control over the entire trip on all roads.
On the highway that could be present in the flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam.
Well, one in four would car control under any circumstances.
