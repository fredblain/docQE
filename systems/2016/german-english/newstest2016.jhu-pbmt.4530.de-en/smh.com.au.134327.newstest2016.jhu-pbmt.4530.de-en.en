Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately.
He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the race, and he himself had found under difficult conditions, when it comes to the positive cobalt swab test at Lidaris was that he could not explain.
He had 18 months because of the espionage accusations withheld and did not want it "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I was going to say nothing, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once, Moody said.
You know that it went.
Sometimes you respond, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high, and I want my owners think I try my best for them.
When they start to think that I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.
Then I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had the bomb in an interview with racing.com walk that the Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables," Moody said of Racing.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly look to their noses because they have failed in an attempt to keep it.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time, and it still is.
That should bring me to the view that it will be personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am.
Maybe they need to give me my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say, think about it.
But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I am going to put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustrations levels of the trainer, with the protracted cobalt on Lidari's investigation, and the late scratching meant that he said that he "his license could throw on the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation for the unbeaten Black Caviar Master, described the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied, which breached against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this, "he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
It would have been so last night.
It would have been all day yesterday, which was true.
But it also had it on race day.
Moody with a three month disqualification to be confronted with the treatment of the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here they have gone too far," said Moody.
