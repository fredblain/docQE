Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads disgrace Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International anti-arms fairs video.
Dreadful murderers-drones!
Ankle zerschmetternde leg shackles!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock sticks, causing agonising pain, but left no trace.
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's biggest arms fair is a combative parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the willingness of the British government in the spotlight to bring weapons to repressive regimes on the Defence and Security Equipment International: Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands to bestow gifts.

But a separate campaign also leads to a lot of posters at bus stops and metro-trains to see and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Go from 15 to 18 September, with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads the characters of London Underground and the hallmarks of DLR line, which converts the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will travel with the DLR... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Dismaland Banksys.
A group called Special Patrol Group helped the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 -Pack of Inbusschlüsseln, claiming that "access to around a third of bus stops and advertising space on the planet gain."
Transport for London is the Plaka animal "vandalism" not funny.
One of the parody ads, which was produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will be more critical and try to bring political work for the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists make themselves with activists in protest movements to work and say that they have to go out into the real world, so that their art has an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms-posters greets the commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, the nonprofit with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was surprised at the silence around the advertising of the arms fair - there was a lacuna in the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "We give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy firms advertising, but "by the einbläuen with bright colors and animation, it remains more liable."
"They have done a fantastic job in helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices to raise at the show," says Tom Davies, of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded on our doorstep is illegal.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair dates from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors fantastically euphemistische products bestow gifts.

This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead, the outstanding to reproduce effects inside the target returns."
Whatever that is, it will not be pleasant.
