For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study may take at least five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time for something to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss surgery, an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote.
Weight-loss operations or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient, but most of the studies were carried out by people who pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered as normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

For the new study, the researchers used from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007, they have gained in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who embarked on this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly the same at 29.
Among those who undergo surgery, at 36% of the diabetes-disease completely and partially at 28%.
In the medical treatment group was full of diabetes compared to only one percent and partly in only about two percent.
In addition, the results were in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8 percent.
But this "better" tooth control - as you are in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - do not reflect reduced mortality in five years, according to the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie Group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete removal of the diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
It was in the Swedish study of obese people who undergo a Adipositas operation, about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients showed, Blackstone said, it should be reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously, as soon as the patient lies with a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes, it is really difficult.
