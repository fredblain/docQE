The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The major overhaul of "new shipyard" in the Linz industry line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building is listed IT company S & T moved, the rest (2700 square meters) of young, innovative companies in the technology sector will be rented.
"In the IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we need to try and make it work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Lower Hauser.
He could imagine in startup companies to invest in the new shipyard and later to acquire them.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which Hauser down some promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S & T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the German (FFG (Fédération Française de).
The building is leased from the Linz AG for 60 years of S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of the 2,700 square metres of space in the building are already rented, for a further 40 percent, there are questions.
