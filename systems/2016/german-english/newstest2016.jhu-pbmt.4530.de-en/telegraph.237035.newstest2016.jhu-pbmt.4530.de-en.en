Friends: The comedy show that we are serious lessons about male friendship grants
The lack of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of challenging the culture in question, rivalling the men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood" had his chances of recovery are doubled.
For those who are not depressed, half a circle of mentally healthy friends, the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.

Our digital lives are lively, strong, and to be successful, doubled, even though, in reality, dominates the isolation.

And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money can buy happiness, not really.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and his frequent hugs, moments when football peering in comfortable armchairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to, in any case, even if they are often withhold to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide, has really made me see how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often do not feel able to talk with friends.
The old saying "I come in," has a huge impact on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly. "
Friends one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
So my objective outsider status on the phone to people in moments of despair may also help, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so when you visit this weekend with the Comedy Central) festival to celebrate the day, completely redesigned scenery, why don't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you sit in Starbucks to see someone alone, you give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
