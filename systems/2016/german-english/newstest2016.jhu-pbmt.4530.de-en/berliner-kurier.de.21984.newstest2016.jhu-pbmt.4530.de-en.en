Justin Bieber, megastar.
A mere 21 years old, a HÃ¤nfling with Upper Chi ring frise.
The guy with the platinum blond hair 100 million euros is difficult.
Even more.
Currently, Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation defeated by.

Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.

More than 100 million, he is alleged to have contributed.
Some say that the hype went too far.
Others point out that Bieber would mean, in the United States and Britain with his new single "What do you mean?" At No. 1.

At least he is doing so.
