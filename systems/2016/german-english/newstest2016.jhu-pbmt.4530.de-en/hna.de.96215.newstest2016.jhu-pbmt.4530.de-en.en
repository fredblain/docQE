Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and low earners."
"I show how you still can build cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will push for the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms have no sustainability.
Because the people are, to a large extent.
In light of the refugee flow, we also need enough housing over the next few decades.
A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs at least.
It facilitates the integration.
It is different when you are under the people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that were built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Took six months of construction.
That is appropriate.
The building regulations have complicated their plans?
Gildner: Building, I have learned through my project.
Particularly complicated, it is always the impending special sword of Damocles and pitch regulation.
Creepy. "
Still, it is assumed that anyone who creates a terraced house with three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities of the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the residents responded to their terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had over the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more.
My project is the message, the ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.
I'll show how you can still build cheap and good.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
