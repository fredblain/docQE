Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create it."
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior to Germany this year, according to the Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD, Germany is even able to include a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do it."
What is in store for Germany, gives the following overview.
According to various estimates are needed between 350000 (estimate by the German Federal Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) homes a year - and the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously (250000 homes will be built.
Dramatically, however, is the lack of housing, especially affordable rental properties: A year falling out 60,000 to 80000 social housing from the rental price fixing, and these attractive apartments will also apply for refugees.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double the funding, currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing would have to occur every year, and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists agree and federal construction minister is that it also needs to give more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of the workforce in the long term can be disciplined in Germany.
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, to help them start, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also the self esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany, there has been a political shift, according to Thränhardt: From the work ban for refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was a ban on asylum seekers in the past five years, it has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
The company has the vision - also because of the resources - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is a sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.
In addition, studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt according to the royal road to integration work.
The Berlin school administration found that only a few station parents give their children to the care centres, it is estimated that 10 to 15 percent, "for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.
However, in order to convince the family from the benefits of Kita, the administration hand slip distributed in different languages.
The need for educators were to rise due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.
In countries without the knowledge of German students in Welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.
But they are not always informed by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration says.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception in Berlin, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has been abandoned, but now his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university.
For refugees with a residence permits or tolerance do not receive benefits under the current law, asylum seekers more if they begin a study.
The latter are basically not Bafög because they do not fall into the circle of people entitled to BAföG.
So far Belgium refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be eligible Bafög-, from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.
But even this funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen crash, Berlin's state secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play an important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslim, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
Islam, the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religion ratio.
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who cares professionally for the new arrivals.
On the rights and obligations.
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas, and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "immediately to their right, here," in Germany, forfeited, he said in the Bavarian broadcasting.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more than it is now a topic of the whole society.
The majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pressing.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - less than a decade since an anti-discrimination and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the series showed the spirits of murder, the police and the authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrants organizations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and commit what international agreements, such as the anti-racism convention, Germany, has to be a reality in the next few years, if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany would be able to provide the expected refugees medically, doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.
"As far as a power and capacity, we create it," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, this extra money to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery wants to hand over all arrivals on the registration health cards.
Services could be charged later with the Länder.
And, in the long term, it is highly questionable to toss as many people with limited service catalog, which stipulated the current law on asylum seekers.
Otherwise, the doctors are especially the language barriers.
In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, including medical practices would have to be taken on interpreting costs, she says.
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are far more unprocessed disability, and young people go to HIV education.
With some of the other diseases, German doctors would come from their education, but clearly, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as far as the shortage of doctors, even relief may be in sight for the refugees.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapy (BPtK) mentally ill: Most suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, says Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study by the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from "flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, palpitation and Todesängsten.
Other symptoms of sleep and concentration disorders, strong shock and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent the chronic symptoms would be an early treatment, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services can make a request for a psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.
In addition, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses were mostly in the social services, to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
