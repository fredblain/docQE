Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
You are not supposed to anr√ºhren legends, but Disney still dares to a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
This is according to "Entertainment Weekly" but not a spoofs, but a kind of sequel, 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experiences of the Nanny Banks with the family during the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, is still unclear.
But the director is clear: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" at the cinema.
