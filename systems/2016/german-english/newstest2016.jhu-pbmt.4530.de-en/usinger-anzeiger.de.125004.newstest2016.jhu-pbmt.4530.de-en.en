"Cassini space probe," Ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
The filming or photographing of the Saturnmonds Enceladus is a global ocean spills.
These include researchers from observations made by the Cassini space probe "."
Thus, the moon is teetering slightly on its orbit around the planet.
This tumbler movement is only small, but still too big for a consistently solid celestial bodies, says in a statement by the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (Tuesday).
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus."
It was known for some time that there must be under the ice of Enceladus liquid water.
It had already "Cassini" 2006 Eisvulkane covering the Saturnmonds discovered that water vapour and Eispartikel spew out and thus the E ring of Saturn feed.
At least at the South Pole, there needs to be an underground sea, astronomers concluded at the time.
The extension of the hidden ocean, however, was not resolved.
