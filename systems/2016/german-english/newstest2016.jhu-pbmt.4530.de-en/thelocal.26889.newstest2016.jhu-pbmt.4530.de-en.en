Here is the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute, a Kopfballtor.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, because it is not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a great game by Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with whom he made his illustrious career began back in 1999, changed.
"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it's a good start to look back, 2: 0 to win, and to cause problems to our opponents, even if there are certain things that we still" in the course of the season to perfection, Blanc said.
"It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet made one or two more goals. "
Beckham, who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which at the weekend with a 2: 2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the league could hold, but he was in the fourth minute trumped by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man who PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month has been taken over by Manchester United, and he suggested that when he turned in Marco Erzähler pass behind the defence ran into Malmö University, before he passed to Johan Wiland nicely into the corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory that was disappointed.
Malmö, Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage, came to national Anpiff with nine players on the field and was with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield strung a serious opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away in Kevin Trapps post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves sometimes, with some false passports and poor qualifications, not least from Inter, who was went on no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game and it was a pass from Inter, Di Maria turned into a spin shot by Wiland in the 52nd minute was diverted past the post.
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Ibrahimovic a left flank of Maxwell had been exploited.
That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could be low, before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later announced that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
