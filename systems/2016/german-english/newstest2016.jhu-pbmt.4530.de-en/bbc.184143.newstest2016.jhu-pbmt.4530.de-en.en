Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with tension
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is to his debut in the Prime Minister's Question Time and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise up to the first of his six set points shortly after noon, with his performance probably by the media and the Labour MEPs from the subject.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he might skip a few sessions to leave to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet, and after his speech at the Tuc-annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence, criticism from a number of Tory most provoked and is at the heart of several front page stories in newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence," and he has acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had come to the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused, Mr Corbyns top team to serve, and they refer to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin 1988 says that political differences within Labour "stack" after Mr Corbyn's remarks on the position of the European Union, and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn said the Tuc conference that Labour amendments to present to the whole idea of a limit as a whole.
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that she only against the government's plans, the limit of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader, David Cameron, the Tory leader, since he is in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House, opposite.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says that he "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and he has more than 30,000 comments.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too konfrontativ, and that he is "both repartee and refrain from arguing with the barbs and instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will represent him, if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought to the idea that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he had referred to John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he is from the policy in the style of a "theatre" to remove polls, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as a key barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons, and his standing among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and in need of reform.
