Frankfurt: Small life assistance for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give you a warm welcome, countless volunteer helpers is not without the commitment.
In Frankfurt, there are a whole range of people who support altruistic asylum seekers in the city.
To them, Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with heart and soul.
Even with its 74 Lenzen she still teaches.
Every Thursday, they do it in the asylum seekers at the Dillinger street.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is a completely different class than in a real school.
