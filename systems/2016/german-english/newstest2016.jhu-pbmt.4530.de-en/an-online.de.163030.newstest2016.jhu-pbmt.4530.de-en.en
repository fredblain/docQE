Delicate folk from a sceptic in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (sits today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the timid acting folk singers the US state of Michigan has recorded with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost struck by Stevens speech.
He tells from different places, which he repeatedly einzeichnet on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
Where they are, and how it looks in his home country.
Since then, Stevens turns out to be a wonderful creative madman.
With the third album, released in 2003, and "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties snuggle, but always drifting into the great opulent seem wise.
There is a rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of an audacious series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But in 2004, and has already appeared in Rhine near "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens is here.
Live guitar and banjo with him.
A year later, the musician living in New York, back to the series.
With "Illinois" ("a sceptic Invites You To: Come on Feel the Illinoise") is a highly acclaimed masterpiece board in 2005.
Ãœberbordend of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album in the US Billboard charts and is lacking in any year best list of influential music media.
After a very productive experiments Stevens uses on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic fragments.
This sixth studio album is still widely orchestrated, but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and Hall.

Currently, a sceptic tours as part of a five-member band in Germany.
In the dark held Hamburg More!
He presents the theatre mainly available since March, "Carrie & Lowell."
Although nearly 2,000 guests sit here now glued to their chairs, the much more mature that Stevens returns to the intimacy and the folk.
To be without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians is enriched by the album.
We hear from the audience: The lecture was "abundant" and thus you can basically throw away the "plate."
Only a modest encore Stevens says, plays acoustically a few older songs and, finally, you would not want a barrage of applause.
