That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom is flagging, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know how long it takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the story offers little guidance for the economy in the end.
A recession came in just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial assets.
As a result, representatives of the US central bank so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when to start raising interest rates, but rather on the period that is needed for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could see that the whole excitement has been exaggerated, possibly due to a rise in interest rates.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," Julian Jessop, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at very low levels, to the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead.
That does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not as dramatic.
"There seems to be a trend that asset yields 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be strangled, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank's analysts in a recent study of what happens after the Fed's interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is usually in the past 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat over the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle, and thus increase the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote raising interest rates.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
It is very noteworthy that GDP is close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank's nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent, only a few that will last and are waiting for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Participants throughout the year to a rate hike by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that an increase in the FOMC could approve this session, the futures trading is only a probability of 25%.
"In our study have all increased cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows asked," according to the report.
In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are now 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, because the market is anticipating a rate hike, and similar to the pattern rather than on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks, if they change their strategic course.
With bond yields seem to change direction, as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
By Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, European fixed income at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already on the Fed's policy and expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed," she wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightens its strategy.
By and large companies that do most of their business in the US, will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, and the financing of its debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend, three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets for each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with low quality (by an average of 4 percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts are divided on how quickly it will take place.
