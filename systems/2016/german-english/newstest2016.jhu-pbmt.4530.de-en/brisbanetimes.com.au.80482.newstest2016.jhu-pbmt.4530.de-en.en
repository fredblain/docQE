Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, which is always referred to as "Special Ks," came the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had to Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee, where Harrison stated: "Beat Wawrinka had Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racquet, after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group foiled, Kokkinakis was steadfastly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard an artist's in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
"One thing that I really ereifere me is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was dragged into the dispute a little bit," Healy said.
He has broken a racket, because of a Krampfes lost in the US Open, but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he was in the U.S. Open extremely well, even among the somewhat provocative circumstances, with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I think he was a little too strict.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never been a problem with the other players, he will be respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good form, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios in the major preliminary decision, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra, as part of a long term return to the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not" to all the controversy around [Kyrgios], Healy said.
And I think Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, it is in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he deserves, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
