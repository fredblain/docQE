Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long term study of Potsdam.
The good news: The risk of abandonment is falling.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is apparent from the long term study of an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to nonsmokers, smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
Leading causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the meat, the DIfE stresses.
This saliva dries somewhat smoking is a risk factor, the authors point out.
The link between smoking and tooth loss, therefore, go back to frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoke also increased the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, "the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years before the threat sinke back to the level of nonsmokers, explained first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England.
We have to convince people to take up smoking, study director Heiner Boeing said the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life."
Not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and is good for our findings to a good dental health well into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by loss, the DIfE announced.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long term study, the findings untermauere.
