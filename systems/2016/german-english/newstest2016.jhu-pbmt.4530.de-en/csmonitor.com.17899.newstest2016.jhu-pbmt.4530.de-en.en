Five members of the Brotherhood, with the death of a Baruch College newcomer charged
Almost two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, brutal and delayed his journey to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand has been charged, and has been attacked repeatedly, while he tried to have a frozen field on an objective approach.
Finally, Mr. Deng complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to the police.
However, they had the time to switch Deng's clothes to Google his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and the welfare of the Brotherhood were basically over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970 in the harassment," said Douglas Fier, a lawyer who represents Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended a third degree charges of murder for the first five members.
Zweiunddrei√üig members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We want to make not only the people involved, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership of the local group.
