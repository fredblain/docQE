Why do I will be witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man will be put to death.
When it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State from 1929, when Richard Glossip will be executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was back in January for the first time about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and since there are often more applicants than places available, a macabre lottery will take place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected, who will observe it dispassionately.
I can do that.
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I am not a witness and a journalist, so it will not be possible for me, a notebook and a pen to take to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she had "put it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong to what I do.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses.
But he wants an international reporter is here to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement against the death penalty will help.
Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you should hear a series of podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back on all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the deed.
But I believe that there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can go for it.
What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
