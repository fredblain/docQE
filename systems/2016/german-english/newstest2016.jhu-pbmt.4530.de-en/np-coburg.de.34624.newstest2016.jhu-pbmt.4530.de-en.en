Actually quite different topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free voters meeting.
"The issue is, of course," the exam of asylum camps, Aiwanger said.

"So it is not on, we need to remember the causes," said the Free voter chief.
Want to deport rejected asylum seekers the Free voters as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.

"Bavaria deport, others."
"We need to be more capable of action."
But the land policy in Great Wall City should not be forgotten.
The years of evergreen remains on the agenda: The education policy.
