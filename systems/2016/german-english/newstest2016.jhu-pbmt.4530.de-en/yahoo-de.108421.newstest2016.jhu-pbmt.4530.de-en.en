EU wants to limit mercury in predators double
The European Commission wants to double the levels of mercury in large predators and consumers expect a much higher dose of nerve gifts.
The consumer organisation Food Watch, which is a working paper by the EU, sharply criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy with full force to pregnant women and infants passed," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch.
Wolf Schmidt says that the limits of the nerve poison should be raised for big fish at the end of the food chain, such as Hai- or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that around 50 percent of the catches are based on the current limits cannot be sold.
Then, after doubling the limit only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return, the EU wants to tighten for this easing, according to food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described it as "trick" because smaller Fried fish such as carp are usually burdened so low that they already comply with the planned levels.
The reduction in small fish is "a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy," said Wolf Schmidt.
Mercury for humans, a highly toxic heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain, especially in predators is strong.
Therefore, the federal government warns that "even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn."
The Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website regarding the current limits, however, that a "health risks to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury mainly by the coal combustion into the environment.
The German coal plants run according to a written report of the Federal Ministry for the Environment of the German Green MEP Anna Lena Baer Bock, more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanent and comprehensive" mirror "exceeded in March from the paper," quoted.
In the past year were European warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
