Seehofer: "Borders are not sealed off."
In a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) akkordiert on Monday further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off.
The journey of refugees in the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there is now doing precisely the appropriate controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being, there will be no more.
To be seeking protection, however, with regular trains to Germany.
The other EU member states Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria is introducing new controls on its borders, for Pühringer "is a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
