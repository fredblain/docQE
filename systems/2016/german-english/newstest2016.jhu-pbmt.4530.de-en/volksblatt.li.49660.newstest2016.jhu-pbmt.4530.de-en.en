Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation in Rome, there is now a place of Martin Luther.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday was a previously anonymous place in the park on the Oppio-hills in the name of the German reformer.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognised as a "German theologian of the Reformation."
The park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome, right next to the Coliseum.
The name had been requested by the Association of the Protestant churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Lutheran church hymns in Rome, recalled Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of popes for centuries as a minority, often only able to live their faith in secret.
The space will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome would be welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk at the New Year 1510 / 11 for a few months in Rome.
At the time, he felt the city as verkommenes sins Babel.
His negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him to think of historians in his subsequent fight against Rome.
Luther had begun with his theses against the selling of the division of the Western Church.
