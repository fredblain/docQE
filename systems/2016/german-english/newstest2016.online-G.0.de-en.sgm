<seg id="1">8 survey values, the show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried him as a Flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have him dismissed as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter how some Republicans are trying to pull the Donald Trump of the top ranks in the polls below, it has not worked (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls, Donald Trump showed double-digit lead, and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts emphasize that to be delivered this time, in 2011, Rick Perry's guide to the ascendant Herman Cain, none of whom won a state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a General election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative business group Club for Growth Trumps now see-through and start to make your dollars flow, to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some of the current survey are not values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is only a temporary Phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, showed a poll by the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul is positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Until the middle of July it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these Numbers hold in the early States.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of the GOP voters the GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "delighted" or "satisfied", if Trump would be nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "delighted" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they are "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush is the favorite of the Establishment, the candidate would be.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans Trumps Temperament does not see as a Problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements, believe 52 per cent of the to tend to the Republicans, the Irish voters that the real estate Mogul have the right Temperament for a President, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is in the first pre-election state of the Nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44 percent do not think that he had the personality to effectively be the office, and almost six out of 10 Independents say that his Temperament did not fit into the White house, so ABC/Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When you put your Gelehrtenhüte, to keep Republican voters Trump for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When you are asked who will win the most the GOP nomination, say according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week's four out of ten, that Trump was the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July your money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters the clearest crystal ball had not in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">To thinking at this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Romney, Mitt.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, a variety of GOP voters Trumps reputation campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to trump leadership, while the Anti-Trump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates, diffuse.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump the majority garners support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has Carly Fiorina a 13-point lead, ahead of Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker with 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie's 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A slight majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says that you have formed your opinion.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new survey from CBS/NYT on Tuesday, shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that you have awarded your votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really tell you to never change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Nevertheless, trump's strongest competition at the Moment, the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that you have formed your opinion, are twice as likely to be for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ever since Donald Trump said in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico, "rapist", was turning the immigration the focal point in the public discourse to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are worried that the bombastic manner of expression, Trump will hold a crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican party remote and the Neuorientierungs efforts will damage it.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in matters of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="55">Thus, as long as immigration stays in the spotlight, Donald Trump, apparently.</seg>
<seg id="56">The Frustration over the government's climb to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">On Donald Trump and Ben Carson about half of the support of Republican voters now account for, especially by their outsider Status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, you prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans than the Republicans are frustrated in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash launches ground-employment-campaign to combat Aldi - incidence</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores in front of an Aldi onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-employment-campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $ 700 million Aldi-Invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi is preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first of 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengths, Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand IGA by Mainstream Marketing and marketing through Social media, as well as through Events such as the Adelaide Show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers to jump on Board, with brands such as ice-cream Simmo from Dunsborough, which is to be distributed to IGA stores, samples, and shop owners, the reduced-price Tickets for the South Australian football League to a loyal customer sale.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash further Details of his defence strategy on the 29. Released September, when the leading wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment of its annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at the game, as South Australia and Western Australia, almost 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the Eastern States, generate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern States.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts believe, such as Morgan Stanley, Aldi will snatch twelve months after the opening of its first stores about five percent of the food market in these two States and all the existing stakeholders, but mainly independent retailers, sales will take off.</seg>
<seg id="10">In this week according to a report published by the Analyst Tom Kierath from Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers 360 $ million in revenues per year and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened in the next year, 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocery business and at the amounts on Metcashs high fixed cost base Metcash could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes, said Mr Kierath.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash loses market share in the Eastern States, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA-buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley takes on that Metcashs sales in food and grocery business will drop to 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and to 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020 will reduce.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely within a decade. Metcash disappear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash declined to respond publicly to the comments of Mr. Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a Board has included a member of the Metcash with Mr. Douglass, last week contact.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAs share of the market has fallen since 2010, from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen since 2012, a 43 percent reduction in the operational debt at the same time, pressure on sales and margins reflects.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wholesaler fights, however, and invested more than $ 150 million, in order to improve selling prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week to align and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to deliver a better selection of private Label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs chief Executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and Charge-restructuring programs will increase in vigor and hopes that the large-scale return to the dealer in the year 2017, for the first Time in four years, earnings growth.</seg>

<seg id="9">He has broken a racket as he lost due to a spasm in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet out of frustration with yourself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he behaved the same way in the US Open extremely well, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison, and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great Team around him, he has a great family around you, and I think he was treated a little too harsh.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very Mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the Team and so on, he has never had a Problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker area, he trains hard, he is in good Form, he is a very stable and Mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the all-important preliminary, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as a long-term integral part of the Team to return."</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we hope that the Team is completely focused on competition and not on all the Controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick has very quickly managed to the rise of what people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the Public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable. Some time outside of the spotlight, he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the Best thing for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders cut in half in a national survey</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of state Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primaries (58 per cent previously), while Sanders is in the second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, has not yet announced whether he's running for President, gets the support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, say the majority of democratic voters, that it is too early to say that, in your opinion, which candidate you support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are in your choice better than the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored a few wins.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead among women and Moderates, but these projections have been reduced.</seg>
<seg id="9">Your support for the men, has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among democratic voters under 50 years of age has vanished, and you and Sanders are now at the same height.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton has a big advantage among the older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the past month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a double-digit lead for the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the democratic voters in the primaries of the country say that they would support with enthusiasm Clinton, if she would be nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support it with some reservations and a further 15 per cent would support it only because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprising, that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed in the case of those who do not currently support Clinton, only about a quarter would you enthusiastically support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries to say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, say less Republican voters this on your top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question, why do you want that she is the candidate, is the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 per cent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the Job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Clinton's supporters, her connection with Bill Clinton (9%) is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Consent to dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the Vice President casts a potential run for President in the pan, you want to see 57 percent of the democratic voters in the primaries him in the race, though a third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If democratic voters in the primaries will be asked, who would be for the party their second choice, Biden is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice, far ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Not Biden, to run for the democratic nomination, will increase Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances to win the election; however, this figure of 78 per cent has fallen in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that views him as the "selectable", is increased.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, the question of what is a candidate key, call democratic voters questions about eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters in the primaries stands out as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates to provide good results in some of the most important characteristics in voters in the primaries of their party.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden, as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden cuts off at the three candidates is best at honesty, while Clinton's leadership.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of democratic voters believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters in the primaries, see generally Clinton, Sanders, and Biden is ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all of these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal E-Mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign Minister, are the most Democratic voters in the primaries satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is a different story to the American Public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans is now with your explanation dissatisfied, while only about one-third is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public opinion was in March, shortly after the Problem came to light, are cleaved.</seg>
<seg id="40">The majority of Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their General opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that it had worsened their opinion of her yet.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is considered by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a Problem for you, registered voters, total: Only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points since may.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of eligible voters do not hold for a honest and trustworthy Person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of the eligible voters of the country to see, far Trump as not honest and not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades in leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six tested candidates, Carson, and Bush cut Biden, and the best at honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority of Sanders sees more than honest, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">That will happen when the Fed increases interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is, how long will it take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the story provides for economic low the instructions to the end.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in Raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial systems to respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, representatives of the US have stressed the Central Bank so violently that investors should focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period of time that is needed for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, market participants may find, however, that all the excitement was exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates may.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be used by some as a Signal for the end of the Era of "cheap money" interpreted," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still on a low level, in order to lead to the seismic shock, the fear many seem to.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here's a historical trend-based view of it is likely to react to, as some sectors of the economy:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has in the last month seen, can make the anticipation of interest rate increases in things for a while volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There seems to be a tendency that income on the assets 12 to 24 months will be stalled after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts happened in a recent study, which increases to interest rates by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is in the last 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 per cent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's published.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the share tends to occur later in the hike cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in interest rates, they often promote.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is faced with some of the conditions that existed before and which could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Extremely noteworthy is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point in the case of an interest-rate increase by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank was one of the 118 interest rate, the nominal GDP increases since 1950, only twice under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, expect only a few that this will continue and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this Time," said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have made throughout the year on an interest-rate increase by the Fed in focus, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and Economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session, the Futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all of the increase in cycles from 1950 to today, in a Super-cycle took place with increasing momentum in GDP and in Front of-recession highs very soon after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow," the report said.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is a unequivocally slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed Phase.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, the the Fed since the end of the last recession has been waiting for; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income is also volatile, as the market takes an increase in interest rates is anticipated, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect for bonds is faster than in the case of shares, if the change their strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease is done in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the increase cycle, the bond fall yields immediately, said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">The strategist of Charles Schwab, believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds often bring in such a climate, better yields, although "we are still careful not to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is interesting to note, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to the Fed-strategy-expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, Credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened their strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">All in all, companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise, local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multi-national companies with high debt are worse off, because a rising Dollar makes their products in the global market, more expensive, and as well the financing of their debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that "quality" tend to share, three months after an initial rate increase to respond very positively to," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customer.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in its shares also outperformed their counterparts with lower quality on average in each of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debts become a big Problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most, said Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure share a consumer will benefit games also due to the rising Dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if the experts are of different opinion, how quickly will this take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">Certainly David Cameron, The Lorax knows better?</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child is a book of loves, it will not take long until you know it almost by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless you are, perhaps, David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, his favorite-to name a children's book, decided to the Prime Minister for The Lorax, in 1971, published in environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Website of the company super camps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."</seg>
<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph, Cameron describes how, allegedly, the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the Film Version of 2012, the new characters and Details added, to extend the rather short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest of Dr. Seuss, whose real Name is Theodor Seuss Geisel was and died in 1991, however, completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that wasn't suspicious enough of Cameron's Text reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the Website of the Internet Movie Database and so it begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits Yes, to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little acquainted. Here is an unnamed Boy, how the local environment greedy by the money stops, trees cases, the Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the Lorax, a squat, moustached beings, "speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR has a delegated task to a helper that The Lorax didn't read 20 Times in a row to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the Text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Super camps confirmed that the Text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but gave no other immediate comments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still hard</seg>
<seg id="2">To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when selecting the squad, the England for the Tour, see, this is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out an away win.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, a youthful, positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the Ball, Moeen Ali developed as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an Option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">This related message: Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision of Adam Lyth to leave out, of course, is for me as a head coach in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyze.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven Tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since, as I have said before - players are their own best selector.</seg>
<seg id="10">A long time ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he fails, hopefully, more runs for Yorkshire, comes one more Chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss is not praised his attitude, even if he rendered such good services, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a Team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a Test batsman to put his characters is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - such as Sam Robson in front of him, while Nick Compton nine got.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got a Chance to home and away games.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only criticism one can raise, was that England Trott first began Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman that I would estimate to be high.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X-factor-cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, what struck us very much.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea to let Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and four Quicks get, showed up, and I don't mind.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a hit man can't hit, and this left-hander has already shown that he is one heck of a Cricket player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen may not have done his Job for his County, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for you, and since there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first Drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an Opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has made three hundred Runs immediately and not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes in the squad as Back-up Spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me as a young man, very.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may have their stats - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the Ball - and think it is a Punt, but there is no large number of Backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn on this Tour a lot.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team of England has made a couple of clever additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahlah Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a Meistercoup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys of the game, will bring a Wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes on for the white ball Phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he is created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a Coach, and how Mahlah, he has insights from which we benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room fresh Wind, even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no Problem with it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some of you may not agree, but Coaches and team on the plates do not determine the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember that, as for the players, their Jobs, the results depend on.</seg>

<seg id="10">Germany's careful prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's since 10 years in Power, and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for you, as it is done in the excessively long, Held-out, such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and cabbage (16).</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize report from Public Health England about E-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegations of a government-funded Agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than Smoking arose from a Meeting of 12 people, some with Connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), were joined by the Lancet, by criticizing the Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes used in evidence.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE has published the "basic report" in the last month, and describes him as a "comprehensive Review of the evidence".</seg>
<seg id="5">However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data in question and highlighted the Connections between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet last month to handle the "extremely windy" basis, the PHE his main conclusion is justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two researchers writing in the BMJ, and asked whether the statements "build on rock or Sand".</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape corrugated, Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health strategies on the demonstration of efficacy should be based."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the Public expects, that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than Smoking," based on a detailed Review of evidence and modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people, were convened in order to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-MCDA) to guide their opinions about the harms of nicotine-containing products of a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Cape well said, that is a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose managing Director is previously from British American Tobacco middle (BAT) for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also references of BAT wrote to the Public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the Meetings said, to receive funds from an E-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing, he will have to Report in advance from the tobacco company Philip Morris International will receive, they added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied, but several well-known E-cigarette Champions, some of which also specify a industries-Finance in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting, the tobacco-pipe of PHE took part.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research work of the group, "admits, tellingly," that there is a lack of "hard Evidence of the damage of most of the products in most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Cape as well.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these Compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Cape well said that the claims of PHE, that "there is no evidence that E-cigarettes as a way to Smoking for children or non-Smoking" were premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, Director for health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously was not responding.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than Smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second of life long smokers dying of his Addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison to low, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear obligation to provide Information to the Public about what the evidence proves and what it is not, especially when so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to Smoking, and Smoking, the National health system costs two billion pounds per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">Through the clear is not Present the current Evidence that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by Smoking, are present, we fulfill our national responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop to send programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right Arm" for Hit Shows such as the Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for you to place public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial window of time against the most popular Shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come up with the BBC in contact.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that the BBC are programs in order, or sends, which would also clearly shown of non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson in the house of lords communications Committee's inquiry on the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you don't want to keep the licence fee, which I think is in the medium or long term is a good idea, you should.its production, at least on programs that do not make others, or in order to give</seg>
<seg id="8">Send The Voice in a first-class window of time, because you want to reach the widest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would, this show is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is nonsense, of course.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I can see why a regressive tax funded programs, which could also be without the subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, admittedly, both productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honestly, other channels would give their right Arm for.</seg>
<seg id="13">I'm trying to see how this is to be public-broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a contractor for the series, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 was head, said that the BBC is to blame for the hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments to the most popular broadcasts of the BBC's what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, who in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell Shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the more public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and you can argue, if you go to your hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of licence fee, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."</seg>
<seg id="18">Put it in a window of time in which nobody wanted to see ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">The licence fee Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive System, in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course you all think, we all think that you can get for £ 150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who is for the 150 £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5 boss, David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian Mission "to inform, to educate and to entertain".</seg>
<seg id="22">He said, only a little of the BBC production would now be classified officially as an education - he said that it had 1% of their TV-production and 0.1% in the Radio and you should take to the public television stations in Australia and Canada is an example of this change in "inform, educate and entertain".</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of shown on television and with the commercial broadcasters form alliances, to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics can tax the brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The Video shows how the nematodes change direction in the Moment, in the sound pulses are irradiated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have worms with genetically modified nervous systems bred, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment that you are with the sound impulses, which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard, to be irradiated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impetus to work through the Switching on of the motor neuron cells that have been genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">To read further on this topic: researchers and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said the worms showed the Power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, the ultrasound can be used to solve a series of brain-, heart -, and muscle-activating cells outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure might one day replace Deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Roundworms do not typically respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles of air.</seg>
<seg id="10">The blow, he found out, amplifying the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels and in the membranes of some of the worms cells are found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the Opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create ultrasound-guided cyst nematodes, changed Chalasani genetically the worms so that some of your motoneurons TRP-4-carrying ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">When applying ultrasound to the changed creatures, bubbles in the sound waves by the micro-reinforced and in the worms, where you turn on to invoke the motoneurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The method has some Similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking Tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light, which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain down, can pass through low frequency ultrasound waves the tissue without hindrance, and can be in the brain from the top to the skull sent.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic Virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound Signal in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments," said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and Insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="6">Cluster bombs!</seg>
<seg id="7">And electric shock rods, the agonizing cause pain, but leave no trace!</seg>
<seg id="8">The cheerful voice and the Cartoon-pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair, is a militant parody, which was produced by Amnesty International, the willingness of the British government to bring this issue into the spotlight, to sell weapons to repressive regimes across the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.</seg>
<seg id="9">Related: DSEI arms fair: Authoritarian regimes flock to London</seg>
<seg id="10">But a separate campaign, also leads to many of the posters that you see at bus stops and in the subway trains and require a second look.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Important announcement: from 15. to 18. September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) to read in the font of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, is transformed to the image of a tank.</seg>

<seg id="13">The 300 posters by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum for the cruel themes in Banksys Dismaland.</seg>
<seg id="14">A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London, and used "Ad Space Hack pack", a 6 lb-Pack of Allen keys, one of which, it is claimed that "access to around a third of bus stops advertising space on the planet to attain."</seg>
<seg id="15">Transport for London finds that Advertising-"vandalism" is not funny.</seg>
<seg id="16">One of the parody Ad, which was produced by the Special Patrol Group.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol design and a lecturer at the University of Essex, the artist will be critical and try to bring political Work to the audience outside of galleries.</seg>
<seg id="18">A lot of artists with activists within protest movements to work and notice that you have to go out in the real world, so that your art has an influence on the society.</seg>

<seg id="20">The Amnesty Video has been viewed more than 100,000 Times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by advertising Agency VCCP, which operates a non-profit with the graphic designer and Voiceover artist, who also works for free.</seg>
<seg id="21">VCCP creative Director Matt Lever was astonished at the silence which reigned around, the advertising for the gun show - by-ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "we Give you the campaign, which is trying to avoid you."</seg>
<seg id="22">They played with the invention of a new, more realistic, dodgy advertising, but "the Asking with bright colors and Animation, it is still stronger."</seg>
<seg id="23">"You have done a fantastic Job by helping us to raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty.</seg>
<seg id="24">What we need now is the Intervention of the British government, and the guarantee that torture devices are not traded in front of our door illegally.</seg>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from the area inside of ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight Golden rules for living in halls of residence</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, I as a self-forgotten 19-Year old in a Dorm, still in the Faith of Berets and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember the strained Smiles of those who I have annoyed and to the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The catchment in the student residences ranges from the slightly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is tempting to talk to: people tell where you come from, whether and where you the Sabbath, have taken, where they stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly Marmite neither love nor hate, because Seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take a deep breath.</seg>
<seg id="7">And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It directs the conversation and helps you people find out that you like, in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and this fire extinguisher would be.</seg>
<seg id="9">You Can People.</seg>
<seg id="10">The room of people transform often, drinks receptions, Film-night venues and local hangouts, but they are also the Places where people wear their underwear right now.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related to: not remember, at University, with a relationship to start</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts get a rough treatment at the University.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many of the student residences to form a room-to-room-shopping-culture that is friendly and social, and to lead life-long friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">This can be hell for someone trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away, so I get the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">You try to feel, when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted and you send him a text instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of waiting: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy in my student halls of residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Friends by baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you start University at the height of the Baking-mania, is the Knock on the doors of people to come up with a plate full of Brownies to present less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Homemade Treats are a good way to make friends is to offer.</seg>
<seg id="23">Your roommate feel obligated to entertain, and will associate at the end of maybe your face with a delicious Surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bad lumps from flour, sugar, and fat mixed cause people to be asleep when you knocked.</seg>
<seg id="26">To steal food, homes, a common crime in student housing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, the Mouth of chicken is a theft, but it is Taking a drop of Lactobacillus for your tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check with the dairy owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chances are good that you say to support yourself, even if you cook inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but they are trying to make a balanced deal as my roommate, the milk a detergent added, to punish thieves.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You should not make any noise, the people from sleep or work.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's not just about being a decent human being, but that they belong in the truest sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my floor asked your neighbors whether you'd mind, to Drum & Bass a bit quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and you had an exam Tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="35">They responded with even louder music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they stopped, finally, at 5 o'clock, let your neighbors in a friendly manner, sleep on it for two hours before they had their own music blaring, your door graduated and went of their three-hour examination.</seg>
<seg id="37">It would be romantic, if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same Dorm?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, it would not be profoundly embarrassed if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, you go for it, again disconnect and you will then have to see every day and maybe see how she pulls all the common friends to be over?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least, to your abdomen a bit of reason to convince.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exciting Moment in which you notice that someone let his keys in his locked room, is the border between a joke and bullying is fine, as it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good prank is funny, but it just eyes take glances, until he becomes a boomerang.</seg>
<seg id="42">You give by Hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but they mess it up never someone's room with toothpaste and Shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">You close your door and place your keys in a glass of water, which is then set in the freezer - but you staple your possessions to the ceiling is not more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, Single parents, low-income earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner building in the Franconian city of Eckental number of houses for people who don't have a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So for example, for refugees - but also as a Signal: "Not only refugees in need of Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and low income earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I will show how one can, even today, cheap and good build," says the 44-Year-old in the Interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: It builds in a project row houses for the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Gildner, many of the refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers, or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because the people remain to a large extent here.</seg>
<seg id="11">In view of the refugee flow, we also need in the next few decades, plenty of living space.</seg>
<seg id="12">A simple, three-storey row house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs the least amount of space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the Integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different when you bring people in residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that are currently built into the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many of the refugees are to say, it is peace again, I go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">How high are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro, without the land.</seg>
<seg id="22">The is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months of the construction lasted.</seg>
<seg id="24">The is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Complicated building codes, your plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: by law I have withdrawn my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Particularly complicated it's always, the looming sword of Damocles special construction and the Parking regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is always still, anyone who creates, in a row house of three apartments, one needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities of the place.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How was the reaction of the residents for your house project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There were those who accused me, to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What definitely is not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But they are not increasing the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: True is: We had in the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but luxury apartments that can barely afford a more were built.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, even the normal people are in need of housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or low-income earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how one can, even today, cheap and good build.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's about it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Croatia: "We have the refugees"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Now the border will be driven inspections at our southern border," said interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controls on the Hungarian border to remain in parallel to maintain.</seg>
<seg id="4">To be clear, that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also do this "of course".</seg>
<seg id="5">The care and safety of the people standing in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="6">Clearly, however, that "clear signals," said the Minister.</seg>
<seg id="7">People need to know that we accept limitless migration flows, not on the Austro-Slovenian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">It takes a controlled approach.</seg>
<seg id="9">Croatia is considering the "corridor" - Slovenia denied</seg>
<seg id="10">The Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia was willing to let refugees arriving in the direction of Austria and Germany travel and, under certain circumstances, also corridors for the refugees to build.</seg>
<seg id="11">So Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar saw this interior in Ljubljana.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of corridors was "absolutely unacceptable", Slovenia will rather intensify the Monitoring of the border, especially to Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="13">The border with Croatia was controlled as an external border of the Schengen area, however, is already strong.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the Minister stressed, does not want to Slovenian seal off its borders for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Each EU-member has to fill in his obligations, otherwise the System cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Croatian government has announced that it, too, had tried the first refugees already in the night hours of Tuesday, in Eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid over to enter to the registration to avoid.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Croatian police could pick up in the middle of corn fields.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees a meeting since then in Croatia, Tovarnik constantly.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was mostly Syrians and Afghans, many of them women and children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also rescue services and the Red cross were already in use.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the coming days, be country expect around 4,000 refugees, said Minister of the interior Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border would be redirected in the direction of Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade but denied she was there, the people instructing certain routes to pursue: "Neither can we, nor do we want to do this", it said.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the media for the first Bus with about 50 refugees had to report anyway, in the Morning in the Serbian border town of Sid arrived, in the course of the day, more buses would be expected.</seg>
<seg id="25">About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The occupants had been all night, from around 500 miles away Macedonian border with Serbia on the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so we were told by the police that we are here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">So it might come actually to the observers already predicted a shift of the previous Balkan Route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a slightly more westerly track.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Extensive opportunities for border control"</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong influx of refugees, plans for possible emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Details he mentioned, he pointed out, however, that Croatia, as a Non-Schengen-member "comprehensive border control".</seg>
<seg id="33">They perform strict checks in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia belongs to this, since 2007, the EU-partners from the country since then, consistently a good testimony to what concerns the Standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serbian side, approximately 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports, they had spent the previous night at the border crossing Horgos, leads to Röszke,.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Minister of interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried on Wednesday morning for a look at the place in Horgos to calm down: He'll keep the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed is premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would act not currently pay a very high Refugee.</seg>
<seg id="41">One could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Helper to rates of migrants - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started to distribute it to the refugees in the country cards on which alternative routes through Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not harmless: In Parts of the border area, there is also 20 years after the end of Croatia's war is still not cleared mine fields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a Team of bomb-disposal experts in the border region was sent.</seg>

<seg id="1">On their most anticipated meeting in years of the Federal Reserve to spend strategists for two days this week, around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the sitting position, in order to decide whether it is time, for the first Time in nearly a decade, raise the key interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming menacingly over them at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting hall, there is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The card is a reminder that the Fed should set Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the Nation before all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: maximize U.S. employment, and prices here are stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the great recession, the Fed's leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, to be of the unprecedented stimulus by the near Zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 weaned.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in the global financial markets, the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to add to this volatility by raising the interest rate for Federal loans - and it was also only a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and Inflation will be in the first line the most important thing you observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think, if you were not looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate, is the increased uncertainty around the global market, enough justification to continue to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what will the Fed do, what is insecure in themselves the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the Economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have said a rate increase this week before.</seg>
<seg id="12">The financial markets expect a Wait for the Fed, a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% Chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial jumped in average value to 228,89 points, or 1.4 %, to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy keeps the set in this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a Surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you do it, "she would have to go in your statement, very far, to calm the financial markets in order to panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets, because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">A month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said in the spring and early summer, that you expect this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required, an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, was the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level that the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of a recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although Inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, said the Fed representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower Oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world flashed at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in may by more than 16 % below its peak, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow the global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered a little this month, the Dow is now up almost 10% below the High in may.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed-representative of the market turbulence affecting the complex calculation, when should the interest rates increase.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not be about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks, you would attract in this session, take the reins," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that you will at least have to wait a month to get the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data, describing the developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, therefore, it should not be technically involved in their decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end, the Fed is a monetary authority in the world has become.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere note of the former head of Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013, that the Fed could its monetary Expansion "narrow", and caused confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can not be expected from the Fed representatives that you simply monitor developments elsewhere, but also with other Central banks, and experts advise you to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision-making is more art than science, "" said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the management of the assets of the company Envestnet, Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reaction to financial market movements, which are not associated, apparently, with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de is committed to an increase in interest rates, the quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings", in spite of limited discernible impact on growth in the United States," said Lacker.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the Market meltdown in 2008 in the first place, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for interest rate setting by the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turbulence will not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You don't want to certainly get to a Situation in which you fear a rate rise, because the markets get upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think you should rush ahead of the time.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly obese diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 Diabetes can take according to a new study a minimum of five years.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people live with Diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data require a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to shrink to the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce Hunger and the body to limit its own ability to take in food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 have proven to be Diabetes as efficiently, but most of the studies were conducted in people, the morbidly obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here you can calculate your BMI: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital the data that you have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 Diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who underwent this Operation, declined from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those, the non-surgical Diabetes treatments received approximately the same at 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who underwent a surgical procedure, dissolved in 36 % of the Diabetes disease completely, and 28 % partially.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically-treated group disbanded in comparison, the Diabetes is complete only in the case of a percent, and partially in only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results were at the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-cholesterol ", in General, better in the 'surgical' group," found the authors.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, remained stable at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - not decreased as reflected in the improvement in hemoglobin A1c level - the mortality rate in five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year of the Bypass surgery group had lost compared to the gastrectomy group, more weight (to 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3,1 % vs. 2.1 %) and experienced more of a complete Overcoming of the Diabetes (46,9 % vs. 16.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that Operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study was in obese people undergoing bariatric surgery to die is about 29 percent less likely to be in the course of 15 years, compared to a group, the more conventional methods tried.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no advantage for the Survival in the surgery patients, said Blackstone, it should be reassuring for those with a BMI under 35, who are interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this Operation group is in this lower BMI-lower", without the increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their Doctors should start to take weight seriously, as soon as the Patient lies with his BMI of between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once you have accumulated these genetic Changes, which have associated their body with obesity and Diabetes, is a reversal of really hard."</seg>

<seg id="20">"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could be for my child to be fatal.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products, or disinfectant wipes and store hand sanitizer out of the reach of the child.</seg>

<seg id="2">A little later today, except in the case of a late legal Intervention, I can see how a man to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope it happens, I'm going to sit in a spectators gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at the time of his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was made already, for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day grew closer, I began to fear me.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed, because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery, to decide who is elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who is selected, observe it without emotion.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't do this.</seg>
<seg id="14">I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossips a confined friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a Journalist, so it will not be allowed, a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I just have to try to remember all the Details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A Journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">They tell the story of the detainee, as he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">You admitted that you "could have done better formulate", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had a Problem with some of the things I have said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He says to me, what I write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international Reporter is present to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If he dies, he thinks that the Publicity of this movement will help against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please stop the series of Podcasts, which I have made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to go back to all the Details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the fact.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I think that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly don't think there is enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I can't claim to be really objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters, to which you can apply.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man in an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals because of statements to the ring to fight</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has referred to criticisms of the Tackling his players as "Agenda-Setting" of the two Premier League favourites for the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees fighting the Storm players "ring in" with his Team during the high Storm-victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a veiled remark to the Storm Team, after his team had scored the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Prime example" of Rugby League and not "said, that the two from Queensland were too good" in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused on Tackling only on your "contact us".</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism from two of the leading trainers of his team him with confidence, because it meant that you were concerned to be from the Storm Team hit.</seg>
<seg id="7">"That appears again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke of fights on the ring, as you have us, 24:2 hit," said Bellamy on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we have changed throughout the year in our defensive System, or the techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact in the Tackles, to a real focus, and that has provided a turning point for us in the trend.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is now for three years there, and he obviously has to train a great team. He is not lose, therefore, likely to be accustomed to, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny to show up like this again and again this Season.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and his Mentor, recalled that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010, with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night, and how exciting your game," said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010, St George as a boring Team has been criticized, and Wayne said that he was going to take care of a fuck.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a Team that can play and that is what we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game you want to play, if you have this kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - each Team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that you can play.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build stronger confidence, because you say these things, because they are a bit worried to play against us play.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, you have not thought well of us, when it came to the Big Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also noted that the game Storm scored against the Roosters a higher result than the game Broncos against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game of the Broncos was a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20:18, there were two further Attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or make breaks, and no points to anything Exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, the game plans are.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you mention us, it means that we are in a Phase to you.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm Team has released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park. The ticket sale starts next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"</seg>
<seg id="2">The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.</seg>
<seg id="3">What's coming to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum seekers will continue to come according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the interior this year, according to Germany, according to a statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany even able to a Million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated in the face of unusual challenge and determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do this".</seg>
<seg id="6">What will happen to Germany, gives the following Overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Be used according to different forecasts between 350000 (as estimated by the Federal construction Ministry) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel-Institute) flats a year and the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is almost twice as much as in the past, is built (250000 dwellings).</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially in affordable rental properties: Year 60000 to 80000 falling out of social housing from Rent control, and particularly affordable housing will also apply to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal tree inisterin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) is planning to double the funding currently 518 million to a billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Much too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute: 80 000 social dwellings a year would need to occur and for the Federal government to invest should have a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Agree scientists, and Federal tree inisterin are therein, that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates by the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that in the long term, 55 percent of the Refugees in Germany, can be employed.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically according to their qualifications, to help you get started, writes Claudia Walter, project Manager for Integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the Integration of refugees is crucial, whether you find a job in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany it has given, according to Thränhardt a political turn: from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there used to be a labour ban for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced in February 2014 to three months, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seeker to a place of residence restricted.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the company of has - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view that refugees should be faster the access to the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="20">A big hurdle for the access to the labour market lack of knowledge of the German language.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of General and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies also show that the jobs to be taught most frequently through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The establishment of networks is therefore of the view that by Thränhardt, the Royal road to integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees parents give their children in the kindergartens, an estimated ten to 15 per cent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family still convince of the benefits of the nursery, and distributes the management handouts in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">The demand for teachers should rise as a result of the large number of refugees that would try the Berlin Senate to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more trade and technical schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries the students will be prepared without knowledge of the German language in the Welcome class to the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="28">But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from teachers, with only a qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">In them no defect, Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school administration says.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Deutsche Studentenwerk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no state of asylum seekers says or Tolerated the study - the only exception so far was Berlin, the Senator for the interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has abandoned its stance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studi willing refugees could be facilitated the access to higher education.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permit or toleration not receive benefits under the asylum seekers benefits act more, if you begin a course of study.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter do not get basically no student loans, as they fall under the circle of the bafög-entitled persons.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tolerated refugees had to have four years in Germany lived to be Bafög-entitled from 1. January 2016, this margin is reduced to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also, this funding gap needs to be closed, ask Steffen noise, Berlin state Secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should immediately get Bafög.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will in the future play a more important role, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many Religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should allow Islam to take over, with the same rights as you have, the churches, and the existing state-churches-to develop a new state-religions relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also important is the establishment of an Islamic would be welfare Association to take care of professionally to the newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="41">To the Right also duties.</seg>
<seg id="42">The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be ready with the state in many areas to cooperate and give him a certain amount of control to give options.</seg>
<seg id="43">This also includes the willingness to courageously against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday concern that religious conflicts could also be to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to play such conflicts in Germany, "to have immediately forfeited your right to dwell here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He suggested to translate the basic law in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration in the future will be much more even than it is today, a subject of the society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="48">This will also need to change the majority society, is the removal of discrimination and racism are becoming more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since less than a decade, anti-discrimination, and a General equality act.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, such as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and the authorities, the racist motive is systematically ignored.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups, non-white German long challenge and what international agreements such as the anti-racism Convention in Germany to undertake, must be in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful, and its new citizens to use their opportunities for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">Generally speaking, Germany was able to supply the previously expected refugees medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"What Man - Power and capacity is concerned, we create it," he told the daily mirror.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, this extra money must flow into the System.</seg>
<seg id="55">To avoid bottlenecks, calls Montgomery, to all comers at the time of registration, health cards.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services provided could later be the States of settled.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long term, it is highly questionable that so many people with the limited catalog of FOB off by the asylum seekers benefits act provides.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, especially with the language barriers with the Doctors to create.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are informed worse about their illnesses than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in clinics, in doctor's offices, interpreters would have to be over the costs of calls for you.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many of the refugees would be helped, but also with more General medical calls in the emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with a different diagnostic views.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, there is significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people to HIV awareness.</seg>
<seg id="64">With some of the other disease pictures of German Doctors come from their training but clear, says Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis, are not so difficult to recognize". And as for the shortage of Doctors, the refugees, perhaps even relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees were even Doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">To be able to practise, you must demonstrate your qualifications, and may again take exams.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the in Germany, incoming refugees, according to estimates by the Federal chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK) mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Particularly vulnerable refugee children, Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explained.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recently published study of the TU Munich shows that one in every five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany arrives.</seg>
<seg id="71">Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffers from, among other things, to the so-called Flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and death anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms of sleep - and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent that the symptoms would chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees, however, receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although the mentally ill, asylum-seekers can ask at the end of in the social services, a request for a psychotherapy, but the processing usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">In addition, would decide in the social services, mostly clerks or Doctors that are not trained for mental illness, whether treatment was necessary or not.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team-mates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger told Wilshere, that it was only September, and if his Rehabilitation goes according to Plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer at the European championship is certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current Problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season, according to a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the preseason had to go back.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This type of injury is not a threat to career," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">This may be from a purely medical point of view, true, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injury, when a player is trying, in the middle of the season to return.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is also an unpleasant pattern developing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 of different diseases of Wilshere, since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in only 65 of Arsenal 157 League games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, one of the two Premier League Clubs that have suffered the most injury to-day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and combat power to win," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body has stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the Play against Chelsea on Saturday against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a Rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu is likely to start Debuchy and Arteta.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and the players need to take a little breather," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites, through group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play areas with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 Games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with the Richter scale, and 3.2 were measured.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year it was the 10. in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season of the Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and the remains of the distant hope, driven to lead with his Management of the club its first European Cup Triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were in the year 2006 very close to it, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends: the Comedy Show that gives us serious lessons about male friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The Absence of similar representations in Shows is obvious, particularly in view of the fact, such as the need for men to open up, is now become more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year High prove.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three Times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an Effort to address the Problem, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to make the culture in question, which prevent men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is the heart of the battle, to master this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 High School students with depressive symptoms found that, if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, cut in half, a circle of mentally healthy friends, the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course you must have friends, a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of social media-led communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need for a strong, fun-loving, and to appear successful, even if in reality, the Isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what is what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, Image, social Status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - it is our inner longing for personal development and friendship, on our mental health a lot of in-depth impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">And like a video game inventor and billionaire, said recently, money happiness can't buy really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Nice thing about Friends was that this focus was also placed on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was not defined by his work but by his personality, which shone through the interaction of as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching Football in the cozy armchairs, and the longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the Knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if you keep often back, to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the Telefonseelsorge it to me said:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are at risk, has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men that contact us, do not often feel able to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old phrase, "I can handle it" has come a tremendous effect, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if to speak about problems openly."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the Shows that comes to my mind when I try, the longer-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">You presented very clearly the little moments of male bonding.</seg>
<seg id="21">So my objective outsider Status over the phone the people in the eyes of despair look like to help support the long term comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends with to celebrate the day in a completely new designed scenery, why not take your friends for a Drink in Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better yet, if you see in Starbucks, someone sitting around alone, give him a Smile and say Hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what a difference it could make their friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the whole of the 236 episodes of #Friends</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG, Malmö is the place to pull.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were, of course, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the Start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities, before they increased their lead when Cavani in the 61. Minute, a headed goal to open the scoring.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in group A, Paris needed a strong Start against the Swedish Champions as they strive for qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown Team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career already in the year of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good Start, to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three Changes in the Paris Team, which was able to hold on the weekend was a 2:2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the League, but he was upstaged in the fourth Minute through Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine winger has been referred to as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, as he was taken in the last month from Manchester United, and he suggested, why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass in behind the Malmo defence, before he graduated to Johan Wiland over beautifully into the far corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if someone believed that PSG would score a great victory, was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmo, Celtic beat them in a Play-off to reach this level, competed in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a Five-man defence and two lined up deep in the midfield, a difficult opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot from Thorsten kinhofer, far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34. A Minute went by, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG themselves were sometimes, with some misplaced passes and poor financial statements, not the least of Ibrahimovic, who bombed with no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, he showed a lot more skill, when he brought his teammates into the game, and it's a Pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria turned in a turn and shot, which is of Wiland in the 52. A Minute was drawn past the post ...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had a left-wing cross from Maxwell up fishing.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended all thoughts of the fact that Malmo could get back into the game, and only an excellent Intervention from Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, was able to keep the final score low, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his Team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have not only played in the Swedish League, which has the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualification games are not enough."</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game from you!</seg>

<seg id="6">At the beginning of the image for Otmar Alt, formulated in 150 motifs in his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes has received the 75-Year-old, but they are by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, The respective subjects adapted to the quite grim.</seg>
<seg id="9">About three years, Otmar has worked Old on his Bible project, for which he has a subjective, artistic choice from the many topics of the "book of all books".</seg>
<seg id="10">Created cycles dedicated to various topics, such as the stations of the cross, Plagues, commandments or our father.</seg>
<seg id="11">So he has fascinated several partners: the Lutheran publishing house, with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler-Verlag, with its emphasis on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And mainly because of the author Klaus Alte post, which has, on the basis of the painting with the respective passages in the Bible apart.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the Otmar Alt selected Bible passages and so to Today, in current contexts "translated".</seg>
<seg id="14">These lyrics are like a verbal mirror of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Are nestled between the Original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each of a set of the artist who formulated his own personal thoughts on the Situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewelry cover has Golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">The 75 allowed-Year-old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were at all a trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church-order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Since the education happened with the cane," remembers Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I tried to work through this, to tolerate me, perhaps, that with the Lord father."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern was to help the art in fast-paced time more important: "The perception of image worlds today is influenced by advertising, and is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is displaced.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have to show a desire and delight, of things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Images always have a bit of a Mystery and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this regard, I'm a dinosaur".</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt would like the viewer in the images "fall into it", you, discover and feel the power you have: "looking at The picture be compared To".</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus old post confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "to have always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like the way he conceives of his paintings to life".</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not pay attention to the Bible is complete, but the important to him, even mysterious topics selected.</seg>
<seg id="30">"That wasn't a cooperation at eye level", says old post: "Here are the pictures, the Text explains only". A pictures of Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation, "to deepen his life and to find freedom".</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts pictures speak for moehler in both the (biblical) language of love as well as responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="33">A part of the original paper and canvas images will be presented for the first time in an exhibition at the 15. November will be opened in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of great fashion show and a wax chamber of horrors: The Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has unveiled on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition on his work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: mannequins, human appearance, thanks to video projections, scary.</seg>
<seg id="4">You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits to the big Star of the fashion scene and that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture, because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Before, it was bleached and now it's real," said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), the of 18. September is to be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a Look about his Person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition of sound a bit like death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you die, you come to the Museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had previously been made in the canadian city of Montreal and in Paris Station.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the Director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a matter of tolerance, acceptance and the Vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the has hardly written overview at the end of the work of the man, the history of fashion, without ever training completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the Exhibition is not constructed, but it is a superbly choreographed a total work of art, for the lots of effort was put: to style the dolls, was hired for example, a dedicated Stylist.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons of Material have been carted off to the creators, according to the curator, Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the Start of the Oktoberfest, a special treat was yet to come: a Lederhosen Outfit with a corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He had always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little bit different, said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even Gaultier's old Teddy bear is on display in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">He is the first, timid fashionable steps of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he is not a good student, and bad at football) he has attracted to his Teddy, Bras and dresses, said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="22">To play with a doll, they would not have allowed his parents to him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Design of fashion he had taught later on.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier told me in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="2">Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to make meters.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace created in large quantity for customers, which Cover, for example, and curtains that have been further processed.</seg>
<seg id="4">This alone no longer works today, said Andreas Reinhardt, managing Director of the fashion tip in Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the Mode is again important.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a larger role, and was then supplanted by the home textile industry and is now being discovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt mentions a few examples: top in jewelry, accessories such as bags and in regional Costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even the so-called Vintage-fashion-inspired eras of past style the picture, this is a growing job potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Who operated in the textile industry in Germany, no niches, no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, you already make up half of all jobs.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip member is Plauen, together with nine other companies in the industry Association Plauener lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only you are allowed to carry the protected Label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the sales were broken.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade it is almost.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customer in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bulk goods are nowadays produced in Asia, much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains sold.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, the Export schwächle, currently Russia and the USA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Enough reasons, therefore, for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry Association is trying to score points through environmental awareness, such as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl explains in Falkenstein: "Since this year we carry a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and in a socially responsible manner".</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".</seg>
<seg id="21">Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger foreign office of West Saxon University of Zwickau - in the faculty of applied arts, and is specialized in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">Of the competition from the Asian region to oppose something, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">It takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think, especially economically," says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing Design will varies often only slightly, in order to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">Several years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snow ball top.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine embroiders in some Places, small beads.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener gold champion Bianca hall Bach wrought-Krauße was inspired by them: "Before, I could start with the traditional Plauener Spitze nothing".</seg>
<seg id="29">Now, you used the snow-ball top for your jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a complex process shaping the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"A lot of people in the Region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also provides in the United States, Australia, and Finland - and especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want to have a piece of memorabilia.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauener Spitze.</seg>
