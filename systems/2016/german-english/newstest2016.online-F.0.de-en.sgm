<seg id="4">Within the house the officials found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a hand written note, which were scratched on a white block: “Me it does to suffering, I in such a way wanted, I could cancel it, I loved Amy and her am the only woman, who ever loved me”. This stood according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed of Lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">It gave no reference that Lamb, which informed in two online courses for the delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled already 300 miles to the campus, where he shot and killed popular historical professor, according to the police Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police head Lynn Buford said that university employees heard a shooting around 10:18 clock.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime thereafter.</seg>

<seg id="9">The authorities try one day after the shooting in the university, which students and lecturers forced to hide itself behind closed doors still to provide a picture of it which Lamb motivated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Details, like also published by the investigators at both ends of the state, what students and employees, who could do it, stated, helped thereby, a picture of a talented to possibly draw but difficult teachers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they looked forward to its instruction.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in gau animal, where Prentiss died, said, it did not have history of the force or a criminal prehistory.</seg>

<seg id="14">Both informed in the department for social sciences and history, whose faculty covers 17 members, and many students visited courses of both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time there were some inclinations to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said, he seemed also a little excited and nervous, “as if something with him is wrong.”</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him that he had to do in the end the academic year 2014-15 with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had asked and with the fact had said the delta State University before for a leave for health reasons that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this year it informed only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Newest changes in employment policy university meant that the graduation, for which Lamb had so hard worked for it would not represent a warranty for an automatic way to an employment as a Assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University University of William LaForge said, it did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “it naturally gave somewhat in Mr Lambs conception.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Those are questions, which Lamb cannot answer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the escape from the campus the police of late Lambs trace found, when it brought in again in Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>

<seg id="32">They and their friends were in the High School, and he was the cool older chap, who tried some years to teach to her the guitar play.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was at that time the woman swarm.</seg>
<seg id="34">All girls melted away, if he were there”, said Hairston, now 40 and in Jackson Vorstadt's von Brandon resident.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were together obviously some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency call Lamb “I said my wife killed”, but there was no document of a marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, which lived with them in the brick house, which borders on a Bayou in gau animal.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was correct.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Stehen, said, they were before 15 years became divorced, but friends had remained and a daughter had, who was now 19 years old.</seg>

<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes maintenance co-ordinator with The Julep Room, a weakly lit up bar in close proximity to gau animal, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at the night 5 September for the last time, after Lamb had terminated his guitar and harmonica play terminated before a meager audience.</seg>
<seg id="48">There were no signs for the fact that did not tune something.</seg>
<seg id="49">“, He said simple only one happy couple”.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were at clearing up and joked with one another.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, her had both a good sense for jokes.</seg>

<seg id="62">Of Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in new Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This history was corrected, in order to against-reflect the fact that the police says now that Lamb made the emergency call, after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb in its emergency call called Prentiss its wife, but a reference to it does not give it that the two ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll ratings, which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some tried to brand it as flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others shrugged off it than a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some wait for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter, as some republicans try, to Donald Trump of upper ranks with surveys to pull downward, it (still) did not function.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two digit range lead, and some began to ask oneself seriously what for the opportunities of the nomination of the real estate Moguls means it.</seg>
<seg id="7">Naturally it is still too early in the electoral period.</seg>
<seg id="8">None states that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys's guidance was transferred to ascending Herman Cain, from whom no only a state during the nomination process won.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons, why he would have to fight in a general choice.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative branch of economic activity club for Growth recognize now Trumps staying power and begin to let their dollar flow in order to fall it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some current poll ratings, which point to the fact that the real estate Mogul is not only a temporary phase:</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumps of popularity values 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Briefly before Donald Trump announced its candidacy in the middle of June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten republicans positively saw the real estate Mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">To in the middle of July there was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August were there 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now six of 10 republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three of ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers hold themselves in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa stated last week that 60 percent of the republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a survey of CNN/ORC last week said 67 percent of the republicans, they would be enthusiastically” or “content” either “, if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two of 10 say, they would be “annoyed”, if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say, they would be “enthusiastically” vs. 40 percent, which said the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in things enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other side it says 47 percent of the republican voters that they would be dissatisfied” or “annoyed” “, if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of the republicans does not see Trumps temperament as problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is criticized far away for his bombastic and insulting statements, thus ABC News/Washington Post believe 52 percent the Irish voter that the real estate Mogul has the correct temperament for a president, tending to the republicans, on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is valid for the Federal State Iowa in the first preselection state of the nation, where the same 52 percent of the republicans it thinks that he has the personality for a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless it thinks 44 percent that he does not have the personality, in order to implement effectively its office, and of 10 independent ones say that its temperament does not fit into the white house, thus ABC/post office to nearly six.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get accustomed to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If they put their scholar hats on, Trump consider republican voter material.</seg>
<seg id="34">If they are asked, who wins earliest the GOP nomination, it says four after a survey of CNN/ORC from the past week of ten that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">That is a change for the time, when four of ten at the end of July set their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time in the last cycle four thought from ten republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination opposite only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">It shows up nevertheless that Trumps campaign view a variety of GOP voters as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the republicans collected themselves around another candidate, Trump strikes still nearly everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the splintered field probably contributes to Trumps guidance, while the anti Trump support is vaguely distributed on more than one dozen of other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of Septembers shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other republican candidates, Trump harvests the majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has 13 points lead, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Carly Fiorina before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a neck-and-neck race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate, who strikes it?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overhaul the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A limited majority of Donald Trump fans says that they formed their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the voters, who support Trump say that they assigned their voices firmly.</seg>
<seg id="48">Naturally can happen much, in order to change, and nobody can really say to never change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">It said 46 percent that they leave the door open, in order to change to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Nevertheless Trumps is strongest competition for the moment the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters, who say that they formed their opinion, are twice as frequently for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump with the topic immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since then Donald Trump in its election campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico “rapist” called, was the immigration trick and pivot in the public discourse to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some it are anxious that the bombastic mode of expression will keep crucial hispanic away from Trump from the republican party and will damage the re-orientation efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But after the new ABC/post office survey of Monday six say of 10 republicans that they agree with Trump with questions of the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="55">As long as thus the immigration remains in the footlights, it will apparently also do to Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration over the government climbs on new highest levels.</seg>
<seg id="57">To Donald Trump and Ben Carson is allotted meanwhile approximately half of the support of republican voters, particularly by its outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six of 10 republicans say in the new on Mondays survey of ABC/post office, it want rather a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also furious on Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey of the Moines register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three are frustrated by four Iowa republicans over the republicans in the congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “infernally annoyed”.</seg>

<seg id="2">Who smokes, harms thereby not only the lung, but also the teeth - a Potsdamer suggests long-term study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good message: With renouncement the risk sinks fast.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early.</seg>
<seg id="5">That comes out from the long-term study of an international research team, among them several employees of the German institute for nutrition research (DIfE) in Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="6">Compared with nonsmokers the risk lay to lose their teeth prematurely around the 2.5 - to 3,6-Fache more highly with smokers.</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">Main causes for tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the gums, stress the DIfE.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this Periodontitis smoking is a factor of risk, stresses the authors.</seg>
<seg id="10">The connection between smoking and tooth loss decreases from there to more frequent gingivitises with smokers.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not clarified to what extent smoking increases also the risk for caries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Humans, who stopped with smoking, could reduce their risk however within a short time, write the researchers in the “journal OF Dental Research”.</seg>

<seg id="1">European Commission suggests new court in controversy over TTIP</seg>
<seg id="2">For defusing the controversy over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP the European Commission suggested an extensive reform of the current arbitral tribunal system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The disputed private conciliation facilities for disputes between companies and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which corresponds to traditional courts in its function mode clearly more.</seg>
<seg id="4">“We want to furnish a system, which the citizens trust, explained” the responsible European Union-commissioners Cecilia Malmström with the conception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede intends to bring the proposal as European negotiating position into the free trade discussions with the USA.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">From TTIP the largest foreign trade zone of the world with 800 millions of people is to result.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans for the reform of the current arbitration plan concretely that the European Union member states and the USA select together independent judges for a new investment Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="9">They are in equal parts from the European Union, which the USA originate and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Intended is for the first time also a second instance.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would permit it to raise against judgements objection.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far among themselves the procedure-taken part did not agree on arbitrator, an objection possibility against their judgements gave it.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the discussion of the past months that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in things fairness and justice, commentated Malmström became clear.</seg>
<seg id="14">On a long-term basis she wants to work towards according to their own statements on an international investment court.</seg>
<seg id="15">There then for example also disputes between Chinese enterprises and European Union member states could be clarified.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor state States of (ISDS), particularly required by large concerns, are considered as one of the principal reasons for the large resistance in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbitral tribunals by opponents as a kind parallel law criticized, over which enterprises compensation firstride debited to the taxpayers, national laws to circumvent or a lowering of consumer and environmental standards to implement can.</seg>
<seg id="18">In first statements anti TTIP organizations called such as Campact the proposals of the European Commission insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was criticized above all that they are not to be valid for the free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta), already negotiated.</seg>
<seg id="20">The German economic Secretary of State Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans however large progress.</seg>
<seg id="21">The commission considers substantial points, which Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel compiled in the spring with other European Union-Ministers of Trade with the reform.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system from private arbitral tribunals is from the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also the French government welcomed the plans of Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European enterprise federation BusinessEurope warned to limit the complaint possibilities of the economy by too many new rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by it, it were said.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the discussions can be concluded over the free trade agreement TTIP (Transatlantic trade and investment Partnership), remained on Wednesday further unclearly.</seg>
<seg id="27">The negotiations run since in the middle of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The topic investor protection was so far however not discussed with the USA.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally a framework should already stand for end of this year for the agreement.</seg>

<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will rise, in order to place first of its six given questions shortly after noon, whereby its achievement is checked by the media probably and the labour delegates from the proximity.</seg>
<seg id="5">It demanded “fewer theatres and more facts” with this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has to leave also said that he can skip some meetings, in order it to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Corbyns guidance, because it comes to its appointment as the member of the shadow cabinet and to its speech on the TUC annual convention on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime the decision of the labour chairman has, on Tuesday during singing the national anthem with a commemoration ceremony to 75. Anniversary of the Battle OF Britain in silence to remain, provokes and is located criticism of a number of Tory MPs in the center of several title page Stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention on itself</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman of Mr Corbyn said, it would have “in respectful silence confessed” and it the “heroism of Royal Air Force in the battle of britain” had recognized.</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC in the Two Newsnight program, it the labour chairman guessed/advised to sing the national anthem “independently” of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of shade Ministers refused serving in Mr Corbyns top team and it refer thereby to differences with the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less as a sixth of the parliamentary party originally than leaders supported it.</seg>
<seg id="13">The political correspondent of the BBC Robin Brant says that political differences “stack themselves” also within labour after Mr Corbyns expressions for the position to the European union and delimitation with profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn said to the TUC conference that labour submits changes, in order to remove the whole idea of a delimitation altogether.</seg>
<seg id="15">Later Mr Smith, the shade work and pension Minister said hours that the party was “very clear” that it is only against the government plans to lower the delimitation from 26.000 £ to 23.000 £.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be a fifth labour chairman, who is David Cameron, since then he Tory boss, in the last decade over the Dispatch box in the parliament away opposite stands.</seg>

<seg id="18">The Islington North MP said that the question time of the prime minister is to confrontationally, and the fact that it will omit both “repartee” and arguing with barbs and itself instead made, itself on serious problems such as poverty to concentrate inequality and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, which will represent shade minister of economics him, if he does not participate - for example if Mr. Cameron abroad on the way is.</seg>
<seg id="20">It brought also the idea in the discussion that other colleagues seize occasionally the word, and that it John Bercow, whom spokesman of the House of Commons addressed, in order to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When it became in the year 2005 leaders, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to depart from the policy in the style of a “Punch theatre”, which is linked often with the question time of the prime minister. But later it granted some years that he had failed therein.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was on TV sent first in the year 1990, the question time with the prime minister became as most important barometers of the judgement of a leader and its guidance in the House of Commons and its position among its parliament colleagues, although critics argued, it a caricature had become viewed and required extensive reforms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash starts nativeness campaign for the fight against Aldi idea</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches against a Aldi marching-up in South Australia and western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesale dealer Metcash started a nativeness campaign, in order to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and western Australia before 700 million a $ Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets their relations strengthen with local food suppliers and develop the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media, just as over event as Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA resellers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo out of Dunsborough, that in IGA shops samples distributed and shopkeepers, which sell reduced in price tickets for the South Australian football league to faithful customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that Metcash publishes further details of its defense strategy on 29 September, if the wholesale dealer for food, alcohol and devices accomplishes his annual investor strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">It stands much on the play, since South Australia and western Australia constitute nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA Ladengeschäften and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the east states.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and western Australia are notoriously provincially and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share as in new South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in western Australia compared with approximately 14 percent in the east states.</seg>
<seg id="9">However analysts believe such as Morgan Stanley that Aldi will snap twelve months after opening of its first markets approximately five percent of the food product market in these two states and all existing participants, but mainly independent retailers of sales will take away.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to this week published report the analyst estimated Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers could lose 360 $ millions revenue per year and Metcash 250 million $ to end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prognosis is based on the acceptance that Aldi will obtain in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA open and a revenue of 500 million $ and 600 million $ in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocer's shop and with the quantities on Metcashs of high fixed costs basis could to Metcash approximately 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes cost, said Mr Kierath.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time Metcash loses market shares in the east states, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recently accomplished survey of Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most faithful.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs revenue will fall in the food and grocer's shop by 3,8 percent in the year 2016, by 4,1 percent in the year 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10,3 percent to 2020 will reduce.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week told the prominent fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder Magellan Financial Group, with a business meal in Melbourne that Metcash probably within one decade. Metcash will disappear.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash rejected it to react publicly to the comments of Mr Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But one assumes a member of the board of Metcash with Mr Douglass took up last week contact.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAs market share sank since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and an income from Metcashs food and food trade, which supply about 1,200 IGA retailers, is since 2012 around 43 percent please, what with simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins reflects the operational reduction of debts.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wholesale dealer resists however and invests more than 150 million $, in order to adapt and improve IGA retailers with the improvement of their shops by faster growing fresh food to selling price with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products each week and to supply a better selection at private label food.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs managing director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop schemes of reconstruction at energy will add and hope that the wholesale dealer will return in the year 2017 for the first time in four years again to a profit growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis earns rather praise as criticism for its behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one the “collateral damage” in the recent storm approximately around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned in opinion of the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy rather praise as criticism for its own behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, which is designated again and again than “special Ks”, came by the notorious argument of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka with the Montreal of Masters into the footlights.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualification play in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, whereby Harrison proclaimed: “Wawrinka would have had to strike Kyrgios, and I should strike the child.”</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was seen last, how he smashed a tennis racquet, after a cramp defeated a potential US-Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy steadfast was defended.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is at present in Glasgow, in the competition with SAM Groth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">“A thing, over which I get excited rather, is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi a little was pulled in into the controversy,” said Healy.</seg>
<seg id="9">It broke a racquet, when he lost because of a cramp into the US-Open, but he is not the first player, who broke a racquet from frustration with itself, and I know Thanasi well enough, in order to know that he is not proud on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has himself into the US-Open extremely well held back, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he earns much acknowledgment.</seg>
<seg id="11">It has a great team around itself, it has a great family around itself, and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is very more ripely 19-year old, it works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he ever a problem with the other players had, he within the coat range was not respected, he trained hard, he is well in form, he is a very sturdy and matured young chap, and I believe, he earn it by its own earnings to be judged.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy supported also the decision not to consider Kyrgios during the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday, and he describes the “common decision” as the correct for all, but he assures to the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm component to the team.”</seg>
<seg id="14">“First we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversies [Kyrgios],” it said approximately to Healy.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I believe that nod very fast the ascent created, on which people referred such as Federer and Murray. It rises in the eyes of the public, and he has some bad errors made and earned all the criticism, which he gets, but we to try to support it we to try, to make for it the consequences of its acting understandable. Some consider time outside of the footlights, in which he can only think about it, I appropriate, and it is best for the crew and it is the best for it.</seg>

<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban insisted however on the fact that most arriving economic refugees are, who are in the search for a better life, and not war refugees, who have requirement on protection - an opinion, which stands for Germany strongly in the contradiction to other European Union member states, under it.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which went in effect around midnight in Hungary, make a crossing of the border or a damaging the 4-meter (13 foot) of the high fence, the government let which build along the southern border to Serbia, a crime.

<seg id="1">Wahl-2016: Hillary Clintons's lead over Bernie Sanders in national survey halves</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton holds further a two digit lead in democratic running around the nomination on a national level, but senator Bernie Sanders gains it opposite ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton has now the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters with the primaries (58 percent before), while Sanders in second place stands, with 27 percent (rise around 17 percent).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice-president Joe Biden, who did not announce yet, whether he stands as a candidate for the presidential office, receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before beginning of the primaries to say say most democratic voters that it is too early, in order that their opinion is certain, which candidates it will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clintons supporters are steadier in their choice than those of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS news survey has Clinton with a set of demographic groups lost, while Sanders obtained some profits.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a large lead with women and self-control, but these leads were reduced.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support with the men sank clearly, and Sanders is past here only with 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clintons advantage with democratic voters under 50 years evaporated, and they and Sanders now are on same height.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton has however still another large lead with the older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the past month Clinton was forwards Sanders with two digit lead with the liberals, but has Sanders now a lead of point of 5 at this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">Say about half of the democratic voters of the primaries country-wide that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, if them were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support it with some reservations and would only support further 15 percent it, because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">They would not support six percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprising that Clintons current supporters are enthusiastic by it particularly.</seg>
<seg id="17">The opinions are more strongly mixed with those, which do not support at present Clinton - only about a quarter them enthusiastically to support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While it says 48 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, says less republican voters this about her leading candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clintons supporters in an open question are asked, why it is to want that she is the candidate, the most frequent answer that she has the correct experience (16 percent), followed from the opinion that it is time that a Mrs. Präsidentin becomes (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">By Clintons supporters also its connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Agreement to handling the problems and the eligibility are also quoted.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since the vice-president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scale pan, it would like 57 percent of the democratic voters of the primaries it in running to see - although a third believes that it should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If democratic voters of the primaries are asked, who for the party its second choice would be, is Biden at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of Clintons supporters more than half say that Biden would be far their second choice forwards Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">If Biden decides not to stand as a candidate for the nomination of the democrats Hillary Clintons's lead increases forwards Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in running.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the choice; however this number of 78 percent sank in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is with distance second when this measurement, but the percentage, which views him as the “most selectable”, rose.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, with the question about it, which is more important with a candidate, democratic voters call questions over the eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similarly as in the last month not one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the primaries stands out as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The democratic candidates or potential candidate furnish good results with some important characteristics with voters of the primaries of their party.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities equipped.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden cuts with the three candidates best off with honesty, while Clintons strength is the guidance.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say over the Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have in addition no opinion of it.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters of the primaries see generally also Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in agreement with their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="35">When all these measurements about a quarter of the democratic voters does not have an opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since questions are further placed to Hillary Clintons's use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as a Foreign Minister, most democratic voters of the primaries are content with their explanation of the affair and to say that it did not affect its opinions altogether.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is another history in the American public altogether.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of the Americans is now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third is content.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public opinion for this was split in March, briefly after the problem came to the light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said the fact that the email controversy did not have effects on its general opinions of Clinton although said 36 percent that its opinion of it had still worsened.</seg>
<seg id="41">There is mainly republicans, more than six of 10, which says that its opinions of Clinton became worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is viewed of the voters of its party as honest and trustworthily, this is further a problem for it among registered voters altogether: Only 32 percent they see as honestly and trustworthily, to eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less for May.</seg>
<seg id="43">They do not regard 62 percent of the voters as an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time country-wide also Trump do not view 55 percent of the voters as honestly and not trustworthily.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump receive however good notes with guidance.</seg>
<seg id="46">From the six tested candidates fare Biden, Carson and Bush best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority views Sanders rather as honest, but as with Carson have many no opinion of it.</seg>
<seg id="48">The error rate for the sample of 351 democratic voters with the primaries amounts to 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Nearly two years, after a student died during a ritual using chicanery of a students' society in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, are submitted charges of murder against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New Yorker Baruch College pi-delta-psi-Bruderschaft attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 brutally and delayed its transport in the hospital, which contributed to its death, communicated the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said, he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30-Pfund-Rucksack full sand, and repetitive attacked, while he tried to go over a frozen field toward a goal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng complained finally about headache, then it fell down unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the pi-delta-psi-Bruderschaft did not call for the emergency number 911, after Deng became unconscious and waited allegedly one hour, before they brought it into a hospital, so the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">They had however the time, in order to change Dengs clothes to google its symptoms and Andy Meng to contact the national president the brother shank in order to catch up advice, said police head Chris Wagner at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">“At this point the members began to hide implements and placed the well-being the brother shank in principle over from Michael Deng”, said police head Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">It could not be revived, and he died on the next morning at his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report Deng were added repetitive with blunt strength injuries at head, trunk and thigh.</seg>
<seg id="11">“Too many families were destroyed by the harassment the brother shank. At least one student dies since 1970 each year at the harassment”, said Douglas Fierberg, an attorney, who represents Dengs family, in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Bruderschaften and their members must be pulled to the account, and this step of authorities is very important.</seg>

<seg id="1">That will happen, if the Fed increases the interest</seg>
<seg id="2">An increase in interest comes, and the boom will come into staggering, net yields for loans will become will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know.</seg>
<seg id="4">Which we do not know are, how last long that everything and how long will stop it.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular history offers only small instruction for the economy for execution.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within only 11 months to the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of Federal Reserve with the raising of the interest rates often is, if also not always, a factor thereby how the economy and the financial assets react.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore representatives of the US-central bank stressed so violently that investors should not concentrate on when them begin to increase the interest rates but rather on the period, which is needed for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">Indeed several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end market players could state however that the whole excitement was possibly exaggerated because of an increase in interest.</seg>
<seg id="11">“The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted inevitably of some as a signal for the end the era “of the cheap money””, said Julian Jessop, Chefökonom with Capital Economics, in a report at customers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast to it we expect not the gradual return of the US-interest to normal heights, but still on too low level, in order to the seismic shock, which many seem to be afraid to lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">That means however not that it will not give effects.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a view of, based on historical trends how some ranges of the economy could react:</seg>
<seg id="15">How the market saw in the last month, the anticipation of increases in interest can make things for one while volatile.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">“There is apparently a tendency that receipts from capital 12 to 24 months after the first increase are strangled, which reflects, said perhaps again the delay in the monetary policy” German bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after increases in interest of the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="18">More exactly said, the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2,6 percent), then back to the normal condition after 500 days, with an average net yield in the past six cycles of 14,4 percent, passed, according to a current analysis, which Bob Doll, boss investment strategist with Nuveen ate management, with Barron's published.</seg>
<seg id="19">It said Deutsche Bank that the effects arise tendentious later on the shares in the increase cycle and the net yield begins to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of the economic life, but increases in interest often promote them.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case the Fed is confronted with some conditions, which there were not before and which could to accelerate a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Extremely remarkably it is here that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point during an increase in interest of the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank only twice the nominal Gross Domestic Product was below 4,5 percent with the 118 increases in interest since 1950.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter was 2015 with 3,6 percent, only few expect that this will persist and to expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Increases in interest with a so fragile economical backdrop could be risky and throw the question up, “whether it this time different are”, said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market players made themselves calm all year on an increase in interest of the Fed, and all eyes were this week directed toward the meeting of the federal open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economist believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade indicates only a probability of 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">“In our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a supercycle with increasing momentum at the Gross Domestic Product and prerecession heights very fast after the beginning of the recovery outshone”, so the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast to it this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was in the observed phase.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The firm income was also volatile, since the market anticipates an increase in interest, and the sample is rather similar as on the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is the fact that the effect is faster with loans than with shares if changes its strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">With loans the net yields seem to change the direction, as soon as the first increase/lowering takes place in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the end the increase cycle the loan net yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="35">The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise will lead with the interest rates to the fact that net yields between longer and shorter loans move closer together closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-interest-bearing loans bring often in such a climate better yields, although “we are still careful, higher yields to expect”, said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst with Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">, Means Jones is interesting that the markets already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">“Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decrease of inflation expectations there are some signs for the fact that the market to the prospect on stricter monetary policy adapted” wrote her.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rose, the yield curve is flatter, credit breakdowns expanded and volatility rose - all characteristics of the market, if the Fed intensifies its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the whole enterprises, which complete the larger part of their business activity in the USA, will profit from it, if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational enterprises with high debts will more badly stand there, there a rising dollar their products on the global market make more expensive and likewise the financing of their debts.</seg>
<seg id="42">“History shows that “quality “shares bends to extremely positively react three months after a initial increase in interest” said Goldman Sachs-Analysten in a report for the customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance exceeded enterprises with weak balance on the average after each of the increases in interest 1994, 1999 and 2004 around 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Enterprises with high capital net yields as well as low volatility with its shares exceeded also her counterparts with bottom quality around on the average in each case 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debts become a large problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Enterprises with a high portion of flexible interest will lose at most, said Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of the pure share plays consumer will likewise profit by the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits by higher yields, even if experts of different opinion are, how quickly that will take place.</seg>

<seg id="5">Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the transmission The Voice and said that this was not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC radio 3 “changes itself” to Classic FM, maintains a prominent member of parliament and increases new pressure to the transmitter to prove that it does something, to what the private stations does not do.</seg>
<seg id="7">The conservative delegate Andrew Bingham said also to the BBC bosses that the public radio station “hebetates” and increasingly no more from its commercial competitors to is not to be differentiated.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Radio 3 seems - I do not use the word “hebetate” gladly - however it seems to Classic FM to transform”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="9">It aimed also at the BBC Music Awards, which started in last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, The Brits seem to be only under another name.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus to do, if you try, something else - these are two examples spontaneously specified, with which you imitate actually only that, which on the market is already”, said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC general manager rejected the reproaches and argued that BBC radio 3 lay far before its commercial competitors, if it concerns live music and clearing-up of the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">Which I learn from radio 3, which I will not differently learn over classical music anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment for live music and making music, which are really unsurpassed.</seg>
<seg id="15">“And the commitment of radio 3 also real to find and new works in order give new music, consider I important”, said he.</seg>
<seg id="16">Beginning of this year argued BBC radio 3 CONTROLLER Alan Davey that harder had to be worked to engage the audience when it did this in the past, because the British are informed about classical music less.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3 was not however the only element of BBC production, which came during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sport under fires to step the commercial rival on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Tory delegate Damien Collins seized The Voice on the musical talent show of the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.</seg>
<seg id="19">Do you see, why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly saliently?</seg>

<seg id="21">It added, it desires that the enterprise finds “a hit from our internal stable”, if it starts next time an entertainment series.</seg>

<seg id="1">Functionaries of Aich/Dob because of unfaithfulness in court</seg>
<seg id="2">At the district court Klagenfurt had themselves to answer for on Wednesday two functionaries of the Austrian volleyball vice-master Aich/Dob because of unfaithfulness and delivery evasion.</seg>
<seg id="3">The accused did not admit itself guiltily.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of them had been accused of office abuse also.</seg>
<seg id="5">From this reproach it was validly acquitted in May.</seg>
<seg id="6">The current process was postponed.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to senior public prosecutor Robert Riffel had itself in preliminary investigation crystallized out that the accused used in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of club accounts, of which they were allowed to make arrangements in their functions for private purposes.</seg>
<seg id="8">It numbers the damage with approximately 400,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sport functionaries are accused also of financial offences.</seg>
<seg id="10">This fact separated the chairman of the juror senate, judge Michaela Sanin.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is to be negotiated at a later time.</seg>
<seg id="12">To the Verwurf of the unfaithfulness the defense stated that at no time a financial damage had developed for the club.</seg>
<seg id="13">The sport functionaries would have charged only representational allowances and would have led the sport club out, for which they would have been active from 1982 to 2011 and would have invested into them much time and money, from the debts - liabilities amounted to in the year 2001 approximately 600,000 Schilling (about 44,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="14">“At that time we stood before the situation: Do we would drive on the club or lock we? ”, one told, in the bread profession large-scale enterprise examiners of the tax office to the accused.</seg>
<seg id="15">With its colleague and codefendant he decided then to take over this task.</seg>
<seg id="16">With all risks.</seg>
<seg id="17">“We advanced money, said our life insurances as security with the bank put down”, it with the examination.</seg>
<seg id="18">With the club one agreed upon: They can administer the money freely, it may only no debts be made.</seg>
<seg id="19">Further - with appropriate financial - success the disbursement of the representational allowances was decided retroactively to 1991.</seg>
<seg id="20">Therefore one paid off a part of the representational allowances only years later, i.e. starting from the year 2003, than a plus on the account was.</seg>
<seg id="21">Therefore also overall and not seemed detail deductions up, described the former chairman the procedures.</seg>
<seg id="22">The accounts and passbooks administered the two accused together, said the second accused.</seg>
<seg id="23">Why the disbursements the club were not revealed in detail, the judge asked.</seg>
<seg id="24">The club does not have itself in the detail in finances interested, important only the free from debtness was, so the answer.</seg>
<seg id="25">When in the year 2011 against the one functionary investigations began because of office abuse, an amount was transferred by 120,000 euros to the club account.</seg>
<seg id="26">That reserves were, explained the accused.</seg>
<seg id="27">This securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not well-known according to its statement the club.</seg>
<seg id="28">“Why? ”, the judge wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="29">Whereupon the asked one knew for a long time no answer.</seg>
<seg id="30">Then he finally meant, he had believed that this is the best for the club.</seg>
<seg id="31">If had somewhat happened to it, nobody would have known something from this money, placed the public prosecutor into the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">The codefendant was informed, justified themselves the functionary.</seg>
<seg id="33">This transfer was formulated as “damage compensation”.</seg>
<seg id="34">Why damage amend? , judge and public prosecutor wanted to know.</seg>
<seg id="35">Whereupon the first accused, it explained had not agreed with this formulation, because never a damage developed for the club.</seg>
<seg id="36">But which I am to do, if the lawyer says: “Are with that you all off the hook”.</seg>
<seg id="37">“Am I a legal representative? ”, he asked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Further the functionary, it said had never a cent content had referred, had charged it only kilometer money and diets.</seg>
<seg id="39">At diets it charged for 1,000 euros per month to the club, was the actual expenditure however much more highly, added it.</seg>
<seg id="40">Exact documents for the early years could not show the accused.</seg>
<seg id="41">These were not kept after an audit of operating results, in which everything was judged as correct, no more, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="42">Kilometer money had referred also the second accused.</seg>
<seg id="43">All recoveries took place in cash, in addition it had to drive from its residence people market to the bank to lead castle, explained it in its statement.</seg>

<seg id="1">Surely does David Cameron The Lorax know better?</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a thing, which all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not for a long time last, until you know it nearly by heart.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is, you is perhaps David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When it was asked of a provider of child care systems to call its favourite children's book the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: “hilariously, moving, creatively and with a strong message to always give it is a book, which I read out gladly to my children, because it seems a picture or a message which we missed so far.”</seg>
<seg id="6">Everything beautifully and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron describes allegedly the action of the book, instead a summary of the film version of 2012 shows, which new characters and details added, to extend in order the rather short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">“In the midst of the ummauerten city Thneed Ville, where all nature went and even air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams by its desire to see a genuine tree fulfilled”, reading one. An interest of love was to Dr. Seuss, whose correct name Theodor Seuss hostage read and to who 1991 died, however completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that would be suspicious not yet enough: The text submitted by Cameron reads itself partly like the summary that of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website by Internet Movie DATA base and begins in such a way: “In the ummauerten city Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams.”</seg>
<seg id="9">Although it admits yes, a pragmatic father to be, it seems improbable that Cameron the action of the book is so little familiar. Here a unnamed boy, how the local environment by the money-hungry, trees fällenden, hears Thneed knitting Once more ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, schnurrbärtigen nature, “in the name of the trees speaks”, is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">In all probability such was delegated a relatively low PR-task to an aide, that did not read out The Lorax 20 times one behind the other a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text had probably come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's employees, gave however no further direct comments.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly threatened from the exclusion from of England crew, but it is still heavy</seg>
<seg id="2">Pakistan in the united Arab emirates to discover, is a difficult task, but if one sees the cadre, which England for the tour selected, a repetition of the 3-0 test series defeat does not stand on my map.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not exclude an away victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cooks's side is possibly less experienced than before three years, but there are good spin players in the Batting list, and the team spirit is strong; they will not carry scars of 2012, only a juvenile-positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball Moeen Ali develops as spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size on test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">On that referred message: Adam Lyth is ruled out from the England test cadre and by Alex Hales is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to omit Adam Lyth is natural for me as its coach in Yorkshire to analyze with difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="8">With its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple, but harsh reality is that cricketers are aligned to results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks with Joe's roots, for example, and player led its own best choice devices is to the nomination, there - and I had a while ago said this -.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago one would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own fate.</seg>
<seg id="11">If it drives hopefully further runs out for Yorkshire, a further opportunity comes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he did not furnish so good achievements, and does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question, how much time a test Schlagmann receives, in order to set its indication, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven opportunities - like SAM Robson before it -, while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the opportunity to home and away games.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only reproach, which one can raise, was that England used first Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in top form - however this lost opportunity lies now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and it is a Schlagmann, which I estimate highly.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is a X-factor-Cricketspieler, which we saw with Yorkshire early in this season, when he obtained 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, what us much met.</seg>
<seg id="19">It must at least receiving the same opportunities as before him, but this depends naturally on the team selection in the united Arab emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea to let Moeen beside Cook strike which would receive a extra spin Bowler to furnish and four Quicks, emerged, and I did not have anything against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see, why a Schlagmann cannot strike there, and this left-handed person already showed that it is a hotshot of Cricket player.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen did not settle but is perhaps its job for its County Worcestershire, it a number 3 for it, and there there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests with the first drop, before he appeared to 2001 as Opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">It created and did not look back three hundred of run immediately not.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a BACK-UP crank, and in my limited handling him he impressed me as a young man very much.</seg>
<seg id="26">People see themselves possibly its statistics on on the average to 31 with the racquet and 35 with the ball - and to think, it is a Punt, but there is no large number of backup cranks, who raise their hands and coaches have themselves for youth decided which.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn on this tour a quantity.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the crew England made a few intelligent additions at the training staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as advisors for the test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is one the nice Estonian of chaps of the play, which will bring along an abundance of experiences, since it played under all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase the tour and brings energy and a strong employment in the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I felt always already that he is creative for the international Cricket competition, when players or as a coach, and how Mahela has he insights, from which we can profit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing room, even if the news stands in conformity with before the saying.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys team colleague with Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used with the One Dayers, to roots did not receive a similar break against Australia and I for my part has no problem thereby.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but Coaches and team stand-up displays do not determine the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not made light heart.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of Great Britain from the European Union) could win at inlet, if the economy comes up to the year 2017 into a calm air</seg>
<seg id="2">David Camerons's ill-considered renegotiation strategy, in order to hold Great Britain in the European Union, with each day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “is it will more deeply in trouble turn out yes or no?” Corbyn to the leader of labour or the TUC, which fell out themselves because of Europe on Tuesday violently.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states, into different crises, as the European Union it is as deeply involved just and not always from own debt, of Great Britain provided agenda with split concessions and disturbing contract modifications, which would mostly not like it are full.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton the TUC decided on its annual meeting that it does not like these also, if they endanger the social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could call Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda it also.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime ministers and Ministers of Finance climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of itself before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come then home and say that it allied for reforms wins.</seg>
<seg id="8">It always concerns me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, after outside looking Great Britain inside the European Union-tent wishes - “leave us not alone with France”, says Berlin - and lets see through that more and more short-sighted Ministers and official came in some capitals up to the point, at which it them is all the same whether we remain or to go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Of Germany carefully deliberated chancellor Angela Merkel is an allied one, but she is for 10 years at power and wants the office to leave, before it looks bad for her, as with long enduring exaggerated it such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">Of France François Hollande looks on his re-election or his replacement in the year 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is also a fading strength.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland has possibly soon a nationalistic right government, Spain a left.</seg>
<seg id="14">It falls heavily to introduce itself that they will peel themselves off a leg, to prevent in order to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be used better for it, Scotland withdrawal from the UK - something that it also not to want, because most similar separatist tendencies have.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore possibly some such Ministers do not plan even intentionally helpful notes, completely in the SNP style, during of Great Britain referendum campaign 2017, in order to accelerate the Brexit process, assume my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">“The renegotiation was not a failure” and “Great Britain anything from value from the renegotiation won.”</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know, how can be predatory Fleet Street at their expense and which European Union-sceptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, how they were it during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn 1975 however not, our entrance 1973 with a relationship of 2:1 supported.</seg>
<seg id="18">They can itself weakly at Boris Johnson, whom remind ore euro-opportunist, who made itself a name as “European Union-straight line-bananas” a Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.</seg>
<seg id="19">With all its madness OD Miliband knew, who its enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">In addition belonged the Medley of tax fear rogues, telephone-chopping foreigners and the pseudo non--residents, who possess most of our large newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually Tony Blair thought similarly of it, it determined however that, if one sits with a hot gorilla in a cage one distributes better bananas to become in order to divert it, instead of its lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed was Miliband of more Blairianer than Blair themselves, than he opposed Cameron's referendum eddies, because the principle had placed to Blair over the not adopted condition of the European Union, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in the year 2005, who opened thereby a back door for him.</seg>
<seg id="23">Die Presse also never forgave it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But nice Jeremy Corbyn, that me on Monday in Westminster a friendly flip on the backs gave - I said to it that he no more time for me to waste need - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's an error at that time and today.</seg>
<seg id="25">It can last, but it does not have to develop a coherent strategy, in order to win the media, with me, but surely with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyns official position to Europe actual I presses it times friendly out in the development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Now, which can probably say most humans outside of Ukips traditional woad tendency and the wilder realms of Torys Klein-Engländerismus to everyone to it yes.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is what Hilary “a Benn, but no Bennite” Benn in the radio and on TV this week said, when the scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provoking John McDonnell was as shade chancellors a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70's, when its old father endeavored itself on TV to be disloyal opposite his labour colleagues from the cabinet without too far to go and its cabinet job lose.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilarys fight was still more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But to fight, in order to remain “under all circumstances” - Benns expression - what said McDonnell, was still which JC its fellow combatants and delegates after all reports on its closed conference on Monday evening told.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the tear-jerking Bottom UP image of Corbyn to arrange wants - to think it to the fact that it agitated even me - news discipline remains around the clock important and first of all in the age by TV in the vortex of the social media, a breeding place by paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is correct to give to Cameron no free ticket for Europe it permitted to hold Labours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course how McDonnell said it.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins thinks surely in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities to EU membership - in conformity with its Bennite FE storage economy, her anti-capitalistic past - is no longer only one question of the esoteric discussion under left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to the withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try in everything a sense for their superiors at home to find.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital to make - they have also distrustful voters - around concessions on the British if all of this can be senseless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The USA are already rather disappointed by the weak military achievement in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria, even with a reduction of costs of the Tory government at power, that I was reminded when starting on Monday by something, what British Influence Security forum called themselves.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize report of Public Health England over E-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Statements of a state-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than a smoking developed from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts, who write in British Medical Journal (BMJ), followed Lancet, by criticizing the proofs used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report over e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the “fundamental report” in the past month and describes it as a “comprehensive examination of the proofs”.</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers placed and referred the maximum stress of the data in question to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">A editorial in the medical technical periodical Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy basis”, on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the statements develop “on stone or sand”.</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor for European Öffentlichde health to London School OF hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor for clinical epidemiology at the University OF Liverpool, said: “A basic principle of the public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of the effectiveness.”</seg>
<seg id="9">They said the fact that the public expects that the statement of PHE that “the present best estimation is that E-cigarettes are less harmful about 95% than a smoking” on a detailed examination of the proofs and is based to the modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed this statement comes from only one meeting of 12 people, who became to call up to lead in order to develop a model for a multiple criterion decision analysis (multi-criteria Decision analysis - MCDA), in order their opinions across the damage from different nicotine haltigen products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said the fact that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was before to have received means (ASKED) for an independent study from British American Tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="12">He signed also the references of ASKED to the public health in a sustainability report, said her.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive means from a E-cigarette-manufacturer to but they did not add the financing, which it was to have received after reports before from the tobacco enterprise Philip Morris International.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied, but in addition several well-known E-cigarette-champions belong, from whom some also in the paper indicate a branch financing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants in this meeting are not admit for their know-how in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the meeting participated also the tobacco line of PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research work of the group “confesses characteristically” that there is a lack of “hard proofs for the damage of most products with most criteria”, wrote McKee and Capewell.</seg>
<seg id="18">However none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that the statements of PHE that “there are so far no proofs that E-cigarettes serve as a way to smoking for children or nonsmokers” prematurely were.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director for health and well-being with PHE, said that to the statements of BMJ one reacted already before.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: “E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than a smoking.”</seg>
<seg id="22">Each second lifelong smoker dies at his craze.</seg>
<seg id="23">All proofs put near that the health risks of E-cigarettes are small in the comparison to it, but that we have to study further the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has the clear obligation for the information of the public about what the proof occupies and which not, above all, if there is public confusion so much over the relative dangers in the comparison to the tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 humans die annually at an illness with reference to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the clear presentation of current proofs that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage, which is caused by smoking, fulfill we represent our national responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give EastEnders up, says former boss of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said, which should stop BBC to send programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rival would give “their right arm” for hit shows like Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only in order to make the kind from programs to, which are not sent by other UK-transmitters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for the fact that her public programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience to place into hard disputed time windows against popular shows of their rivals and from transmitters such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC general manager, Tony Hall, said, who wanted to do enterprise more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that it had tried six years long in its time with Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC into contact.</seg>
<seg id="6">“I have problems with the idea that BBC gives or sends programs in order, which were shown also clearly by not subsidized rivals”, said Johnson the upper house communication committee in the framework of its investigation about the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you liked to hold the broadcast fee, what I central or on a long-term basis for a good idea to hold, one should not its production at least on programs, which do not make or in order give others.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send The Voice in a first-class time window, because they want to achieve as broad a support for their future as possible.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that otherwise nobody would show this, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is naturally nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: “I do not see, why a regressive tax finances programs, which could be financed also without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, admittedly both own productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Honestly other channels were said their to right arm for it to give.</seg>
<seg id="13">I strive to see, how this public television is to be.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC debt at the hunt for evaluations was “because of the ambitions of humans, who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way, around long-term support to secure.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Its comments on popular transmissions the BBC show that, which the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in its MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh suggested in the year 2003 that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the rather public niche programs should go “to BBC4, where one cannot measure rather the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they cannot argue, if they go to radio licence fees on their hypocritical missions to the justification from 4 billion £, “now, naturally, we have all these obscure programs provided, the anybody saw.”</seg>
<seg id="18">They put it into a time window, in which nobody wanted to ever see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee: “I request you to find a rather regressive system regarding conditions who can obtain the best value from this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Naturally you think all, think we everything the fact that one obtains a large value for 150 £ per year here, but for people, which is for the 150 £ a quantity money, ask me whether is correct, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5-boss of David Elstein, who stated also before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC was to examine their Reithian mission to inform “to form and maintain”.</seg>
<seg id="22">He said, only little of BBC production officially as education was classified now - he said that 1% of its TV-production and 0.1% were in the radio - and them should take themselves in the public television stations in Australia and Canada an example this to change in “inform, clear up and maintain”.</seg>
<seg id="23">To the question of the partnerships said Elstein, the BBC should do more within ranges like those of the PROMs, of which he that only one handful said it is on TV shown and with which commercial transmitters alliances are received, in order all online to make available.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' can steer brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows, how the Nematoden changes the direction in the moment, in which it with sound impulses is illuminated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be steered by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny Nematoden changes the direction in the instant in that it with sound impulses, which have for the human hearing to high frequencies, in order to be heard to be illuminated.</seg>
<seg id="5">The impulses work by switching on on of motor neuron cells, which are genetically changed, in order to carry the diaphragm channels, which react to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further to this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said, who showed worms the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, with the ultrasonic be used can, in order a set of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body to activate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk of institutes in La Jolla, California, said an invasive procedure, which delivers electrical impulses into the brain from humans to the treatment of the symptoms of the parkinson's disease to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thread worms do not react usually to ultrasonic, but Chalasani stated that they did it, if they were surrounded with microscopic bubbles by a liquid.</seg>
<seg id="10">, He found, strengthens the blisters out the ultrasonic waves, which penetrate then into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The intensified ultrasonic waves affect structures, which are called TRP-4-Ionenkanäle and in the diaphragms of some the worm cells are found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells, they are assigned to which, such a report Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to create ultrasonic-steered Nematoden, Chalasani changed genetically the worms in such a way that some its TRP-4-Ionenkanäle carried for motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="14">If it applies ultrasonic to the changed creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the micro vesicles and transferred into the worms, where they switch on for changed motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, innovative tools, which make scientists possible, neurons with impulses of the light switch on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages in relation to this technology.</seg>
<seg id="17">Contrary to light, which must be down-sent to optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves fabrics can unhindered happen and know into the brain from above on the head to be sent in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="18">“We believe to make that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible, targeted the human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments”, said Chalasani.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, added it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for the life in student hostels</seg>
<seg id="2">Before eleven years pulled I as oblivious of all around one 19-year olds into a student hostel, still in the faith in Berets and moral relativism, but I remember only now the strained smile of those, which I annoyed - and to the numerous, long-winded complaints at others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most that I learned, can be distilled in eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The introduction into student hostels is enough from easily nerve-racking to absolutely alarmingly.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is enticing to be chatted: Humans tell, from where you come whether and where you took Sabbath year, where you hate you regarding Corbyn stand and why “honestly said Marmite neither dear nor, because in Ernst, boy, it is only one yeast excerpt HAHAHA, I am in my room.”</seg>
<seg id="6">Atmen Sie through.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you help others to do same - places you questions and show you interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">It directs the discussion and helps you to find humans out you likes contrary to those, with which you would not speak, even if your lashes started to burn and were these fire extinguishers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Leave to humans.</seg>
<seg id="10">The rooms of humans often transform into beverage receptions, film night of places of event and local meeting places, but they are also the places, in which humans dress and adjust their underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">Referred on that: Do not remember to begin at the university with a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverted ones receive a rough treatment at the university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Their room should be a refuge, but many student hostels form a space space strolling culture, which is friendly and social action and can to lifelong friendship lead.</seg>
<seg id="14">That can be hell for someone, which tries, to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture permits to tell you: “I like you, and I want that our friendship continues, but you must leave, so that I receive the energy back, which I used for the interaction with you.”</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel, when a fellow student of sociability exhausts actual and sends you him a SMS instead of to knock.</seg>
<seg id="17">Apropos knock: Do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A chap in my student hostels had the conception that a not locked door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Friendship close by cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since you begin the university on the high point of the baking mania, is knocking at the doors of humans, in order to introduce itself with a plate of full Brownies, less strangely than the greetings of the 1950-er years “welcomes in the neighbourhood, I you somewhat baked. So, and please smile now, if I place a few personal questions to you.”</seg>
<seg id="22">House-made treats to offer is a good way, in order to close friendships.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their co-inhabitants feel obligated to converse and in the end perhaps your face with a delicious surprise will associate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Naturally this depends on whether you are a decent baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Badly mixed lumps from flour, sugar and fat lead to the fact that people place themselves sleeping, if you knock.</seg>
<seg id="26">Food to steal, is a usual crime in student hostels.</seg>
<seg id="27">Is stealing of chicken a theft natural, but is it taking drops a Milchs for your tea also?</seg>
<seg id="28">Examine with the milk owner.</seg>
<seg id="29">The opportunities stand well that they say, to avail itself even if they cook on the inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your things, that is annoying, and you have my sympathy - however you try to punish with it more balanced to deal than my co-inhabitant, who added their milk a detergent, in order thieves.</seg>
<seg id="31">It now is in the prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">They should not make noise, which holds people from the sleep or from the work.</seg>
<seg id="33">It does not only go being therefore, decent humans, but that you belong in the truest sense of the proverb to humans, which sit in the glasshouse.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my corridor asked its neighbours, whether it constitutes them somewhat to place therefore & bass somewhat more quietly because it three o'clock in the morning, and she had an examination in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">They reacted to it with still louder music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, them let their neighbours sleep kindly to still two hours, before she let her own music blare, their door locked and to their three-hour examination went.</seg>
<seg id="37">Wouldn't it be romantic, if your future marriage partner would draw coincidentally into the same student hostel?</seg>
<seg id="38">It would not have turned around, if you regard a co-inhabitant as your future marriage partner, to it makes a pass abysmally embarrassing, again separates and it each day to then see must and perhaps see, how it draws all common friends over to itself?</seg>
<seg id="39">Naturally the heart its own ways - however if a hot co-inhabitant is definitely not your future marriage partner, goes tries you at least to talk your abdomen little reason.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exciting moment, in which you notice that someone its keys in its not locked room has leaves, are the border between a joke and a bullying more finely, than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good caper is hilariously, but it takes only instants, until it becomes the boomerang.</seg>
<seg id="42">Give through to hiding places a valuable and amusing lesson over security - however you never spoil someone rooms with tooth paste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock their door, and you put their keys into a glass of water, which you do not determine then into the freezer - however TAC core you their possessions at the cover any more than twice.</seg>

<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for humans, who do not have much money in the Middle Franconian corner valley.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thus approximately for refugees - in addition, as signal: “Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but likewise the single mother and the low income earners.”</seg>
<seg id="4">“I show, as one also today well to still favorably and build can”, say to the 44-year old in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees become on the housing market urge.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know, how rapidly favorable dwelling can be created: He builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr. Gildner, many refugees become on the housing market urge.</seg>
<seg id="8">Which solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gymnasia does not have sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because humans remain to a large part here.</seg>
<seg id="11">In view of the stream of refugees we need sufficient dwelling also in the next decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A completely banal, three-story terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs at few the place.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">That is different, if one accommodates humans in blocks of flats.</seg>
<seg id="16">Everyone of the six houses, which are built straight in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for in each case four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each housing unit has two bedrooms, a bath, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It can be that many refugees will say, it is again peace, I decreases.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can be converted easily after the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Are the costs how high?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without property.</seg>
<seg id="22">That is visible.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months the building took.</seg>
<seg id="24">That is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Did the construction specifications their plans complicate?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: Building-legally I pulled my project through correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">It always makes the threatening sword of Damocles special's building and the parking bay regulation particularly complicated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Gruesome one.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still subordinated, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three parking bays.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities for it the place is missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the adjacents resident react to their terraced house project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: It gave which, has me accused those to create buildings of luxuries for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">Which is not correct definitely.</seg>
<seg id="35">But you do not intensify the competition around payable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: True is nevertheless: We had a boom of construction activity in Germany in the last five years, but were built luxury dwellings, which hardly one can afford more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, also normal humans needs dwelling.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but likewise the single mother or the low income earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show, how one can build also still today favorably and well.</seg>
<seg id="40">Therefore it goes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Croatia: “We leave the refugees through”</seg>
<seg id="2">“Now the border controls are raised also at our southern borders”, said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.</seg>
<seg id="3">Controls at the Hungarian border remain upright parallel to it.</seg>
<seg id="4">Still it is clear that everyone, which wants to place a request for asylum can make also this “natural”.</seg>
<seg id="5">The supply and security of humans are the center of attention.</seg>
<seg id="6">Is clear in addition, “that it clear signals needs”, said the minister.</seg>
<seg id="7">Humans must know that we do not accept boundless migration stream, also not about the Austrian-Slovenian border.</seg>
<seg id="8">It needs a controlled approach.</seg>
<seg id="9">Croatia considers “passage” - Slovenia refuses</seg>
<seg id="10">The Croatian government had communicated before, also Slovenia wanted arriving refugees toward Austria and Germany further-travels to leave and perhaps also passages for the refugees to establish.</seg>
<seg id="11">This Minister of the Interior did not see Vesna Györkös Znidar completely in such a way in loaf oh however.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea of passages is “absolutely unacceptable”, Slovenia rather the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary - will intensify.</seg>
<seg id="13">The border with Croatia is however already strongly controlled as external border of the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="14">How the minister stressed, Slovene thereby does not want to block its borders for refugees however.</seg>
<seg id="15">“Each EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function”, to stressed Györkös Znidar.</seg>
<seg id="16">As the Croatian government communicated, the first refugees would have already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to enter in east Croatia the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid past in order to evade to the registration.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Croatian police could take up it in the close corn fields.</seg>
<seg id="18">According to local media since then constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik.</seg>
<seg id="19">Among them numerous women and children predominantly concern Syrians and Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="20">Also emergency services and the red cross already are in the use.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the coming days count his country on approximately 4000 refugees, said Ministers of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.</seg>
<seg id="22">Besides buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought so far Migranten to the Hungarian border, were rerouted direction Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday agreeing.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade denied however that it was it, humans instructs to hit certain routes: “Neither we can, nor we want to do this”, it were said.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the media reports in the early a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Sid, in the course of the day further buses was expected anyhow.</seg>
<seg id="25">Over Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The passengers had been the whole night of that approximately 500 kilometers of removed Macedonian border by Serbia on the way.</seg>
<seg id="27">“We heard that Hungary closed, therefore to us the police said that we are to drive”, said to one of the refugees here.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel by Croatia, Slovenia and Austria further to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">Thus it could actually come now to observers shift of the past Balkans route Turkey Greece Macedonia Serbia Hungary already predicted to a somewhat far distance lain west.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: “Comprehensive possibilities for the border control”</seg>
<seg id="31">Of Croatia before Ministers of the Interior Ostojic it had stressed that its country had prepared corresponding plans for the case of a strong inflow of refugees for possible exceptional cases.</seg>
<seg id="32">It did not call details, it referred however on the fact that Croatia had comprehensive possibilities for the border control” as a non--Schengen member “.</seg>
<seg id="33">One would drive through strict controls, around itself qualify for the membership in the Schengen area too.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, which issues EU partners the country since then throughout a good certification, which concerns the standard of the border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On Serbian side further about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads after Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain further completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees want to further-travel now to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to still calm down Wednesday-early with a local inspection in Horgos: It hold the debates over alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is closed now, for prematurely.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not concern very high refugee numbers at present.</seg>
<seg id="41">One cannot say yet whether they would continue their travel over Hungary, Croatia or another country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Aides guess/advise dangerous - alternative routes to Migranten</seg>
<seg id="43">However private Hungarian refugee aides began already to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are drawn in by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless however: In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war yet not vacated mine fields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team was sent by mine circular scrapers in the border area.</seg>

<seg id="8">“It concerns the life, therefore we went with the action in the middle into the city and among humans”, say Josefine Lammer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The chief of the ecumenical hospice assistance stands for the passerbies likewise for questions and discussions for order like the honorary employees.</seg>
<seg id="10">During some a passerby spontaneously to the chalk seizes and the sentence around “my life affirms”, “to read can”, “with the camper by the USA drives”, “the war stops” or “not for a long time suffers” supplemental, stops others briefly, reads, does not say sentences as “is so far I yet” and continues then.</seg>

<seg id="14">Therefore this public-effective action is good to the 20-year old.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fact that everyone does not want to communicate itself on the boards publicly is however understandably, finally concerns it a very personal thing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fedex result mixed, financial prospects for 2016 lowered</seg>
<seg id="2">Fedex reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit view on a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company said also that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year Fedex announced that the enterprise would like to adjust 50,000 seasonal workers for the vacation period.</seg>
<seg id="5">The share fell over 2,5 percent in the Premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said to earn one profit between 10,40 $ and 10.90 $ in the financial year which ends in next May, 20 cent less than with the earlier forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected 10.84 $ according to a survey of FactSet.</seg>
<seg id="8">The smaller prospect comes despite the price increases, those on the average 4.9 percent amounted to and on 4 January becomes effective and despite higher additions for ground transports of heavy and large packages, which are raised starting from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The enterprise said that it expects nevertheless that the result will increase in relation to the previous year due to reduction of costs, higher incomes and because of growth in the online commerce.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the enterprise furnishes “solid yields, if one considers those more weakly than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade,”.</seg>
<seg id="11">The plans for the holidays occupation were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS, which plans, to 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, for instance the same number as in the last year to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, Fedex earned 692 million $, 6 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">The result for each share amounted to 2,42 $ per share, scarcely behind the 2.44 $ per share, which to twelve predicted analysts asked by Zacks investment Research.</seg>
<seg id="14">The revenue rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion $.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts asked by Zacks expected 12.23 billion $.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fedex has to register a decrease in the last years with the international priority shipping, which brought the revenue in its unit to express shipping to stagnating.</seg>
<seg id="17">But boom in online shopping the results at Fedex Ground increased.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter the revenue rose with ground transport by 29 percent, but the operational result was flat in the reason because of higher costs of larger packages and self-insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit registered higher incomes due to higher prices, while the result sank because of higher labor costs in the forwarding trade.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the Premarket trade, about one hour before the opening, the Fedex shares sank around 3,85 $, or 2.5 percent, on 150,15 $.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June.</seg>

<seg id="1">On their to most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week approximately around a 27-Fuß Honduras Mahagoni table sitting, in order to decide, whether it is time, to raise for the first time for nearly one decade the key interest.</seg>
<seg id="2">Threateningly over them at an end of the decorated, two-floor meeting room is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a memory to the fact that the Fed chairmen Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues before all other things is to set the economic interests of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a double order of the congress: Maximization of the US-occupation and prices here keep stable.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the large recession the Fed recognized leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could the X-factor in a decision is, which is too close, in order to predict it. It will be cured on Thursday announced, whether the U.S. economy is ready for launch, by the unprecedented incentive by the close short term interest rate which is because of zero since end of 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most data of the economy show the fact that them grow solidly could make the recent turbulences at the global financial markets the already careful Fed representatives fearful to strengthen this volatility by the rise of the interest for government securities - and is it only around for quarters a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">“Obvious will be the job market and the inflation primarily the most important, which they observe, said” Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin with the brokerage firm Stifel Nico louse & CO.</seg>
<seg id="9">“However I think, if they were in the search for a pretext, for not increasing the interest rate am the increased uncertainty approximately around the global market enough justification, further to wait”, said her.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consent over it, which will do the Fed, what actually the financial market disconcerted.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists, who were asked recently by Bloomberg, to have an increase in interest this week predicted.</seg>
<seg id="12">The financial markets expect however a awaiting of the Fed, with a key indicator, which only an opportunity shows 30% on an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to a decrease of the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the strategists reduce the impact, by promising that a further increase is far distant.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average value jumped around 228,89 points or around 1,4% on 16.599, 85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action by expectations released that the Fed politics maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefökonom with Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise, if the Fed would lift the sentences at this time”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she does it, “she would have to go in her explanation very far, in order to calm down the financial markets, thereby her in panic did not turn out.”</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets down, because it would eliminate the uncertainty over it, when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still one month ago the Fed seemed on good way to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points in this month the first small step in a slow aggravation of the monetary conditions, which the strength of the recovery in the USA would test.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen in spring and in the early summer had said that she expects an increase of the sentence in this year despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the job creation slowed down in August, the improvement on the job market was solid in this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment ratio sank on 5,1% in the past month, the lowest for more than seven years and in the proximity of the level, which the Fed views as full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Increases of wages showed signs of a recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although the inflation constantly ran under the full year target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the principal reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy “can master higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market”, said Ian Shepherdson, executive economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world winced end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May around more than 16% under its highest level, than investors feared that a slowing down of the Chinese economy global growth would throttle.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market recovered in this month something, whereby the Dow is now around nearly 10% under the high from May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed representatives the market turbulences affect the complex calculation, when one is to increase the interest.</seg>
<seg id="30">“If the events on the financial markets and the news over the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have arisen to Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve Bank in the last few weeks, them in this meeting the reins would tighten”, said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman center for.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now it forecasts that she will wait at least one month, in order the effects better into the grasp to get.</seg>
<seg id="32">“There is a quantity uncertainty over it, which the effects will be on the U.S. economy, and there are nearly no reliable data, which describe the developments in China,” said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the world economy is not of the main objectives of the Fed, therefore it should not be included technically during her decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But eventually the Fed became currency authority of the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank was enormous in the last years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The bare reference of the leader at that time Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013 that the Fed “narrows” its monetary expansion could, released confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world, in which markets and national economies are increasingly intertwined with one another, it can be expected by the Fed representatives that they do not only supervise the developments in other place, but itself also with other central banks and experts in an advisory manner, in order to receive a better understanding for the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Leiter of the global strategy for the fortune management of the company Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, Präsident of Federal Reserve bank OF Richmond, VA., noticed this month that “the Fed has a history of over reactions to financial market movements, those with apparently not with the economical fundamental data is linked.”</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, enfranchised member of the federal open Market Committee, de for an increase in interest uses itself, quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower their key interest around 0,75 percentage points in three meetings “despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA” said Lacker.</seg>
<seg id="42">Later the Fed representatives these shortening cancelled one year.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should to be set aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis as for the market collapse 2008 to the first place, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the committee for the interest definition of the bank OF England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turbulences come not into the proximity of this level, said it.</seg>
<seg id="45">“Does not want to come you surely into the situation, in which it has fear of an increase in interest, because the markets excite themselves, said” Posen, Präsident of Peterson Institute for internationally Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">Federal Reserve act contains still the double mandate and does not mention not financial stability, and to which it is changed believes I not that it should precede the time.</seg>

<seg id="3">And it made an exception.</seg>
<seg id="4">The roof may become flatter for solar plant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Planning for the long desired building of gymnasia at the Bernrieder sport area advances step by step: In the youngest session of the district council the prepared building application without large discussions was unanimously blessed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before the committee among other things still another request for a build-legal “exception” respectively “liberation” from the valid development plan had decided.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the “exception” it went around permission for a special form concerning the roof structure.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore a “saddle roof with non-centric roofridge and roof projection” is to be established.</seg>
<seg id="9">Background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants: “By it we get a marvelously large south roof together”, explained mayors Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="10">During the “liberation” it concerned again the roof pitch, which was to be for energetic reasons - differently than prescribed in the development plan - below ten degrees.</seg>
<seg id="11">The volume of the hall is reduced clearly thereby.</seg>
<seg id="12">A “liberation” became necessary, because the development plan does not permit “exceptions” concerning the roof pitch - whereby the Bernrieder local council usually proceeds with petitions for liberation rather restrictively.</seg>
<seg id="13">With the building of gymnasia it concerns however no recurring project: “We create thereby no precedent”, thus Steigenberger.</seg>
<seg id="14">The building of gymnasia at the sports center is a community project of the community and the SV Bernried.</seg>
<seg id="15">At costs are euros taken into account approximately 2.3 million.</seg>
<seg id="16">Subsidies are expected by the school and popular sport promotion.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the next process step the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is submitted now to the district administration office for examination.</seg>

<seg id="2">The situation on the German housing market is strained.</seg>
<seg id="3">Also more and more refugees look for a payable lodging.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pressure on the housing market grows.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social housing construction stands before a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">The resource allocation conflicts on the German housing market began for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the European Union urge more and more humans on a market, which is overloaded in many large cities already.</seg>
<seg id="8">They compete with low-income citizens around the last payable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to cover the demand for payable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built until 2020 each year.</seg>
<seg id="10">To this result a study comes on behalf the federation alliance “social housing construction”.</seg>
<seg id="11">To the comparison: In this year 260,000 units become finished in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus 140,000 apartments are missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Refugees are no longer obligated after the first three months of their stay to live than asylum-seekers in a Erstaufnahmeunterkunft.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many encounter then the housing market and join the long queues before the rented flats.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to Federal Statistical Office lived in the last year however less than half of all asylum seekers to the rent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The negative development of the housing market is not however only because of the rising refugee numbers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study constitutes also substantial omissions in the housing policy of the last years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany moves a housing shortage over before itself, which becomes larger from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Up-to-date already approximately 770,000 housing units were missing, deplore Matthias Günther, Autor of the study in the densely populated areas.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many working persons lived therefore in large cities perforce in WG-rooms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Young adults remained involuntarily longer because of the calm air on the housing market in the “hotel mummy”.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the large cities the number of the square meters per head sank in the past years for the first time again.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to solve the problem, the alliance “social housing construction” suggests a restart.</seg>
<seg id="24">New incentives are to again set the social housing construction in motion.</seg>
<seg id="25">So suspend the real estate tax for promoted apartments could do limited without the tax on real estate transactions and.</seg>
<seg id="26">Besides attractive fiscal depreciation possibilities are necessary according to alliance.</seg>

<seg id="13">“I believe, those find that somehow exciting, am not however in their Kallstadter kind also so deeply impressive”, say Simone Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="14">The native Kallstädterin turned an amusing documentary film over the place and its famous offspring, among which beside Trump also the ketchup family Heinz ranks.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump, which does not admit for modesty is, comes into “Kings OF Kallstadt” (2014) also to word - so with the statement that he would be probably also successful, if he would live in Kallstadt.</seg>
<seg id="16">To the king of the hearts it did not bring it there.</seg>
<seg id="17">Give it to respect for the achievement of the family, in addition, tendentious the opinion that Trump is “already a little a bigmouth”, says spiral.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally read the nickname, which Kallstadt in the area has, “the Brulljesmacher” - to standard German: , it says the showoffs.</seg>
<seg id="19">Trump comes thus from the village of the showoffs.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Trump' success story began 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold graves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Foundation-stone of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy: Their desire to return in the long term to the homeland failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinat belonged at that time.</seg>
<seg id="23">It does not have Trump taken up, because he is knocked off without approval once, the director of the institute for Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, to film release had explained.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandchild of a “illegal emigrant”.</seg>
<seg id="25">That stands in contrast to the every now and then marrowy statements of the descendant.</seg>
<seg id="26">That had repetitive adversely spoken about Mexican immigrants in the USA and the building of a border wall had demanded, in order to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">“As, is not so pleasant that rumbles”, says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant related Trumps (“the granny was a born Trump, the Grandpa was born Heinz”).</seg>
<seg id="28">The winegrower in the retirement sees the American rather reserved, “he is always like that flaring up”.</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he believe that Trump comes times?</seg>
<seg id="30">“I can not present that”, say myself to the 72-year old.</seg>
<seg id="31">“It never worried about Kallstadt”.</seg>
<seg id="32">The pension landlady Veronika Schramm mentions like some Kallstadter that a descendant of the family Heinz donated something with a visit for the church organ, which arrived generally well.</seg>
<seg id="33">“I can not present that from the Donald”, say myself the 68-year old.</seg>
<seg id="34">She would find it better, if he did not win the choice, because “that has such radical opinions, I white not whether that is good”.</seg>
<seg id="35">If those, which had at present its grandfather in the USA a saying, had been like that like he, “it would have there never arrived”.</seg>
<seg id="36">“It gives more interesting topics than it”, says winegrower daughter to Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as a president?</seg>
<seg id="38">“My president is it not”, says her.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: “The clusters become ripe also without president Trump”.</seg>
<seg id="40">Wendels film, for which Trump was for a long time interviewed, to have 12,000 moviegoers seen, also in the USA awakes the interest.</seg>

<seg id="1">For easily overweight diabetics decrease in weight surgery can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The advantages of the decrease in weight surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early, in order to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live after the decrease in weight surgery longer than those, which receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">“The number of deaths data need a long time, in order to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of the decrease in weight surgery, to which a editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">Decrease in weight operations or adiposity surgery, use different methods, in order to make the size smaller of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to take up food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years adiposity operations proved for the treatment of Typ-2-Diabetes as efficient, but most studies were accomplished with humans, who are higher diseased obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a certain measure in weight regarding size, is considered as normally between 18,5 and 24,9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and humans with a BMI over 30 are considered as obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">They can compute your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study the researchers from of Taiwan used min Sheng General hospital data, them since 2007 in a study collected and to compare thereby two kinds of adiposity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - for medical treatments for Typ-2-Diabetes with humans, who were easily overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI under those, which underwent of this operation, was reduced from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile the BMI remained with those, the non-surgical diabetes treatments received approximately directly with 29.</seg>
<seg id="14">Under those, which underwent to a surgical interference, the diabetes illness separated completely and with 28% partly with 36%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medical-treated group partly separated in the comparison to it the diabetes completely only with a percent and with only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Beyond that the results were generally better with controls of the blood pressure, the Triglyceride and “bad” LDL cholesterol “in the 'surgical' group”, found the authors out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers supervised also the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of the time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is held best under 7 percent, writes the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation average hemoglobin A1c level of approximately 9 percent sank on approximately 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group it remained however stable with approximately 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better “glykämische control” - how in improved hemoglobin A1c level reflects itself you - the number of deaths did not reduce Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and its colleagues in five years, so the leading researcher.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team compared also average results with the two kinds of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year the bypass surgery group had lost reached larger decreases in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) compared with the gastrectomy group more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), and registered rather a complete overcoming the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study does not show a survival advantage of the surgery after five years, it gives references from a study of heavier humans in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University OF Arizona, college OF Medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study it was with obese humans, who underwent of a adiposity operation, about 29 percent in the course of 15 years to less probably die - compared with a group, which tried more conventional methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study did not show an advantage for surviving with the surgery patients, Blackstone, said was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35, which is interested in the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="27">“That is the critical point of this study, because she says the fact that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group”, without increased risk of death or, said it to a kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that humans and their physicians should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with its BMI lies between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">“I think that we wait too long, until we bring humans to it this seriously to take”, told them.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that as soon as they accumulated these genetic changes, which connected their bodies firmly with obesity and diabetes, are a reversal really heavily.”</seg>

<seg id="2">Poison control centres in the USA report on a nearly 400-percent increase of the number of the children under twelve years, which swallow strongly alcoholic hand disinfectants, so Georgia Poison center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia Poison center, the cases of incomes of hand disinfectants rose with children under 12 years, which to poison control centres report, of 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">“Children come ever more frequently to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them lands goes in provisional accommodation”, said Lopez CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that some children drink disinfectants intentionally, during some it does, over their friends to impress or because of a test of courage with the social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show, how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Youth mixed allegedly disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash, in order to receive a harder beverage.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be attracted by attractive smells of the disinfectants.</seg>
<seg id="9">“A child does not think that this is bad for it”, said Lopez.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are those, which are perfumed.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectants with Erdbeer, grape and orange smell, which are responding for children much.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particularly with infants few splashes can lead to the alcoholic poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">“It is most concentrated alcohol”, told Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency call center in the hospital of the university of Kansas, the transmitter Fox 4 in Kansa town center.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus, you would not let a sip whisky stand around, but these hand disinfectants in range of children leave to humans, and if children come to it, then it is a fast possibility of consuming much alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year girl, who had at school taken recently four splashes of hand disinfectant smelling after strawberry, was brought into a provisional accommodation to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice more highly as the threshold, which is valid with an adult legally than drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, a provisional accommodation physician, who treated it in the Gwinnett Medical center outside from Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lallte their words and was not in the situation to be gone, when she arrived in provisional accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Physicians supervised it over night in a separate children's hospital on signs of cerebral trauma, since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head, said Ritchey.</seg>
<seg id="20">“That was much frightening”, said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could have been deadly for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside of the range of the child.</seg>
<seg id="23">Beyond alcoholic poisoning some disinfectants were connected with deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the year 2013 two women in Ontario died women after swallowing hand disinfectants, which contained a toxic, not defined ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employees of health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was noted as active substance.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January three pupils of the fourth class in the state planned New York to poison their “common” teacher by laying antibacterial products out approximately around the classroom”, then it announces a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is high-grade allergically against hand disinfectants and banished her from her area.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police regarded the defeated plan as “twaddle” and referred disciplinary measures to the school administrative board.</seg>

<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary will sit, if Richard Glossip is executed by the lethal injection.</seg>

<seg id="10">It is correct the fact that journalists may see executions in the USA and there more applications than places is often available, takes place a makabere lottery, in order to decide, who is selected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma reduced the number of medium places of 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who is selected, which will emotionless observe it.</seg>

<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, therefore it me will be not permitted to carry a note book and a pin forward over to note, what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I must try simply to remind me to all details.</seg>

<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner, how it wants it, and you receive entrance.</seg>

<seg id="23">It granted that she could have better formulated “it”, but it thinks still that it is wrong, which I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problem with some the things, which I had said and had written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He does not tell me, what I have to write, and I it would not do, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me at any time from his list of the witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it wants that an international reporter is present, in order to write there.</seg>
<seg id="28">If it dies, he thinks that the public work will help the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bell commodity, a reporter the hoof catching tone post office, will sit beside me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, hear please the series of Podcasts, which I made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I do not want to die here all details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with security that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">Its actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make it guilty, a favouring of the act would be.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that a strong probability exists that it is not guilty of the murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I believe reliably that there are not sufficient proofs, in order to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that its execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective I will see it dying.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot state to be really objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">It will give other reporters, whom you can contact for it.</seg>

<seg id="14">“Eighteen months ago sat Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in an area with a man - whom I will designate, if I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables, around information about what I do within my stables, to supply”, said Moody on Racing.com.</seg>
<seg id="15">They obviously believe that I am a cheat.</seg>
<seg id="16">If that is the case, they should surely seize themselves to their noses, because them with the attempt to seize me to have failed.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, ehem. chairmen of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were conscious itself of its at the time and are it still today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should that bring me to the opinion that it becomes personal?</seg>
<seg id="19">Did the RVL hold back and does make themselves cowardly perhaps people outside responsible for from coaches which proceeds in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps the people think there outside that I am it.</seg>
<seg id="23">Perhaps they must to me my license take and me offend, and I do not have a doubt that what I say lets her think now about it.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I arrived now at the point, at which that is all the same to me, and which makes me sadly.</seg>
<seg id="25">That makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will exert the pressure on it and her urge to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">The frustration levels of the coach developed themselves with the long persisting cobalt investigation with Lidari, and it led the Late Scratching to the fact that he said that he could throw “its license over the table.”</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best admits by its preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, designated the running tag treatment rule “ridiculously”, after a packing mud or tone had been laid on on the horse legs, what against the rules offended.</seg>
<seg id="30">“It is against the rules of racing.</seg>
<seg id="31">I must take for it the full responsibility”, said he.</seg>
<seg id="32">“One of my employees has erroneous-proves mud on the leg laid on.</seg>
<seg id="33">It could have like that been last night.</seg>
<seg id="34">It could have like that been yesterday all day long, which also like that was.</seg>
<seg id="35">It had it in addition, so on the running day.</seg>
<seg id="36">Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the packing on the running day. An investigation of this affair was opened.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is a joke.</seg>
<seg id="38">Humans, who set up these rules, do not know anything about the horse.</seg>
<seg id="39">“We all see that we need rules, but one too far went here”, said Moody.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals because of statements to wrestling</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism to TAC-sounds its player as “agenda Setting” from two Prime Minister League favorite of the NRL designated.</seg>
<seg id="3">It said Sydney Roosters's coach Trent Robinson that the arbitrators permitted “wrestling” to the Storm players with his team during the high Storm victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly veiled note the Storm team, after its crew had obtained the final victory against North Queen country cowboy on Saturday evening. It called the play a “example” the rugby League and said that the two from Queen country were not “too good” in the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of its crew and said that her with TAC-sound only on her “contact” were concentrated.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two confidently tunes leading coaches at his crew him, since it means that they worried, by the Storm team to be struck.</seg>
<seg id="7">“Always it dips - I do not have heard that Trent Robinson spoke about wrestling, as it us 24:2 struck”, said Bellamy on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we did not change generally speaking year anything in our defensive system or the techniques. But in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tackles a real emphasis, and that furnished the change of trend for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is now for three years there, and he has to train obviously a great crew. It is probably not accustomed to it from there to lose, then it was a little a shock for it.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is already funny, as this emerges again and again in this season.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy attacked Bennetts idea of the “exciting football” and reminded its mentor of the fact that Bennetts St George Illawarra of dragee ONS won the Prime Minister League in the year 2010 with “boring” football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">It compared its play on Saturday evening with ours on Friday evening and was as exciting their play”, said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in the year 2010 St George were criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he will worry a shitting dirt about it.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now it has a team, which can play and which we as excitingly to view, in particular its young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That is the ball play, which one would like to play, if one has this kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">It made this statement in the year 2010, now wants it that all played its kind of football - not each team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like these.</seg>
<seg id="18">I develop stronger confidence, because they say these things, because they are a little anxious to have to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they did not think probably of us, when it concerned the Big Games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy pointed out also that the play Storm obtained a higher result against Roosters than the play Broncos against cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The play of the Broncos was probably a good play, I it yet did not view, but which was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our play was 20:18, it gave two further attempts in our play, but is that an exciting play?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or are breaks make and no points something tension?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me there is the programmes.</seg>
<seg id="25">If they mention us, it means that we will meet in a phase still it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has a holiday to receive North Queen country cowboy or the Cronulla Sharks on next Saturday evening in the Vorfinale in the AAMI park on this weekend, since they won the right, either. The ticket sale begins at next Tuesday mornings.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Federal Constitutional Court gave Tegel quite, which was accommodated for months in a too small cell to a ex-prisoner of the penal institution.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of the injury of their human dignity prisoners have in principle requirement on financial compensation, if they are accommodated in too small cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">That decided the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday published resolution.</seg>
<seg id="5">The concerning can hope according to the judges even for money if they only few days were locked up in to close areas (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).</seg>
<seg id="6">Thus a ex-prisoner was successful with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: It was accommodated in the penal institution Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space; the toilet was spatially not separated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Afterwards the man, who is according to its lawyer meanwhile free foot, had been moved into a larger cell.</seg>
<seg id="8">Its official liability complaint because of the unworthy prison conditions against Land Berlin failed.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the constitutional court judges waived the judgement of the Court of Appeal Berlin and rejected the case for renewed examination there.</seg>
<seg id="10">They see the human dignity of the man injured.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the refugee politics: “We create”</seg>
<seg id="2">The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - which is a Federal Chancellor decided to accept her.</seg>
<seg id="3">What comes to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Approximately 800,000 asylum seekers will come to prognoses of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year to Germany, to statement of vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) are Germany even in the layer, one million refugees to be taken up.</seg>
<seg id="5">Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination: “I say again and again: We can create that, and we create”.</seg>
<seg id="6">Which comes to Germany, mediate the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Are used after different prognoses between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Department of Construction) and 400000 (estimation the Pestel institute) apartments annually - the next five years long.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is nearly twice as much, as before is built (250000 apartments).</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatic the lack of dwelling is however particularly with payable renting objects: Falls out annually 60000 to 80000 subsidized low-rent housings of rent control, and around these particularly favorable apartments also refugees will apply.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Secretary of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to therefore double the promotion, from at present 518 million on a billion euro.</seg>
<seg id="11">Much too little is from view of the Pestel institute: 80,000 subsidized low-rent housings annually would have to develop and but would have the federation a promotion at a value of 6.4 billion per year to invest.</seg>
<seg id="12">United itself scientists and Federal Secretary of Construction are in the fact that it must give in addition more tax benefits for investments to housebuilding.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimations of the institute for job market and occupation research is to be assumed on a long-term basis 55 percent of the fleeing in Germany can be gainfully employed.</seg>
<seg id="14">However the refugees in Germany were not asked at all systematically for their qualification, in order to help them with the entrance, criticize Claudia Walter, Projektmanagerin for integration and education in the Bertelsmann foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees it is however crucial whether they find in Germany work.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the admission company, in addition, for the self-esteem of the immigrants, migration researcher says Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany it gave a political turn according to Thränhardt: of the work prohibition for refugees for the acknowledgment of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was in former times a work prohibition for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced in November 2014 to three months, just as the residence obligation, which limits asylum seekers to a residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the society - also because of the lack of specialist - by the majority the aspect became generally accepted that faster the entrance to the job market should be made possible for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="20">A large hurdle for the entrance to the job market are missing German knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far there is still no sufficient offer at general and occupational language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition investigations show that jobs are obtained most frequently by personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The structure of networks is therefore in opinion of Thränhardt Königsweg for work integration.</seg>
<seg id="24">It determined the citizens of Berlin school administration that only few fled parents give their children to the day-care centers, roughly ten to 15 percent: “For uprooted parents it is for a start completely important to hold the family together”, says Ilja Koschembar, Sprecher for youth and family in the citizens of Berlin senate administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">In order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the day-care center, the administration distributes handbills in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">If the need of educators should rise by the large number at refugees strongly, the citizen of Berlin senate would try to increase the training capacities - about, by permitting more technical schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries pupils without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for instruction.</seg>
<seg id="28">They are informed however not always by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by instructors, who have only one qualification into German as second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">At them no lack exists, says Beate Stoffers of the citizens of Berlin school administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German student council estimates that in Germany want to study about 20 percent of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle no Federal state asylum seekers forbids or waited the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, Senator of the Interiors Frank Henkel (CDU) its attitude now however gave up.</seg>
<seg id="32">The entrance to the university could be facilitated for study-willing refugees.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because refugees with a residence permission or a tolerance get no more achievements after the asylum seeker achievement law, if they begin a study.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latters get in principle no student financial assistance scheme, since they do not fall under the circle of student financial assistance scheme-entitled people.</seg>
<seg id="35">Waited refugees must have lived so far four years in Germany, in order to be student financial assistance scheme entitled, from 1 January 2016 on shorten this span on 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">Also this financing gap must be closed however, demands Steffen Krach, of Berlin Secretary of State for science, and the German student council.</seg>
<seg id="37">The studying should get student financial assistance scheme immediately.</seg>
<seg id="38">The Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many the religion is an important component of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should grant gradually the same rights as it the churches to have, and which existing state church right further to a new state religion relationship develop to the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="40">Important would be also the establishment of an Islamic welfare organisation, which worries professionally about the newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="41">To the rights also obligations belong.</seg>
<seg id="42">So must agree the representatives the Islam on clear contacts and be ready to co-operate and to it certain controllability grant with the state in many ranges.</seg>
<seg id="43">In addition also the readiness belongs to proceed courageously against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern, religious conflicts on Thursday could also to Germany be carried in.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those, which wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany, “are immediately their right to stay here in Germany, incurred the loss”, said it in the Bavarian broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="46">It suggested translating the Basic Law on Arab.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will be in the future much more still than today a topic of the whole society.</seg>
<seg id="48">Thus also the majority society will have themselves to change, becomes the dismantling of discrimination and racism urgent.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has - as result of European decisions - since a scarce decade an anti-discrimination place and a general Equality Act.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series of murders showed, in which police and authorities the racist motive systematically ignored.</seg>
<seg id="51">Resemble opportunities for all: Which migrant organizations demand and the groups of interests of not-white Germans for a long time and to which international agreements like the anti-racism convention to Germany commit, reality must become in the next years, if the country to remain peaceful and its new citizens and citizen its possibilities to use be supposed - for the well-being of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">Generally Germany is capable of supplying the refugees expected so far medically means physician president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">“Which concerns one power and capacities, creates we”, said it Tagesspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="54">However for it extra money must flow into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands, to hand all Ankömmlingen out equal with the registration health cards.</seg>
<seg id="56">Furnished achievements could be accounted for later with the Federal states.</seg>
<seg id="57">And it is most doubtful on a long-term basis to fob off so many humans with the limited service catalog which the asylum seeker achievement law plans.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise above all the language barriers make for the physicians to create.</seg>
<seg id="59">Already so far, then the citizens of Berlin health female scientist Thea Borde proved, Migranten more badly over their diseases were cleared up than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Only in hospitals, also in medical practices interpreter costs would not have to be taken over, demand them.</seg>
<seg id="61">Would be helped many refugees in addition, already with more general-medical refuges in the emergency outpatient clinics.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic view.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children about give it clearly more untreated handicaps, and with the young people go it around HIV clearing-up.</seg>
<seg id="64">With the partial other symptoms German physicians from their training would cope however, mean Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">“Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize”. And which concerns the lack of physician, possibly even alleviation is in view by the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians would have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even physicians.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be allowed, would have they however their qualification practice to prove and possibly again to examinations placings.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving at Germany is according to estimations of the federal psychotherapist chamber (BPtK) psychologically suffer: Most suffer from a post office-traumatic load disturbance or from depressions.</seg>
<seg id="69">Particularly vulnerable is refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, Präsident of the BPtK.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recently published study DO Munich proven that each fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized at Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Who is gotten sick with a post office-traumatic load disturbance, suffers among other things from so-called flashbacks with difficulty in breathing, fraud, tachycardia and fears of death.</seg>
<seg id="72">Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances, strong unpleasantness and emotional deafness.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent that the symptoms became chronic, it is necessary an early treatment, explained Munz.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far received however only four percent that psychologically refugees a psychotherapy suffer.</seg>
<seg id="75">Psychologically ill asylum-seekers in the welfare agencies can place a request for a psychotherapy, but last the treatment usually several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">Besides specialists or physicians, who are not trained for the psychological illnesses, became mostly decide in the welfare agencies whether a therapy was necessary or not.</seg>
<seg id="77">This leads frequently to false estimates, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="34">The two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing passed.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues before the play must stand against direct current generator Zagreb behind injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed opposite Wilshere that it was only September and if its rehablitation runs after plan it no reason gives, why he can play not before Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario means already that Wilshere will miss the next four plays for England surely at least and in view of its history is its participation in the next summer at the European championship surely still uncertainly.</seg>
<seg id="4">The large dishonor for this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly terminated the last season after a separate ankle injury and then again to its old momentum during the preseason had found the way back.</seg>
<seg id="5">“This kind threatened by injury the career”, did not say Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone, which did not heal well.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is not a larger affair.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was only one accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not located in connection with its ankles or with the injuries, which it had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from purely medical view, but like Wenger, gives it also recognized the associated danger of further injuries, every time a player tries to return in the middle in the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">Also an unpleasant sample develops.</seg>
<seg id="12">The investigation of Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. registers 23 different illnesses of Wilshere since its debut before six years.</seg>
<seg id="13">It played also in only 65 of arsenal 157 league plays in the last five play times.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for arsenal is that they were in six of eight play times since 2007/08 one of the two Prime Minister League clubs, which have to register most injury days.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement will persist with the injury ratio during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">“Sometimes, if you return from an injury, have a susceptible period, a time, in which you must strengthen your body and win combat capability”, said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough, in order to overcome.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope, its body stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the kind, which he earns.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its championsleague season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the plays against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on coming Wednesday, and Wenger stops itself a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta might start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can begin also with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">“I try to hold and the players, who need it, a small breather grant the balance”, said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although arsenal clear favorites are to get ahead by group of F the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Direct current generator is also unbeaten after 41 plays, after “invincibly” the campaign was started in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was shaken Tuesday evening by an earthquake, whereby on the judge scale 3.2 were measured.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year was it 10. in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger is the opinion the fact that arsenal drew the teachings from the past season with the championsleague surrender against Monaco and remains of far hope floated to lead with its management the club to its first European Cup Triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">“This drive is immense”, said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It did not fold with arsenal ever.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in the year 2006 to it, but on the other side I am for a long time enough in the business, in order to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: the Comedy show, which gives us serious lessons over man friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar representations in shows is obviously, particularly with this in view, as the need for men to open than ever before became now still more desperate, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high prove.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the year 2013 it was the most important cause of death with men in the age from 20 to 45 in Great Britain, and it remains three times more frequently with men than with women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the effort to concern the problem the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, to question with whom a goal, the culture, which prevents men to look for assistance if they need these.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is the heart in the fight, in order to master this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A current study with more than 2,000 High School pupils with depressive symptoms stated that, if the suffering had a sufficient high percentage at friends with “healthy tendency” its opportunities doubled themselves on recovery.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those, which are not depressive, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But naturally one must have for a start friends, so that a friendship can function.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age across social media directed of communication, with their emphasis on style across substance the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have the necessity, strongly, to appear gaily and successfully doubled, even if in reality the isolation dominates.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated of, which psychologists extrinsische values call; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our internal longing after personal development and friendship, which affect our mental health many more deeply.</seg>
<seg id="12">And like a video game inventor and a billionaire recently explained, money cannot buy luck really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beautiful with Friends was that this focusing was placed on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character did not become by its work, but defines by its personality, that shone by the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent embraces, moments when football looking in cosy armchairs and the longing from steed to Rachel - all it came from the knowledge that men can refer to in any case even if they often hold back themselves to explore completely their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the crisis hotline it me explained: … “my listener role for humans, who are depressive to feel and potentially suicidal, really clearly showed me, as even the smallest interactions of friends a difference to make can.”</seg>
<seg id="17">The men, who contact us, often do not feel in the situation to speak with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old idiom “I come thereby by right” has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is noticed as weakness, if one speaks about problems openly.”</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows, which me strikes, if I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It presents completely clearly the small moments of man friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">So much my objective outsider status over the telephone humans in instants of the despair to also help likes, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, if you arranged on this weekend Comedy cent ral FriendsFest with backdrop in honor of the day completely new visit, why you do not carry then your friends forward to a drink in the cent ral Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, still better, if you see sitting around into of Starbucks someone alone, give him a smile and say you to hello.</seg>

<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria meets with its debut in the champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by at Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the play report and the reaction to the play.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course, when Paris Saint Germain started its champions League season with extremely comfortable 2-0 a victory against Malmö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria met less as four minutes after the start of its champion League debut than PSG player, who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards missed it a set of opportunities, before they increased finally their lead, than Cavani in the 61. Minute a headed goal obtained.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the group of A needs of Paris a strong start against the Swedish master, there it not only the qualification for the K.O. - Rounds aim at, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in everyone of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class play opportunities before the gate, missed by Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics. It was replaced later in the play against its hometown team and against the club, with which he already began his illustrious career in the year 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">“It is not simple to win at home or outward in the champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause for our opponents of problems and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things, which we must still perfect in the course of the season”, said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">“That is a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and have we won, although I regret it that we still did not obtain or two further gates.”</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned to its injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend a 2:2 standoff could hold on own place against Bordeaux in first division, but it was outdone in the fourth minute by Di Maria.</seg>
<seg id="13">Argentine wing striker the man it was called who can carry PSG forward on the next stage in Europe, when he was transferred in the last month of Manchester United, and he suggested, why, when he ran in Marco Verrattis's passport behind the Malmö defense, before he locked beautifully past at Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">If however someone believed that PSG would obtain a large victory, that was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, which struck Celtic in a play-off, in order to reach this stage, began with Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was deeply in the centre zone lined up with a five-man defense and two a heavy opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But except a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, that far at Kevin Trapps's posts in the 34. Minute passed, offered it little in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sometimes instead PSG gave itself up, with some bad passes and bad conclusions, not least from Ibrahimovic, which blundered with not less than five attempts alone in the first half and was given up then, after Cavani had used him after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless it proved much more fate, if he brought his fellow players in the play, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria transformed into a turning shot, which of Wiland in the 52. Minute at the post was by-steered…</seg>
<seg id="19">The second gate fell finally shortly after the hourly brand owing to Cavani. The Uruguayer obtained thereby its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had up-fished a left flank of Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">The terminated all thought to the fact that Malmö can return to the play, and only a outstanding intervention of Wiland from shortest distance, in order to stop David Luiz could the final result low keep, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi a gate was in the end denied.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, admitted later that PSG played a class over its team, and the Norwegian said: “Our the latter championsleague play was in December in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then we played only in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualification plays are not sufficient.”</seg>
<seg id="24">Hat off before Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great play of them!</seg>

<seg id="4">At the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not with the Otmar alto Bible, which appeared now with magnificent pictures.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated its completely personal interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives.</seg>
<seg id="7">Its “language” with multicolored colors and fantasyful forms received to the 75-year old - which however is not by any means equivalent with “hilarious” pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary: The respective topics adapted, that can work quite quite darkly.</seg>
<seg id="9">Approximately three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met an subjective-artistic selection from the many subjects area of the “book of all books”.</seg>
<seg id="10">Developed cycles, which dedicate themselves to topics such as crossroad, troubles, requirements or Lord's Prayers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus it fascinated spontaneously directly several partners: That is valid for the Luther publishing house with its theological adjustment just like for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there above all the author is Klaus Altepost, who argued on basis of the painting with the respective Bible places.</seg>
<seg id="13">It interpreted and in such a way into today, into current connections “translated” the Bible places selected by Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirrors of alto painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">Embedded they are between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and in each case a set of the artist, who formulates its completely personal thoughts on the respective situation here.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewelry cover has golden type characters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus the 75-year old permits equivalent doubly a deep insight of its soul, its emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is a high degree at intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were in the long run at all triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode born and in Berlin grown up, comes from a family, which belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter medal.</seg>
<seg id="20">“There the education happened already with cane”, remembers Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="21">“I tried to regenerate around me perhaps also again with the Mr. Vater to stand”.</seg>
<seg id="22">Its second request is to help the art in fast moving time again to more value: “The perception of picture worlds is today coined of advertisement, and those is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is displaced there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have another desire and Wonne to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">“In this regard I am a dinosaur”.</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt would like to let it affect that the viewers “fall themselves” into the pictures leave, itself, discovers and to feel, which strength her to have: “The picture looks for itself its opposite”.</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday with the presentation of the Otmar alto Bible in the Otmar alto foundation, “always” a lover of Otmar Alts's art to have been: “I like, like he with its pictures lives understand”.</seg>
<seg id="29">Old not paid attention to seize the Bible completely but selected, the also mysterious topics important for it.</seg>
<seg id="30">“That was not co-operation on eye level”, says old person post office: “Here it concerns the pictures, the text described only”. Developed a picture Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to deepen “its life and find freedom”.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts's pictures (Biblical) the language of the love and those speak the responsibility for Möhler both.</seg>
<seg id="33">A part that originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition, which is opened on 15 November in the Otmar alto foundation.</seg>

<seg id="12">The German football federation expanded therefore its refugee initiative “1:0 for a welcome” by four years.</seg>
<seg id="13">“Over the Egidius brown foundation we guaranteed that this program keeps running until 2019”, explained Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also some German Bundesliga clubs support this program.</seg>
<seg id="15">Already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs set a clear indication, if they help on the left tricot sleeve instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes) the print “we - #refugeeswelcome” will carry.</seg>

<seg id="17">“The refugee drama concerns everyone, none may look away.”</seg>
<seg id="18">“We members of the soccer federal league can use, no, we must our charisma, our influence and our possibilities, around the many refugees, who suffered already so unbelievably, of helping”, said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.</seg>
<seg id="19">Hoping home managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent indication of the league”.</seg>
<seg id="20">To the European championship-Qualifikationsspiel against Hungary on this Friday the national team of the women loads 100 refugees to hall/Saale.</seg>
<seg id="21">Niersbach called the support of refugees “a large joint work German football”.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact that all 36 license clubs would have started own projects in their places was great.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are there active.</seg>
<seg id="24">The message “1:0 for a welcome”, which we spent, is lived in the football.</seg>
<seg id="25">“That is of enormous importance”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="26">In this and the next year the federation makes in each case 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government.</seg>
<seg id="27">“The clubs already called the whole sum up for 2015”, reported Niersbach.</seg>

<seg id="2">With Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus smashed themselves in the first group play Europe League finally.</seg>

<seg id="4">“We can not fall back to him unfortunately”, said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether Reus will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga Topspiel against Leverkusen again thereby, the BVB coach left open: “We count on a return of him to training on Friday”.</seg>
<seg id="6">In view of the high load of its professionals Tuchel will not only change its master eleven on the Reus position.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany is to be after the will of the Federal Government with the change of the car of technological outriders.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Federal Cabinet decided a strategy document from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) on Wednesday, who plans among other things investments into the development of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the car fair IAA of a “new mobility age”.</seg>
<seg id="5">Automated and interlaced driving will increase the road safety and for less back-up provide, said Dobrindt.</seg>
<seg id="6">He wants to discuss the topic also with his colleagues from the G7-Staaten, which meets on the IAA also with representatives the industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The strategy document of the Ministry of Transport stresses among other things the meaning of the mobile broadband development and a brisk Umstiegs on digital sound broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the testing of new technology at present a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria develops.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thus the driver “to be put on”, the Federal Government the legal basic conditions does not want to examine additional liability risks “and, where necessary, to which new developments adapt”.</seg>
<seg id="10">So Germany wants to use itself about internationally for the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars is raised of 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government wants to support in addition a change of the vienna convention, which plans so far only humans as a driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">During automated driving increasingly the car takes over the guidance, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based particularly on sensors and cameras, which seize the environment and which data process within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs high-automated driving on motorways until 2020 will be technically possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless vehicles without driver on public roads are “only far after 2020 to expect”.</seg>
<seg id="16">The authors of the study estimate the creation of value within the range of the Fahrerassistenzsysteme and the high-automated driving functions at Germany for 2025 on approximately 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">“The digital networking of the car can lead to more security and efficiency in the traffic”, said the SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question of the liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified however.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still the Germans see self-propelled cars however sceptically - to much more than Frenchmen or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">On Wednesday on the AA submitted survey of the Forsa institute on behalf the test organization Dekra it comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will become generally accepted in the coming ten years, to 32 percent count only in 20 years thereby, 31 percent believe not at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France count 21 percent of the asked ones until 2025 on autonomously driving cars, in the USA 33 percent.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">After a collection of the digital federation Bitkom only seven percent would agree to deliver control during the entire trip on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the motorway could in flowing traffic nevertheless the 15 percent imagine, in the back-up 45 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Well each fourth was left to the car control under no circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels old for a Enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture from completely large fashion show and a waxwork Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich over his work.</seg>
<seg id="3">The high points: Shop window dolls, which look alarmingly human owing to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became among other things with of Madonna's stage outfit to the large star the fashion scene - and thus that he put men into skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">“I cannot say today no more that I am the Enfant terrible of the haute couture, because I have white hair.”</seg>
<seg id="6">“Early one was it bleached, in the meantime is genuine it”, said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the visitors of the exhibition “From The SID-mill tons of The Catwalk” (of the sidewalk on the gangway), which from 18 September on in the arts center of the Hypo Kulturstiftung to be seen is, is it a luck that the fashion creator changed its at the beginning of rejecting attitude to an exhibition over his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually it against it was, because: “For me an exhibition sounded a little after death”, said it.</seg>
<seg id="9">If one dies, one comes into the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressing collection had before already made in the Canadian Montreal and in of Paris station.</seg>
<seg id="11">“All the much more than only beautiful dresses” go, said the director of the arts center, Roger Diederen.</seg>
<seg id="12">The vision of an open society goes around tolerance, acceptance and.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an idea of that work of the man hardly still which can be grasped, who wrote fashion history, without training to have ever completed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically the exhibition is not developed, but it is outstanding choreographed a synthesis of the arts, for which much expenditure was operated: In order to comb the dolls, for example particularly a Stylist was engaged.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons material carted the doers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the start of the Octoberfest still another special participated treat: a leather trousers outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was always interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and for humans, who a little different are, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Also Gaultiers old teddy is to be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It stands for the first, timid fashionable going attempts of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (it was not bad a good pupil and in the football) it tightened, said its teddy BHs and dresses Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="22">With a doll to play, its parents would not have permitted him.</seg>
<seg id="23">He taught himself sketching fashion later then.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and viewed themselves the drafts of other designers, how Gaultier in Munich told.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later I then however naturally bought.</seg>
<seg id="26">For its first own fashion show it could not pay the models.</seg>
<seg id="27">They got nothing, were allowed however the gears to keep.</seg>

<seg id="2">In former times it concerned to make meters at the long embroidery machines into and over to Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered materials and points developed in large quantity for customers, who processed them for example to covers and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alone functioned today the no more, does not explain Andreas Reinhardt, Geschäftsführer of the fashion point Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead the fashion is again important.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the start times of the Plauener point fashion played a larger role, then by the home textile industry displaced - and now than niche is rediscovered.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt calls some examples: Point in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and with regional traditional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At all form the so-called Vintage fashion, which follows past style epochs, an increasing order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Who does not serve niches in the textile trade in Germany, no more is not at the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us they already constitute half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion point Plauen is together with nine further enterprises member in the branch federation Plauener point and embroideries.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they may carry the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years are approximately 80 percent of the revenue broken off.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private specialist shops and also the wholesale are not there nearly any longer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customer in this way hardly still.</seg>
<seg id="16">The mass-produced goods are many more cheaply manufactured nowadays in the Asian area and driven out almost exclusively over chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition slack off the export, up-to-date to Russia and into the USA.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sufficient reasons thus for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The branch federation tries to score also by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the stick bead in Falkenstein explains: “For this year we lead a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and social action compatibly”.</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt supplements: “Refers also to the used materials”.</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch office of the westSaxon university Zwickau - at the faculty for applied art - and is specialized in embroideries and points.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to oppose to the competition from the Asian area something, one must find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">That needs time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">Develops an area of conflict between the freshest ideas of the designers and the enterprises, which must think above all economically”, say Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore an existing design often only slightly one vary, in order to hold a customer master.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some years ago textile designer Kati Reuter encouraged the historical snowball point again.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine in some places small balls stickt.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener goldsmith champion Bianca Hallebach-Krauße let itself inspire of it: “Before I could not begin anything with traditional Plauener point”.</seg>
<seg id="29">Now it uses the snowball point for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a complex procedure it coins the sample in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">“Many humans of the region identify themselves with the topic Plauener point - young and old”, Reuter says.</seg>
<seg id="32">It supplies also to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - particularly at customers, whose ancestor in Plauen and environment lived and which would like a piece of memory.</seg>
<seg id="33">With it I see jewelry meaning as a modern Ambassador of the Plauener point.</seg>

<seg id="5">Large robbery fish are however already today so strongly burdening with mercury that on basis of the still valid limits about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.</seg>
<seg id="6">After duplication of the limits then only 14.5 percent would be unsalable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In response for this loosening the European Union wants to intensify the limits according to Foodwatch with other fish from at present 0.5 milligrams on 0,1 milligrams mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Foodwatch called this however “trick”, because smaller Friedfi is usually so low burdening, as for instance carps that they keep the planned maximum values already today.</seg>
<seg id="9">The sinking with small fish is therefore “a perfidious diverting manoeuvre, which helps alone the economy”, explained Wolfschmidt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a heavy metal high-poisonous for humans, which enriches itself over the food chain particularly in robbery fish strongly.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government warns therefore of the fact that “already small quantities can particularly cause with unborn damages of the nervous system”.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage regarding the valid maximum values however that a “health endangerment of the population of general” is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury arrives particularly by coal combustion into the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German coal-fired power stations discharge than six tons mercury according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Represenative of the Green Party in the parliament Annalena Baerbock more in the year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish for instance in Elbe, Rhine and Danube is “permanently and surface covering exceeded”, the “mirror” in March of the paper had quoted.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year European-wide warnings of mercury in fish already ranked among the most frequent announced health risks in the European Union-warning system RASFF.</seg>
