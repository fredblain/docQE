<seg id="1">In an emergency, a professor admits to have shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency, Professor Shannon lamb with a slightly tremulous voice told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb, it was important to stress that his "sweet dog" but still live and probably was excited, and he said that the families of the dead woman could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scribbled on a white block was: "To me, it does so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that lamb that taught online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, two had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he has a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, according to the police shot and killed at the door to his office.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University police chief Lynn Wednesday said that university staff heard the shooting at 10: 18 pm.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that lamb has made the fatal emergency sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">By the end of the day, there was another death: Einkesselte lamb life, as the police took him.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shootings at the university, the students and staff forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still are trying to get a picture of it, what motivated lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as the students and staff who knew him, Burmese, helped to paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they were on his teaching.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that he had no history of violence or a criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had lamb mentioned in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "beautiful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the department of social sciences and history, which includes 17 faculty members, and many students attended classes from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there have been some inclinations to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon Beavers, praised the lamb said he seemed a little too excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."</seg>
<seg id="17">Mikel Sykes, another student, said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 / 15.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">This year, he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in the university's employment policies meant that the promotion for the lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course, there was something in Mr lambs idea."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.</seg>
<seg id="23">After the escape from the campus police later found lambs track, when he returned to Mississippi arriving from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested, killed lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County coroner Methel Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb grew up in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began his work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.</seg>
<seg id="29">He holds a PhD in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the lambs of longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who a few years tried to teach her the guitar playing.</seg>
<seg id="33">At that time, it was the women flock.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted away, if he was, "said Hairston, now 40 and living in the suburb of Brandon Jackson.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency, lamb said "I have killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that the dog was in order.</seg>
<seg id="39">The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O Steen, said that she had been divorced for 15 years, but have remained friends and had a daughter, now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally devastated," said O Steen about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were absolutely best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O Steen said he had never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at a summer fair three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played one or the other gig together.</seg>
<seg id="45">O Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for different companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Juleps Room, a poorly lit bar near Gautier, said that he had lamb and Prentiss Night at the end of the night saw 5 September for the last time, after lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no indication that anything is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">"Just a happy couple," he said.</seg>
<seg id="50">We were in the cleanup efforts and joking with each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I think they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three small children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">At the Delta State campus in Cleveland, took part in a candlelight ceremony on Tuesday evening about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the vigil, during the Universitätschor sang "bright Morning Star" and "amazing Grace."</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We are trying to move our students to return home," said LaForge.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">The Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the emergency call after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency Prentiss has described as his wife, but there is no indication that the two have ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 poll numbers that show that Donald Trump is seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump, it did not work (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls showed in double digits, and some are beginning to ask themselves seriously, what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry's leadership has been handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of which have also won only one state in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now see Trump's stamina and begin to get their dollars flow in order to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump's popularity ratings have shot up to 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul in a positive way.</seg>
<seg id="15">By the middle of July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these figures are in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a positive opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two thirds of the GOP - GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">Last week, in a poll by CNN / ORC, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans, Trump's temperament is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticised for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters inclined to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul had the right temperament for a president, ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number applies in the first primary state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a leader, according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Still, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House, ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If your scholar hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four out of ten from the past week after a survey by CNN / ORC say that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters had not the clearest crystal ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared with only 28% of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, shows that a large number of GOP voters see Trump's campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump is still almost every.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely contributes to Trump's leadership during the anti - Trump Support diffusely distributed on more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">A Monmouth University poll in early September, however, shows that harvests the majority support in a hypothetical head to head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has 33 points against Carly Fiorina 13 point lead, 14 points, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head to head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A narrow majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS / NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that they have found their voices.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, a lot can happen in order to change this, and no one can really say, never to change their minds.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still, Trump's strongest competition at the moment of other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinion, are twice as often for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Ever since Donald Trump called "rapists" in his campaign speech to two months of immigrants from Mexico, immigration was the lynchpin in the public discourse to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic language will keep crucial Hispanic Americans from the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs efforts.</seg>
<seg id="54">But after the new ABC / Post poll on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">As long as immigration remains in the spotlight, it is apparently also do Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">The frustration over the government climbs to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now about half of support from Republican voters, especially by their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in 10 Republicans say in the new Monday - ABC / Post poll, they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A survey by Bloomberg / Des Moines Register in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans on the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, exasperated with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "same vein."</seg>

<seg id="2">Smokers, thus not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long term study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good news: Not decreases the risk quickly.</seg>
<seg id="4">Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is clear from the long term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="6">The risk of losing their teeth early compared with nonsmokers, smokers that you up to 3.6 times higher.</seg>
<seg id="7">The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.</seg>
<seg id="8">Causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the tooth meat stresses the DIfE.</seg>
<seg id="9">For this gum disease, smoking is a risk factor, say the authors.</seg>
<seg id="10">The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.</seg>
<seg id="11">Unknown to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.</seg>
<seg id="12">People who stop smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research. "</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP</seg>
<seg id="2">To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private arbitration for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional dishes in its operation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to set up a system, which the public trust," the competent EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Swede has to introduce the proposal as the European negotiating position in free trade talks with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">By TTIP is the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans to reform the current arbitration see specifically that the EU countries and the United States jointly select independent judges for a new investment Court.</seg>
<seg id="9">They should come to equal parts of the EU, the US and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is also, for the first time, a second instance.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would make it possible to appeal against sentences.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far the procedures involved with each other agreed to referee a chance to appeal against their sentences did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the debate over the past few months has become clear that the old system of ISDS citizens are not familiar in terms of fairness and justice, said Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long run they will work according to their own figures on an international investment tribunal.</seg>
<seg id="15">There could then be resolved, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU states.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor state arbitration required mainly by large corporations (ISDS) are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, riding on the company compensation at the expense of the taxpayer, can scuttle national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards.</seg>
<seg id="18">First opinions anti - TTIP organizations like Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="19">Criticism was, above all, that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).</seg>
<seg id="20">The German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) called the plans, on the other hand, a major advance.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission was prepared to take on board in the spring with other EU trade ministers in the reform of key points, the German economy minister Sigmar Gabriel.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitration is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules restrict the legal possibilities of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="25">Small and medium sized companies in particular could be adversely affected, they said.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the talks on the free trade agreement can be concluded TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership), remained unclear on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The negotiations run since the middle of 2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The issue of investor protection has been discussed but not with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally a framework for the agreement are already at the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This date is no longer tenable.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyn's debut in the Time of the Prime Minister</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr Corbyn's eagerly awaited debut in the Time of the Prime Minister</seg>
<seg id="3">The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut in the Time of the Prime Minister and for the first time with David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr Corbyn will probably rise up to make the first of his six preset questions shortly after midday, with his performance of the media and the Labour MP for the area will be examined.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said that he might skip some sessions to be left to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet, and after his speech to the TUC's annual meeting on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday to remain in silence during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has provoked criticism from a number of Tory most recent and is at the heart of several covers stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said that he had "been in a respectful silence" and he had "recognised the" heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain.</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they are called to differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him initially as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant said that political differences are also within Labour 'stack' after Mr Corbyn's remarks to the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour amendments on the table to remove the whole idea of a limitation in total.</seg>
<seg id="15">Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the cap of £26,000 to £23,000.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour chairman of the Tory leader David Cameron, since he is, in the last decade across the Dispatch Box in the House.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "crowd sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 comments.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will do both "repartee" and arguing with barbs and instead made to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister will represent him, if he does not participate - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak from time to time, and that he raised, John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, in order to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove themselves from the policy in the style of an "opinion" theater, which is often linked to the Time of the Prime Minister, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and its position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature and needs major reform.</seg>

<seg id="1">Metcash starts Bodenständigkeits campaign to fight Aldi- incursion</seg>
<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores from an ALDI march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a Bodenständigkeits campaign to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in a $700 million - ALDI - invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While although prepared for the opening of the first 120 stores and two distribution centres in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets to strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build on the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media just about events such as Adelaide's show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands such as find Simmo DUNS borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian Fußballliga to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that if the wholesaler for food, alcohol and devices holds its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is a lot at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA shops and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs Oststaaten IGA network.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the Oststaaten.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that ALDI is twelve months after opening its first markets around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states each time and will take away all the existing players, but mainly independent retailers sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report published in this week, the Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that $360 million in sales per year and Metcash IGA retailers could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This prediction is based on the assumption that although next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in Wa and achieve a turnover of $500 million and $600 million in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in food and grocery store and the amounts based on Metcashs high fixed costs Metcash could cost around $13 million of earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the Oststaaten, mainly at ALDI and Coles, although a recent poll by Roy Morgan found out that IGA - buyers are the most faithful.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes Metcashs sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016, will fall by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund manager told Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, at a business lunch in Melbourne today that Metcash will probably disappear within a decade, Metcash.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is believed that a member of Metcash has been in contact with Mr Douglass last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAs market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcashs food and grocery retailer, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, which reflects the operational debt reduction while putting pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the wholesaler refuses and investing more than $150 million to improve sale prices align with Cole's and the region for centuries in hundreds of products every week and IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Metcashs chief executive officer Ian D. Ferrin, and D. Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programmes will lay in Elan and hopes that the wholesaler in 2017 will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and the view of the Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as "Special KS" came into the spotlight by the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice had to be separated by the referee, and Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual artist behind Bernard against Great Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing that I am pretty ereifere is the fact that, in my view, a little Thanasi was drawn into the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around them, he has a great family around them, and I believe that he was treated a little too tightly.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard, and he fits into the team, and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important qualifiers, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return, as a long term is an integral part of the team. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"First of all, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not at all the controversy around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. Some time outside of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and gave everyone who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos followed as hundreds of migrants in a no man's land on the border ansammelten and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people who had fled from violence, stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries for an unknown period of time and built tents and settled down there.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations rose.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "open the border!" Chanted and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some were back in protest of food and water.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants were sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) will be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It must be held talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days, "said Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turmoil at the Hungarian / Serbian border came one day after the bloc of 28 nations could not agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers, however, agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in Italy and Greece überrumpelten. They expressed their hope that, in the next month or until the end of the year, finally reached an agreement that the EU countries would accept another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary,.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hungary continued, however, his hopes for a speedy action by Brussels or by its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">A state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could hammer roads and speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, meanwhile, that his country also plan the construction of a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania, in order to stop the influx of migrants from the country - after it has finished a fence on the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a major bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that the most purchased are economic migrants who are in search of a better life, and not war refugees, have the right to protection - a view that is sharply at odds with other EU countries, including Germany,.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing the border or the damage of 4 meters (13 feet) high fence, the government built along the southern border with Serbia, a crime. These laws are also higher prison sentences for convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation that has arisen as a result of the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament must still agree with procedural or the use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters from the Associated Press, heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs have already seen for days.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, national security adviser for Orban, said that authorities erwischten 45 people in an attempt to cross the border, 15 others were already penetrated deeper into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They come across, they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are in the process of quickly to repair the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon with barbed wire to close the borders, arrived on Tuesday morning.</seg>
<seg id="28">Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungarians hineinzudrängen opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and put a crowd there.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed to get inside, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's halved ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll</seg>
<seg id="2">Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58% previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (17 percent increase).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinions, it is clear which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more consistent than the other candidates in the election.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but these protrusions have reduced.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is here only by 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton still has a large lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double digit lead over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of the Democratic primary voters across the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support it with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support it because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only a quarter would enthusiastically support it.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton's supporters are also mentioned her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Support for dealing with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the Vice President raises a potential for the presidency in the balance, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">More than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead before Sanders, will increase by 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">55% of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most eligible" has risen.</seg>
<seg id="28">However, on the question of what is important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions of eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters is the primaries as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates bring good results in a number of important characteristics in their party's primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden performs best among the three candidates with honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views in general.</seg>
<seg id="35">In all of these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State continues to be asked, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans is now unhappy with its statement, while only about a third is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them as a whole: Only 32 percent among registered voters see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of eligible voters do not regard it as an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump will get good marks for leadership, however.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six tested candidates Biden, Carson and Bush cut best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority sees Sanders is more likely to be honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Baruch College - newcomer</seg>
<seg id="2">Almost two years after a student died during a ritual of bullying a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Brutally attacked members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta PSI fraternity chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, the police said.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said that he had been charged with related eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and have been repeatedly attacked, while he tried to reach out on a frozen field on a goal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta PSI fraternity called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="7">They had the time to switch to Deng's clothing, Googling his symptoms and to contact Andy Nordic, the national president of the Brotherhood, however, in order to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the Brotherhood in principle about the police chief Michael Deng," said Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng have been repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng's, said in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brotherhoods and their members must be brought to justice, and this step by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A Monroe County grand jury recommended a prosecution for murder, the third degree for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">32 members of the Brotherhood, including Mr volumes., are also accused of religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We do not want to blame only the people involved, but if there is one organisation that, officially or unofficially, has sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know how long it would take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the end.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and took 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor, such as the economy and the financial assets.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, market participants could say, however, that all the excitement was due to an increase in interest rates may be overdone.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal levels, but still too low to conduct a seismic shock many seem to fear.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look based on historical trends, as some sectors of the economy might respond:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There appears to be a tendency that asset returns are strangled 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's rate hikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, pretty flat for the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 per cent in the past six past cycles, according to a recent analysis, the Bob doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the growth cycle and begin the return to reduce.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote interest rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank was at 118 rate hikes since 1950 only nominal GDP twice under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question, "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have taken throughout the year on a Fed rate hike, and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study, all increase cycles have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP from 1950 to the present day and put on - recession highs very soon after the start of the recovery in the shadows," according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">By contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are now 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was also on the market as volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is pretty similar.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than that of stocks, if they change their strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">With bond yields seem to change the direction, as soon as the first increase / decrease takes place in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bond yields fall at the end of the growth cycle, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will mean that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">Higher income often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, lending margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tightened its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large companies that handle the greater part of their business in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of its debt as well.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to react, three months after an initial rate hike in a very positive way," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points each) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree, how quickly that will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham</seg>
<seg id="2">The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station because of its "dumbing down"</seg>
<seg id="3">He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">House colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this is not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "turns" on Classic FM, claims a leading member of parliament and increases new pressure on the channel, to prove that he does something the private broadcasters do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that public service radio is "verdumme" and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial competitors.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems like - I do not use the word" verdummen "- but it seems to turn on Classic FM," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, The Brits seem to be just under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So, if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC Director General rejected the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and information to the public.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I learned from Radio 3, I will learn about classical music anywhere else.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unmatched.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to commission new works, I think it really is important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that needs to be worked harder to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="17">Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport for the selection of commercial rivals to engage on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Tory MP Damien Collins resorted to the BBC - the musical talent show The Voice, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22 million.</seg>
<seg id="19">See you why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show, with Paloma Faith and boy George as a judge, "was produced on a special BBC way '.</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he would find that the company "a hit from our own stall," when we launch the next time an entertainment series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or to spend tax payers money on other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="1">Internet sales rose in August at the slowest and the Black Friday may be responsible</seg>
<seg id="2">In the first three months of the year 2015, there were seven percent increase in online sales.</seg>
<seg id="3">Last month there was the lowest result since the records began in 2000</seg>
<seg id="4">Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping</seg>
<seg id="5">Experts believe that the Black Friday has curbed spending in November</seg>
<seg id="6">For more than a decade, the virtual shopping geboomt and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="7">But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales stagnate, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">The total spending for August, the lowest increase in growth, the lowest since records began in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnant, after new figures indicate only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015</seg>
<seg id="10">"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has developed in the course of time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the Guardian IMRG sales index.</seg>
<seg id="11">He explained that the online sales increased from three years ago, when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="12">It meant that more people were able to shop online, and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="13">But now the commute, and we will probably experience reduced growth.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.</seg>
<seg id="15">Experts believe that buyers hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place each year on the last Friday in November,.</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year rallied five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bargains and some dealer websites plummeted.</seg>
<seg id="17">Experts believe that Black Friday, in which the buyer is fighting for bargains, could deter buyers to make purchases.</seg>
<seg id="18">A study by the British Retail Consortium found that spending just over £1 of £5 was spent online.</seg>
<seg id="19">For some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of the purchases are now done via web shops.</seg>
<seg id="20">More than a quarter of the people at the same time buying clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world observes, if the Fed comes together in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, in order to make the important decisions, whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="3">A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now thinks that the Fed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.</seg>
<seg id="5">"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero field and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, Senior staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>

<seg id="20">"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles</seg>
<seg id="21">The police said that lamb had phoned relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them, "he does not go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="22">When police officers drove him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night should overtake me, lamb his car to the side, fled on foot and ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>

<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead reflect a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one, a love interest, however, Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage, who died in 1991, was completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that were not suspicious enough, the text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed - Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book. Here is an unnamed boy Lorax Thneed rope ends once - ler, as the local environment by the greedy, trees be cases, despite the protests of the name give a Hock schnurrbärtigen nature, "it speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, of The Lorax 20 times in a row has not read to a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.</seg>
<seg id="12">Super camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but gave no further immediate comment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from England's team, but it is still difficult</seg>
<seg id="2">To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when you look at the squad, which was selected for the tour of England, a repeat of the 3 - 0 test series defeat is not on my map.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out a home victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side is probably less than it was three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars from 2012, only a youthful and positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin - Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related news: Adam Lyth leaves England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex catastrophic effect.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to let Adam Lyth, of course, is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago, the race would be extended from Lyth, but he had control over its own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, is another opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he is not so good services rendered, and this does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test - a man gets to put his character is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth had seven opportunities, such as Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only criticism one can make that Jonathan Trott, England first began in the Caribbean, when Lyth was in peak form, but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex is catastrophic, and he is a hit man, which I appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X factor - cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us on a Trent Bridge pitch 236, which hit us very much.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team at a position in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen beat along with Cook, which would provide an extra spin - Bowler and receive four Quicks appeared on, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why a man cannot beat them, and this has already shown that he is a vicious guy of cricket players left - handed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his county, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has made three hundred runs straight away and not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari is the spinner in the squad as back up, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People might see his statistics, an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball, and think it is a punt, but there are a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team, England has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of the batsman Mahela Jayawardene from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood is for the white ball - phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful force in the setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he has created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are in line with the above.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys teammate in Durham, Ben stokes, is not used in the One Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will disagree, but coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you have to remember that, as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are not taken with a light heart.</seg>

<seg id="2">David Cameron's crude Neuverhandlungs Strategy, in order to keep Britain in the EU, is deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn "Is it yes or no?" The leaders of Labour and the TUC for Europe on Tuesday the Serbs boycotted it.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners also have their Corbyn's and Nigel Farage's.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend said the other day that some member states, it is so deeply enmeshed in various crises, such as the EU, and not always from their own fault, Britain's own agendas are saturated with divided concessions and disruptive changes, which they usually do not want to.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it may be, if they threaten the social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could also call Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, a photo of himself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reform.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend who wants an outside view of Britain inside the EU tent - "Let us not only in France," says Berlin - and you can look through that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some cities have come to the point where it is no matter to them, whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's cautious prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them, as it happened in the overly long help arrested as Thatcher (11 years), Kohl and Mitterrand (14) (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François Hollande looks back on his reelection or his replacement in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a declining force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland may soon be a left a right nationalist government, Spain.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is hard to imagine that they will plug a leg to help the Selfie Britons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore may be planning some sort of minister even suspected of deliberately not helpful comments, quite the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017, in order to speed up the process of Brexit, my friend.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know how predatory the Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU sceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they were during the referendum in 1975 but not inspired by Tony Benn, that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can weakly remember Boris Johnson, the ore - euro opportunists, who has made a name for himself as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="19">For all its craziness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.</seg>
<seg id="20">This was part of the medley of tax - pseudo non - nationals and foreigners who own most of our major newspapers to describe - rogue, phone hack.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tony Blair really thought much about it, but found that if one is sitting in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distributed bananas to distract him, rather than to be his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was Blairianer more than Blair himself, when he opposed to Cameron's referendum Eddy, because Blair had not adopted the principle of the EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never forgiven him as well.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday, and I told him that he needed to waste no more time for me - seems in danger of Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch strategy to repeat the 80's, a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy in order to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Detroit, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am sometimes kind - in the development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, most people outside of Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the more wild climes of skeptics Klein Engländerismus everyone can say yes.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is what "A Benn, not a Bennite" Hilary Benn said on the radio and on television this week, as the scouts fought in it, not to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father on television that tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without having to go too far and lose his cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilarys fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">But to fight to remain "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC and his colleagues told MPs after all the reports on its closing session on Monday evening.</seg>
<seg id="33">Whatever the sentimental nature wants to give bottom - up image of Corbyn - remember that he has even touched me - news - discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock, and above all, in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe, which allowed him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course, as McDonnell said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyn's fundamental ambiguity to EU membership, in accordance with its Bennite Belagerungs economy, anti - capitalist past, is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes to the narcissism of small differences.</seg>
<seg id="37">As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is absolutely convinced that JC launches a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors at home in particular.</seg>
<seg id="38">If all of this can be useless, why should waste political capital of Paris or Berlin - they have also distrustful voters - in order to make concessions to the British?</seg>
<seg id="39">The US is already pretty disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction of the Tory government in power, which at the start on Monday, I was reminded of something called British Influence Security Forum.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise report by Public Health England on electronic cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims of a publicly funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined The Lancet, by they criticise the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE, the "principle" report published last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and highlighted the links between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis," based on the PHE's most important conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the allegations "built on sand or stone."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects that PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that electronic cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were convened in order to develop a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) Multi Criteria Decision Analysis - in order to have their opinions about the damage a synthesis of a number of products containing nicotine; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Cape said that is a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose directors have previously received from British American Tobacco (BAT) means for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed the BAT references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding, which he joined after reports were received by the tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the panel will not be delivered, but it includes several popular electronic cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate an industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the meeting was also attended by the tobacco control of PHE.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group's research "tellingly admits" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Cape well.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Cape said that the allegations of PHE, that "there is no evidence so far that e - cigarettes serve as a way for smoking for children or non smokers were" premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said that has already responded to the allegations by BMJ.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smoker dies from his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking, the national health system costs £2 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">Through the clear proof of current evidence that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used, in order to make the kind of programmes, which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for having to place public service programs, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, for solid window against their rival's most popular shows and channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC in his time at Channel 4 for six years.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I would have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sends, which is also clearly shown by not subsidized rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which in the medium or long term, I do not think it is a good idea, you should commission its production at least or with programs that others do not.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send The Voice in a prime time slot, because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could also be funded without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Voice is such a programme, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am doing my best to see how this is supposed to be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of ratings because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support. "</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes that give back to what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that public service rather niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they are doing their work, and they can argue that if they go on missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion of their hypocritical," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a window in which no one would ever see it.</seg>
<seg id="19">The broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thinking of you all, of course, we all think that one gets a great value for £150 per year here, but for people who for £150 is a lot of money, wonder if that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky and Channel 5 - chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission "to inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education, he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be making an example of public service television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the issue of partnerships Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and enter into alliances with the commercial channels, in order to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Genetics' brain cells can control by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses, which have high frequencies to the human ear, in order to be heard.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stimulus work through the activation of motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further on this subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sono Genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical impulses in the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thread worms are usually not on ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he was found to increase the ultrasonic waves, which then invade the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP - 4 Ion channels and cells are found in the membranes of some of the worms.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening up of these Ion channels and activating the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">In order to create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that bear some of their motor neurons TRP - 4 Ion channels.</seg>
<seg id="14">If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the change in motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that sono Genetics could have some advantages to this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light that needs to be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue low frequency ultrasonic waves can happen without hindrance and can then be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that it is possible to make the human neurons have been temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So, for example, for refugees, but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I can show how to build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees are in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people are to a large extent here.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the face of the refugee flow, we also need adequate housing in the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very commonplace, three storey terraced house is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house needs the least space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different, if it brings people in residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three units for each four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is manageable.</seg>
<seg id="23">Six months has taken the construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">The building regulations have complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: Construction law, I have learned through my project properly.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is particularly complicated always expect the looming sword and the pitch regulation.</seg>
<seg id="28">Gruselig.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities is not the place for it.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did the residents responded to her townhouse project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There have been those who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is definitely not true.</seg>
<seg id="35">But do not tighten the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: Is true: We had a construction boom in the last five years in Germany, but luxury apartments have been built, can hardly afford any more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message that ordinary people need housing too.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how we can still build well.</seg>
<seg id="40">That is what this is all about.</seg>
<seg id="41">Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analysis.</seg>

<seg id="22">In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian - Serbian border, which had hitherto brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday in Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="23">The government in Belgrade anweise denied, however, that it is the people to embark on certain routes: "Neither we, nor do we want to do this," it said.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to media reports is in any case a first bus in the morning with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, more buses are expected over the course of the day.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The inmates had been travelling all night from the Macedonian border, about 500 kilometres away from Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary has closed down, so the police has said that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">They wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">This could actually come to the postponement of the Balkan route to date already predicted by observers of Turkey - Greece - Macedonia - Serbia - Hungary on a track located to the west.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Extensive opportunities for border control"</seg>
<seg id="31">Politics of Croatia's interior minister had previously stressed that his country was prepared for possible emergency situations appropriate plans in the event of a strong influx of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="32">Details he was not, he however pointed out that Croatia as non Schengen members have extensive opportunities for border control.</seg>
<seg id="33">We have strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">Slovenia is a good testimony that since 2007, the EU partners represent the country consistently since then, as regards the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serb side are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence to about 300 refugees.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports she had spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing that leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities remain the two crossings Horgos and Backi gradually continue to be completely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Interior Minister Nelise Stefanovic tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Horgos: It seems the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed, to be premature.</seg>
<seg id="40">Currently, it would not be very high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="41">It could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Helper rates to migrants - and dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes are drawn by Croatia.</seg>
<seg id="44">The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, however, is not without risk: In some parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the war in Croatia has still not cleared minefields.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of Minenräumern has been sent to the border region.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is intense operation around the Mannheim parade ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">People do their errands, some quick step, in part for a breath of fresh air.</seg>
<seg id="4">They control the two stations of the Mannheim auto salons at Paradeplatz.</seg>
<seg id="5">Keep city tracks.</seg>
<seg id="6">Vibrant, long life in beautiful autumn sunshine and four large panels in the middle with the headline "Before I die I want..."</seg>
<seg id="7">The Ecumenical hospice help drew attention to their 20th anniversary with this action and it is faced with mixed reactions.</seg>
<seg id="8">"It is killed, so we are left with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," said Josefine Lammer.</seg>
<seg id="9">The head of the Ecumenical hospice help is also available for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff of the passersby.</seg>
<seg id="10">While many a passerby spontaneously added to chalk and affirm the sentence about "my life," "read," "with the campers to travel through the United States," "stop the war" or "not suffer long, others are short, read, say phrases such as" so far, I am not yet "and then go on.</seg>
<seg id="11">Always develop small discussions about the action itself, about life on the edge, dealing with the death.</seg>
<seg id="12">Peter Hübinger is also currently on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Only when I make clear that comes at the end of the world for me, I can live in a responsible manner," says the director of the work of Diakonischen Mannheim, which together with the Carita "is winner of the Ecumenical hospice help.</seg>
<seg id="14">Therefore, this visible action is good for 20 year olds.</seg>
<seg id="15">That not everyone wants to share publicly on the boards, but is understandable, because if it is a very personal thing.</seg>
<seg id="16">The subject of death and dying is still riddled with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement have helped a lot in the last few years, open for the people.</seg>

<seg id="18">The companion Sterbe- and sadness is one of the volunteers in the first hour.</seg>
<seg id="19">Confronted by personal experience with the subject, they read a lot of literature and decided to engage in euthanasia.</seg>
<seg id="20">When the Ecumenical Hospice sought help by calling volunteers, they have reported immediately and had been present at the creation in 1995.</seg>
<seg id="21">Gode cold belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied the patients and relatives in private homes, hospitals, nursing homes and the Hospice of St. Vincent.</seg>
<seg id="22">They are all carefully trained.</seg>
<seg id="23">Angelika Godefroid can deal well with their job and the lessons and experiences here.</seg>
<seg id="24">"I see life from a different perspective, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The offer of the Ecumenical outpatient hospice service is free and independent of confession.</seg>
<seg id="26">The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from individuals and foundations enables the training as well as training and supervision of Sterbe- and grief companion.</seg>
<seg id="27">Every two years will be offered training for new employees.</seg>

<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook for an entire year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to pursue some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The shares fell about 2.5 percent in Premarket - 45 minutes before the opening of trading on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said that to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in fiscal year, which ends next May, 20 cents less than its previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts expected, according to a survey by FactSet 10,84 $.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which amount to an average of 4.9 percent and be effective on January 4 and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages collected from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year because of reduced costs, increased revenue and because of the growth in online trading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade,."</seg>
<seg id="11">The plans for the holidays - jobs were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to recruit additional workers, about the same number as last year, 90,000 to 95,000.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, an increase of 6 percent from the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2,42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, predicted the twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.</seg>

<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating income was essentially flat due to higher costs for larger packages and even insurance.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At its most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Disrespectful about them at one end of the ornate, two storey sitting room is a mural of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The card is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximizing the US employment and keep prices stable here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will start on Thursday announced that the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate near zero since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for federal debt - and it is only about a quarter percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin Maklerfirma Bodies Nicolaus & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the heightened uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which confuses the financial market in itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets expect the Fed waiting, however, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This points to a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the strategists to soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday 16.599,85 jumped on the Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert 228,89 points or 1.4%.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy upholds the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If you do it, "they would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets, so that they do not panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">As recently as a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">In spring and early summer, Yellen had said that this year they expect despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed, an increase in the rate.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the level the Fed considers full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And even though inflation was consistently below the central bank's 2% annual target, the Fed's representative said that the main reason was the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market, "said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world had zuckten late last month, after China devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones Industrial Durchschnittswert fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat in this month, while the Dow is now at almost 10% below the peak in May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed's representatives should influence the market turmoil the complex calculation when you increase the interest rate.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now says he predicted that they would wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.</seg>
<seg id="33">The health of the global economy is none of the Fed's main concern, so technically they should not be involved in their decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end, the Fed has become the world's monetary authority.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank was enormously in the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint of the former leader could "narrow" Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed's monetary expansion in 2013, triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be expected from the Fed representatives that they not only monitor the developments in other places, but also with other central banks, experts advise, in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the company's asset management Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, va., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which are apparently not linked to the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is committed to a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the US," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should set only during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England to set interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil do not come near this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"It is certainly not in the situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I do not believe that they should rush ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="4">The roof should be flat for solar plant.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plans for the long awaited turn pictures on Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the elaborated Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.</seg>
<seg id="6">The panel had previously decided, among other things, a request for a demands an "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.</seg>

<seg id="8">A "saddle roof with concentric First and roof should therefore be built on state '.</seg>

<seg id="2">The hospital Albania should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) of new medical director at Schongau hospital.</seg>
<seg id="4">The station, as well as the majority of the employees draw from Albania to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="5">See the surprising plans of the hospital of the district confirmed Landrätin Andrea Jochner - White.</seg>
<seg id="6">A decision, however, meet the Supervisory Board, and the meeting next Wednesday, September 23.</seg>
<seg id="7">If the plans are implemented, then all of nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in Albania.</seg>
<seg id="8">The vast majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the still existing inside station.</seg>
<seg id="9">The rooms are available.</seg>
<seg id="10">The staff who cannot to Schongau is expected to be offered a job in Weilheim, Jochner - White.</seg>
<seg id="11">The employees were informed of the plans.</seg>
<seg id="12">Triggered the switch changes the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who is medical director of the city hospital only since the beginning of the year and now at a private practice in the more immediate vicinity of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the question of who should take the succession came into play according to Jochner - white, the name "fishermen" who agreed to take the line on 1 October, and with his team to switch to Schongau.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the house in Schongau means that in each case an "appreciation" and an expansion of the offer in the area of "internal medicine," so Jochner - White.</seg>
<seg id="15">Fischer is a specialist for pacemakers and defibrillators.</seg>

<seg id="18">So far, the district had this planned for 2018, when the current renovation is completed at the hospital of Weilheim.</seg>
<seg id="19">Landrätin Jochner - White, who is also chairman of the supervisory board, came rumors that the house, located in the possession of the Bundesknappschaft should in future be used as accommodation for Asylbeweber.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I support that." As it continues with the property, Jochner - White could not say that there are a number of considerations.</seg>
<seg id="21">A short term care of Caritas, there are currently housed a day psychiatry.</seg>
<seg id="22">"What better things could not happen, such an opportunity comes on the virtual parade at the Lech, which has been accepted by the employees" positive and very understanding "not again," says Fischer.</seg>
<seg id="23">A real prospect for the house in which fishermen for more than 30 years working as a chief doctor, it did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="24">He had been asked by city colleagues, to assume the post of medical director.</seg>

<seg id="9">Some people in the village of 1200 inhabitants is about dozen corners is related to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from much in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do the villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?</seg>

<seg id="21">The foundation of the real estate company were first land purchases in New York.</seg>

<seg id="23">He did not include Trump because he once was hewn down without permission, had declared a film start of Roland Paul, director of the Institute for pfälzische history and folklore.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in contrast to the sometimes bombastic statements of descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">Had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"As the noise, it is not so nice," says Hans Bender, a distant relative of Trump's ("The grandmother was born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").</seg>
<seg id="28">The retired vintner aufbrausend sees the Americans rather aloof, "he is always so."</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he think that Trump is?</seg>

<seg id="31">"He has never much bothered about."</seg>
<seg id="32">Pension innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentioned as some Kallstadter arrived in a visit, a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ, which is generally good.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I cannot imagine the Donald," says the 68 years old.</seg>
<seg id="34">You think it would be better if he has not treated the election, because "the such radical views, I do not know whether this is a good thing."</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, he would have been, "he would never arrived at all."</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzer daughter Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as President?</seg>
<seg id="38">"It is not my President," she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: "The grapes are also ready for Trump without the president."</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for obese people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether, after the weight loss surgery, slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer than those who received non surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data will need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in the weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in Jama Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity surgery have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people who are pathologically obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers used data from Taiwan's Min Sheng General Hospital since 2007, they have collected in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube education, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who are subjected to this operation, fell from 31 to 24.5 in this study by the end of the fifth year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received no surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal in 29</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who are subjected to a surgical operation, triggered the diabetes disease completely and some at 28% to 36%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically treated group was fully in just one percent in the comparison of diabetes and, in part, with only about two percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results were generally better at the controls blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in the surgery group," the authors found.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers monitored the patients' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, write the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level by about 9 percent to about 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at around 8%.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" - as is reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reduced the mortality rate in five years, as the Chief researcher Dr. Chih Cheng HSU and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a more complete elimination of diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of more difficult people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, it was in obese people, who have undergone obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried konventionellere methods.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, Blackstone said, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group," no increased risk of death or a kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight is seriously, as soon as the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think that we have to wait until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies have strongly linked with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard. "</seg>

<seg id="5">He claimed that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.</seg>
<seg id="6">He also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.</seg>
<seg id="8">Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Look after several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long term solutions, such as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.</seg>

<seg id="5">He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or because Mutprobe in social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young people have allegedly disinfectants mixed with alcoholic mouth water to get a tougher drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be enticed by attractive smells of disinfectant.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child does not, that this is bad for it," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are the ones who are perfumed.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectants with textures, wine grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hands disinfectant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Especially for young children just a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It is highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of the University of Kansas, told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.</seg>

<seg id="17">Your blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is regarded as a drunk at an adult by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah lallte her words and was not in a position to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored overnight they had met with signs of brain trauma, because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and the head in a separate children's hospital, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," said Scott Ortoria Nhaijahs mother, CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It would be fatal to my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers to use soft products or disinfectant wipes and hand disinfectants to keep out of the reach of children.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.</seg>
<seg id="24">In 2013, two women in Ontario women died after swallowing of hand disinfectants, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January, three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York, planned to poison their "nasty" teacher, by claiming antibacterial products around the classroom, "as it reports a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and banned them from their space.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police saw the failed plan as "chatter" and disciplinary action referred to the school authority.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I will be a witness to an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man being put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma state penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was already on his best friend for the first time in January, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day was nearing, I began to fear me.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed, because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would provide a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and as many more applications than places available, will take place a macabre lottery to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Anyone who is selected, it will observe without emotion.</seg>
<seg id="13">I cannot do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit alongside Richard Glossips inner friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a visit to two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We often laugh a lot when we are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I must simply try to remind me of all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me to abandon my impartiality on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">They admitted that they "can make it better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things that I have said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He tells me not what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants an international reporter is present, in order to write.</seg>
<seg id="28">When he dies, he thinks that will help the public relations of the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim Bell, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts that I have made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I am not going to go back on all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty, to be a beneficiary of the deed.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective, I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters, to whom you can turn for this.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.</seg>

<seg id="1">Peter Moody claimed that stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end the racing</seg>
<seg id="2">Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to quit the race immediately.</seg>
<seg id="3">It was aimed at the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they held a personal campaign against him for a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, with the late scratching of Lady Tatai.</seg>
<seg id="4">Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing and he had found himself under difficult conditions, when it came to the cobalt positive swab test at Lidaris he cannot explain.</seg>
<seg id="5">He had withheld 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like at high hanging grapes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"I had nothing to say about it, and I've been sitting on this for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.</seg>
<seg id="7">They know that it went further.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sometimes it reacts, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with that, what I said.</seg>
<seg id="9">I will go home tonight and sleep well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would like to go around with my head held high, and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them.</seg>
<seg id="11">If you start to think that I am not doing that, then I should no longer be the coach.</seg>
<seg id="12">I have to consider, then, what I do with my license.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moody had previously let the bomb in an interview with racing.com high that Integritäts department had tried to spy on his stall.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I shall name, if I am asked, and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I do in my stables," Moody said on Racing.</seg>
<seg id="15">They obviously believe that I am a fraudster.</seg>
<seg id="16">If this is the case, you should certainly take on their noses because they have failed in a bid to catch me.</seg>
<seg id="17">Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of it at the time, and there are still today.</seg>
<seg id="18">Should bring me to the view that it personally?</seg>
<seg id="19">Has the RVL cowardly behaviour, and makes people outside of trainers may be responsible for what is happening in the industry?</seg>
<seg id="20">Am I bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="21">Am I so bad for the industry?</seg>
<seg id="22">Perhaps people think out there that I am.</seg>
<seg id="23">They may have to take my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say will consider it now.</seg>
<seg id="24">But I'm now at the point where I think the matter is, and that makes me sad.</seg>
<seg id="25">This makes me really sad.</seg>
<seg id="26">I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="27">I have the support of my family and I can go.</seg>
<seg id="28">Frustrations levels of trainers have built up with the prolonged cobalt investigation in Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he "could take his license on the table."</seg>
<seg id="29">Moody, best known for its preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, described the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses, which was against the rules.</seg>

<seg id="1">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy proposes ring to fight back against rivals because of allegations</seg>
<seg id="2">Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism at the tack of his players as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players "ring" struggles with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled reference to the Storm team, after his team had reached the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model" of the rugby league and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy, the Tacklimg defended his team and said that they were at the tack, focusing only on their "contact".</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of the two leading trainers on his team made him confident agree, because it means that they are concerned, to be beaten by the Storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"It appears over and over again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling fights, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has been the trend for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is now there for three years, and he obviously has a great team to train. He is therefore probably not accustomed to lose, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is funny how this appears again and again at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has attacked the Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and recalled his mentor, that Bennett's St George Illawarra dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "long because a" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting the game was, "Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in 2010, St George has been criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said that he is a shit dirt will look into this matter.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game that you want to play, if you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants to play the kind of football that everyone - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build stronger confidence, because they say these things, because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they have probably not thought of us, when it came to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm game against Roosters reached a higher result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos game was a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20: 18, there were two further attempts in our game, but this is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or breaks and no points are a little bit more exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it is the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage on it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys and the Cronulla Sharks in the Vorfinale at AAMI Park on Saturday night. The ticket sale starts from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="5">Despite a potentially life whole sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount and that the cafe for an innocuous reason might have been.</seg>
<seg id="6">The judges on the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of flight in Maksimovic.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has strong relations with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="8">He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 deposit as security together, in order to achieve his release.</seg>
<seg id="11">"After reading the oaths stately statements of the two people, it is clear that the imposition of a $200,000 security represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.</seg>
<seg id="12">But that alone will not be enough to stop him, not to appear, he warned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he delivers his Australian and his Serbian passport, report daily to the police, and adheres to a curfew from 6: 00 to 06: 00.</seg>

<seg id="5">Those affected can even then hope for money, according to the judges, if they were only a few days locked in tight spaces (ref.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).</seg>
<seg id="6">Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009, so that a former prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful: He was in the prison hospital, housed in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then the man, according to his lawyer has now been released, has been moved to a larger cell.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create that"</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.</seg>
<seg id="3">What comes to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) Germany is even capable of a million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has shown determination in light of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we do that."</seg>
<seg id="6">What is in store for Germany gives the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Homes a year are needed for different forecasts between the Bundesbauministeriums 350000 (estimate) and 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) - and in the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is almost twice as much as before is built choices (housing).</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially for affordable rental properties: Every year, there are 60,000 to 80000 social housing out of the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing refugees will also apply.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion, from currently $518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Far too little is that from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that the federal government would have to invest in a promotion to the tune of $6.4 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists and federal construction minister agree on is that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it can be assumed that 55 per cent of the area in the long term can be employed in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees in Germany would not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them get started, criticises Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees, however, is crucial, whether they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self - esteem of immigrants, says migration for Cher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, there has been a political change according to Thränhardt: The ban on work for refugees on the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years in the past, this was limited to three months, as well as the residence requirement, the asylum seekers at a residence in November 2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">In society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - mostly the view prevailed that refugees should be allowed access to the labour market more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of German language skills.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies also show that jobs are most commonly transmitted through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction of networks is the royal road to integration work according to Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration has found that only a few parents give their children in the key signature, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents only once, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Department.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family still to be convinced of the benefits of this option, the administration distributed hand slip in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">Should the need for educators to rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing multiple schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In those countries, students are not prepared to welcome classes on the teaching of English.</seg>
<seg id="28">But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, including from teachers who only have a qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers Schulverwaltung from Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Deutsches Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no state prohibits asylum seekers or patience, the study - the only exception has been Berlin, Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitating access to university.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permits or more if they begin a study of asylum seekers will receive no benefits under the current law.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter are generally no Bafög, since they do not fall within the circle of people entitled to trainees.</seg>
<seg id="35">CADTM refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, to be Bafög - justified, in that span is shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap needs to be closed, however, claim crash, Berlin's undersecretary for science, and the Deutsches Studentenwerk Steffen.</seg>
<seg id="37">The students should receive Bafög.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should give the same rights to Islam gradually as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right to develop a new state religions relationship.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would also be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association of professional cares about the new arrivals.</seg>
<seg id="41">Belong to the rights and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="42">As the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and to give him some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes the willingness to take bold action against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">Ayman Mazyek, the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited their right to dwell here, in Germany, immediately," he said in the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will be much more than an issue of the whole society today in the future.</seg>
<seg id="48">It will also have to change the majority of society, will be pressing the elimination of discrimination and racism.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has a point against discrimination and a general equality law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it learns very slowly, as the spirits - murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all, not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups have been demanding and what international agreements such as the Anti Racism Convention oblige Germany needs to become a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities, for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany is able to supply the refugees expected to date medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="53">"With regard to MAN power and capabilities, we create it," he told the daily mirror.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, should make extra money flowing into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, calls for Montgomery, hand over all arrivals for the registration of health cards.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services provided could be charged later with the provinces.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long term, it is highly questionable to mislead so many people with a limited catalog of performance, the performance of the asylum law propose.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">So far, it has proven the Berlin Gesundheitswissenschaftlerin Thea Borde, migrants are less aware of their disease than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in hospitals, but also in medical practices, interpreting costs would have to be accepted, she asks.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many refugees would have helped but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic views.</seg>
<seg id="63">Among refugee children, for example, will give it much more unprocessed disability, and go to HIV awareness among young people.</seg>
<seg id="64">German doctors came with the images of some other disease in terms of their education but clear, says Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasite infections and tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as regards the shortage of doctors is perhaps even relief in sight by the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, and may once again professional examinations.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK): Most are suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK explains.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder is ill, including so called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, and palpitation Todesängsten.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, strong shock and emotional numbness.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent the symptoms were chronic, early treatment is needed, Munz said.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Mentally ill asylum seekers in social services can make a request for psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">Most clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness, in social services would also decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to misjudgments, Munz said.</seg>

<seg id="26">Abuse in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations.</seg>
<seg id="27">Stephanie Probst also takes this position: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each canvas of pranks.</seg>
<seg id="29">The "four legged artists," as they are affectionately called, is to read each desire of the eyes.</seg>

<seg id="35">"But then, suddenly, there was our small Jumbo," says Brigitte Probst.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Zebroid is still not ready for the riding school, it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst, however.</seg>
<seg id="37">For every visitor should therefore be something.</seg>
<seg id="38">"One thing is for sure," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always give our best and do it with all my heart."</seg>

<seg id="5">"This restructuring will allow for a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, to lead the unit after the separation.</seg>
<seg id="6">"HP Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses, the companies support the transition to a new style of doing business," Whitman said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must stand behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to Wilshere, that it was only in September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given his history, his participation in next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had found the last season had finished strong after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old swing back during the early season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This type of injury threatened not to pursue a career," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that has not healed well.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also develops an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The study by Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs who have recorded the most violation days in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season will continue.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat force," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body is stabilised, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey are not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and the players that we need to take a little breather," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the kebabs stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest intimidation effect.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is also after 41 games unbeaten after the "invincible" campaign has been launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal has learnt the lesson of the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope, with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2006 we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business, in order to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not a dreamer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends: The comedy show, which grants us serious lessons about male friendships</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now has become even more desperate than ever, as shown on a 15 year high suicide rates among young men.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of calling into question the culture that prevents men to seek help if they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is at the heart of the fight, in order to meet this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that, if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy" mood, doubled his chances of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But, of course, you have to have friends first, so a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of communications conducted on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, funny and successful life, even if in reality dominates the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has a profound impact on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And like a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money cannot buy happiness really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been put on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was not defined by his work, but his personality, which was due to the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing between Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my audience role for people who feel depressed and are at risk of suicide, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I come to make sense of it" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if you talk about problems openly. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer more permanent management mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">They clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objective outsider status on the phone may also help the people in times of despair, the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, if you visit this weekend Comedy Central friends stuck with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink with the Central perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, better yet, if you see someone just sitting around in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - tied for # friends</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria is, in order to help PSG to crush Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates after his match against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria is in his debut in the Champions League in Malmö on Tuesday and help PSG pull over.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the game report and the response to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course, when Paris Saint Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 - 0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the road, but then they missed a number of opportunities, before they finally increased their lead when Cavani a Kopfballtor scored in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions, as they not only want the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances in front of goal. He was replaced later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League, so it is a good start to win 2: 0 to cause problems to our opponents and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that in the course of the season, we have yet to perfect," said Blanc.</seg>
<seg id="10">"This is a good omen.</seg>
<seg id="11">We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet reached one or two more goals. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Manuel returned in one of three changes in the Paris team after his injury, which could keep a 2: 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league at the weekend, but he has been surpassed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine striker has been described as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, when it was taken over by Manchester United in the last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis pass behind the defence in Malmö, before he graduated nicely in the corner of the net past Johan Wiland.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, if someone believed that PSG would make a great victory, was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play off, in order to reach this stage, came with nine national players on the field at Anpiff and strung with a five man defence and two deep in the midfield was a serious opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic went far past Kevin Music posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG patzte even sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not least by Inter, with no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, he showed much more skill, which was directed by Wiland past the post in the 52nd minute, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Manuel Di Maria turned into a spin shot...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The pampero scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter had got a left flank of Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, the end result could keep low, before substitute players was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, announced later that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifying games are not enough. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris. "</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game from them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the crown of thorns (gilt) is one of the main works Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus Altepost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not in the Otmar Alt Bible now appeared with beautiful images.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with bright colors and imaginative forms has received the 75 years old - but by no means is synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary, adapted to the particular issues, it may well seem rather bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken from the many areas of the "book of all books" a subjective artistic choice.</seg>
<seg id="10">The result are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as crossroads, plagues, bids or Our Father.</seg>
<seg id="11">He is fascinated on several partners: This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler publisher with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost who has dealt with the relevant biblical passages on the basis of painting.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so on Today, "translated" in the current context.</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and one sentence each of the artist, who has put his own personal thoughts on the current situation.</seg>
<seg id="16">The jewelry box has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">This allows the 75 year - old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Christmas orders at all.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Since the education with the cane ever happened," recalls Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I have tried to do the father come to me perhaps again with the Lord."</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern was to help the art at the time passes back to more importance: "The perception of worlds is now dominated by advertising, and is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is out there.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this regard, I am a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images' fall ', they can act on it, and feel what power they have: "The picture is his counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation, "always been" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he sees life with his pictures."</seg>
<seg id="29">Age did not care to fully comprehend the Bible, but are important to him, also selected mysterious issues.</seg>
<seg id="30">"This was no cooperation on an equal footing," all old post explained: "This is about the images, the text says." The result is a picture Bible.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from publishers Luther is this work to find an invitation, "to deepen his life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler both the responsibility and the (biblical) language of love.</seg>
<seg id="33">Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, which opened on November 15 in the Otmar Alt Foundation.</seg>

<seg id="11">In all probability, he will also deny the second game.</seg>

<seg id="1">Robot cars: Government will lead to Germany</seg>
<seg id="2">Germany should be technological advancements in the transformation of the car after the will of the federal government.</seg>
<seg id="3">The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, among other things, investment in the development of digital infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="4">Dobrindt spoke of a "new automotive era on Wednesday on the sidelines of the IAA auto show in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="5">The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide for less congestion, Dobrindt said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, at the IAA also meet with representatives of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="7">The strategy of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">The testing of new technology is currently a test track at the Highway 9 in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="9">To be saddled with the driver "no additional liability risks," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, to adapt to the new developments."</seg>
<seg id="10">Like Germany, for example, internationally to ensure that the speed limit for cars drive themselves will be increased from 10 to 130 km / h.</seg>
<seg id="11">The federal government will also push for a revision of the Vienna Convention, which so far only the people as drivers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In automated driving takes the lead in increasing the car, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the surroundings and process the information in a matter of seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">Yet driverless vehicles on public roads "were to be expected until well after 2020."</seg>
<seg id="16">The added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving features in Germany, the study's authors estimate for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician Sören Bartol.</seg>
<seg id="18">The question of liability in the event of an accident and the security of the personal information of the driver should be clarified, however.</seg>
<seg id="19">Yet the Germans see cars drive themselves skeptical, however, much more than the French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">A poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dekra presented on Wednesday at the AA has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, in 20 years with this count of 32 percent, 31 percent do not think at all about it.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33% by 2025 with autonomous driving cars in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self driving vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to cede control over the entire ride on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the motorway could imagine that as much as 15% in flowing traffic, 45 percent in a traffic jam.</seg>
<seg id="25">Good one in four car would leave the control under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures - "shop of horrors": The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: Thanks to video projections, the mannequins look frighteningly human.</seg>
<seg id="4">They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was with her stage outfits for the big star of the fashion scene, among other things, and that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture, because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"In the past it was bleached, now it is real," Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="7">For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is to be seen in the Kunsthalle der Hypo - Cultural Foundation from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial opposition to a show about his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you die, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had previously made station in Montreal, Canada and in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight into the little plant to have views of the man who has made history of fashion without ever having completed an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the show has not been established, but it is an excellent choreographiertes total art work, for which there was a great deal of effort: To cook the puppets, for example specially hired a stylist.</seg>
<seg id="15">14 tons of material, the makers have that according to the curator Thierry Maxime Loriot to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest was a special treat: A leather pants outfit with a corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Horse animal old teddy is on display in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is fashionable for the first, tentative steps of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was a good student and a bad thing in football), he attracted to his teddy bras and dresses, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">His parents would not allow him to play with a doll.</seg>
<seg id="23">The design of fashion, he taught themselves later.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and was told the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later, I bought it of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first own fashion show, he cannot pay for the models.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewellery instead of curtain - "head as a fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">Before it went to the long stick machines in and around Plauen, to make metres.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace were further processed in large quantities for customers such as blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">That alone no longer works, explains Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of Plauen fashion tip.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the "top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the domestic textile industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt cites some examples: Head in jewellery, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">At Stanford University, called the vintage fashion, much of past eras, an increasing order potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, they already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen lace and embroidery is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Only they can bear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years has about 80 percent of sales.</seg>
<seg id="14">Private shops and wholesale, there is almost no more.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The mass manufactured goods will be much cheaper in Asia today and sold almost exclusively on chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, the export schwächle, currently in Russia and in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">So enough reasons for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association also tries to score by environmental awareness as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we produce a quality seal, which shows that we are ecologically and socially acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches Berger in the snow of Westsächsischen Hochschule Zwickau, at the Faculty of Applied Arts, and specializes in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">Find high quality and innovative products to counter the competition from the Asian region.</seg>
<seg id="23">This takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the businesses in particular need to think economically, "Schmidt said.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly in order to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago revived the historic pyramid top textile designer Kati Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine uses small beads in some places.</seg>
<seg id="28">The "gold champion Bianca Hallebach Krauße could inspire them:" Before I could not start with traditional "top."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the pyramid tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region identify with the subject" tip - young and old, "Reuter said.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also supplies in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers, whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.</seg>
<seg id="33">I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of the "tip.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and expect consumers to a much higher dose of nerve gifts.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Food Watch before an appropriate working paper the EU sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policy will be passed on to pregnant women and infants with full force," said Matthias Wolfschmidt Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to Wolf Schmidt, the limits of the nerve poison for big fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish or Hai- for "economic reasons" are to be increased from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">Large predatory fish are already so contaminated with mercury, however, that cannot be sold on the basis of the current limits of about 50 percent of the catch.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit only 14.5% would become unsaleable.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return for the easing the EU according to Food Watch wants to tighten limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Food Watch described it as a "trick" because smaller peaceful fish such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the planned levels.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in small fish is "a perfides diversionary tactic, that alone will help the economy," Wolf Schmidt explained.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for the people that greatly enriching themselves through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government warns that that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system," especially in unborn.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Environment explains on its website in relation to the current levels, however, that a "health risk to the general population" is not to be expected.</seg>
