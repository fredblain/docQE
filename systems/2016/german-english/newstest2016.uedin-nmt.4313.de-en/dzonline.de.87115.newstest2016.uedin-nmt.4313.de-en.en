Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
At the heart of the fair are networked, self-driving cars and electromobility until 27 September.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show under the motto "mobility" on Thursday.
The wide audience can attend Saturday's IAA.
The organisers of the auto association VDA expect about 900 000 visitors as they did two years ago.
