Rome now has a Martin-Luther-seat
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther-square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino on Wednesday, a previously nameless place in the park on the Oppio Hill was christened the name of the German Reformist.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero," he is now recognized as the "German Theologist of the Reformation."
The park is located in the heart of the old Rome, right next to the Coliseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Ossetian community in Rome, recalled Wednesday that Protestants in the city of the pope over centuries as a minority were often only allowed to live in secret their faith.
The square becomes symbolically visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was regarded as a young Augustinian m√∂nch around the turn of the year 1510/11 some months in Rome.
He found the city at the time as an outdated scapegoat.
His negative impressions may have encouraged him, according to historians, in his later battle against Rome.
Luther then initiated the division of the evening's Church with his theses against the decline.
