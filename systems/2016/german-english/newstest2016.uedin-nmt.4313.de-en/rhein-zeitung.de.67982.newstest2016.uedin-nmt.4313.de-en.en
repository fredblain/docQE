Love story plays out in the Hunsr√ºck
It's an issue that's getting more attention in fiction at the moment: A young woman, at school times unpopular and unsightly, meets the swarm of her youth for years, and this falls in love with her.
So even in the recently published novel "We are not so" by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsback readers, because he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is delighted that she has been able to set a literary monument to her home town.
