Champions League: Baylor's dream start thanks to Müller and Idol
Two-time goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3-0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then ran.
A sovereign prelude to the Champions League season.
The world champions Thomas Müller and Mario Idol have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the witchbowl of Piraeus.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their kickoff in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müllers's double-pack (52nd/90+ 2) and Idol hits (89th) earned by 3: 0 (0: 0).
The twelfth star success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola will finally bring the Henkelpott to Munich in the third attempt.
At his 28th match in the Champions League, Müller received friendly support from Olympiakos-Torwart Roberto, who made a shot of the world champion as a flanker.
"We're not going to underestimate them," Baylor captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game at the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hottest fans - and the Munich held word.
They showed a focused and dedicated idea without shining.
Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the premier class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund (1: 3) also stumbled here.
But Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They went boldly, but they were often too unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
The attacks have been launched too often by game shift on left-hander Douglas Costa, who has rarely come through against former Zealand's Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had been more lucky from the right when his flanker slipped out of the right half-field in the left upper gate.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave up the possible 2: 0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, as Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown beat Poland's headball from the line (26th).
Then by direct delivery, the goalkeeper Roberto with his knee pared (35).
Although Bayern moved to their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set needle sticks.
On goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, though, was leaving.
So, for example, when he steered a shot of Ideye over the latte (56th).
Before Neuer, Guardiola was allowed to defend a four-seater with David Alaba at the centre alongside Jerome Boateng, who made it good.
Mario Idol, after muscular problems back in the caddie, first sat outside.
The World Cup hero was given the green light only after the final training session, said athletic director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different from this is already malignant."
Even at the first change, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the troubled Lewandowski (59th).
Idols arrived late for Arturo Vidal (7-6) and made it all clear 13 minutes later, by Elfmeter, Müller added one more.
Before the game, it was in the stadium to tie.
After a smaller group of partially married Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces attacked and walked out with batters against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern-Fan was transported out of the stadium.
