Ishinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich security conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility.
"I believe the determined reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collective ways."
Four years ago, one was pleased that the Kelch had gone past a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is ending up on our doorstep," he said in German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
