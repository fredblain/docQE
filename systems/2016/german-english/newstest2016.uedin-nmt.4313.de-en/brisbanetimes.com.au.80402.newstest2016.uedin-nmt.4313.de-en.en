Metcash launches ground level campaign to fight Ald. incursion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches ahead of an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground level campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a $700 million Aldi invasion.
During Aldi's opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the brand IGA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media, as well as events such as Adelaideshow.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishmaker Simmo from Dunsborough, distributed in IGA stores, and shopkeepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 per cent of Metcash's IGA-Lade stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will snap out around five per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first markets, and will take away all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report published this week, analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, and will achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley is assuming that Metcash's sales in the food and food business are down 3.8 per cent in 2016, down 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, and will reduce the market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGAS's market share has fallen from 18 per cent to 14 per cent since 2010, and income from Metcash's food and grocery store, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction at simultaneous pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler wrestles and invests more than $150 million to align sales prices with Coles and Woolworths at hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh food and delivering a better selection of private-Label food.
Metcash's chief executive, Ian Morrice, says that the price adjustments and shoplifting programs will go to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
