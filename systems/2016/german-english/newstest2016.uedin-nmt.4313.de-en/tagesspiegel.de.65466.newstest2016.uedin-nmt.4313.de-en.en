Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: 'We are creating this'
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What is going on in Germany?
Some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to absorb a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can create this, and we create that."
What is going on in Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) apartments annually - and for the next five years.
That's almost twice as much as previously built (250,000 homes).
As a result, the lack of housing is, above all, affordable rental property: 60 000 to 80 000 social housing starts per year, and this particularly favourable housing will also apply to refugees.
Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the perspective of the Plague Institute: 80 000 social housing should be created annually, and the federal government would have to invest $6.4 billion a year.
The scientists and federal ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, it is estimated that, in the long term, 55 percent of the birds in Germany can be employed.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them in their entry, criticising Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for appreciation in the recording company, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political change: From the work ban on refugees to the recognition of work.
While there used to be a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as residency duty, which limits asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society, partly because of the shortage of skilled labour, there has been a majority view that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly.
A major barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of English.
To date, there has not been a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
The building of networks is therefore, according to Thränhardt, the premier route to work integration.
The Berlin School Board has found that only a few winged parents give their children to the Kitchens, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it's only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of Kita, the administration distributes hand papers in different languages.
Should the need for educators rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialist schools.
In the countries, students without a German language are prepared in welcome classes on the classroom.
But they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stafford of the Berlin School Administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patient studies - the only exception to so far has been Berlin, the interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU), but has now abandoned his stance.
Study willing refugees could facilitate access to the university.
For refugees with a residence permit or acquiescence do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seeker law when they start studying.
The latter, in principle, do not get a BAföG, as they do not fall within the circle of eligible persons.
Patient refugees have so far had to live four years in Germany to be Bafög-eligible, from 1 January 2016, this span reduced to 15 months.
This funding gap must also be closed, however, by Steffen Krach, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get BAföG immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing state church law into a new statehood relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic Welfare Association, which takes care of the newcomers in a professional manner.
Rights also include duties.
In this way, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give it certain control options.
This includes a willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany.
Those who wanted to end such conflicts in Germany "immediately have their right to be here, in Germany, forfeited," he said in Bavarian radio.
He suggested translating the Basic Law to Arabic.
Integration will continue to be an issue for the whole of society in the future.
This will also have to change the majority society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing.
Germany, as a result of European decisions, has been an anti-discrimination agency for a mere decade and a general equality law.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder scene showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have long called for, and for international agreements such as the anti-racism convention of Germany, must become a reality in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees so far, according to medical correspondent Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As for man- power and capacity, we are creating that," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money must be channelled into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery urges all residents to hand out health cards equal to the registry.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And, in the long run, it is highly questionable to eat so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seeker scheme is proposing.
Otherwise, doctors, in particular, create the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are worse off about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctors' practices, interpretation costs would have to be accepted.
However, it would also help many refugees with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
In the case of refugee children, for example, there are considerably more untreated disabilities, and young people are concerned with HIV.
With some of the other symptoms of the disease, German doctors would be able to learn from their training, according to Montgomery.
"Parasite beatings or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect," and as far as the doctors shortage is concerned, the refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and perhaps take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psychologically ill, according to estimates by the Federal Foreign Office (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, president of BPtK.
A recent study by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, heart rashes and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, strong dreadfulness and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can make a request for psychotherapy in the social offices, it usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social authorities, specialist workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
