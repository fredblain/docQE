Rama missing in 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich needs to give up about a month on offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had been complaining about pain earlier in the week.
According to Munich lions, the diagnosis "is expected to take four weeks of forced break."
"This hits us hard, Rama is a heartbreaking loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said athletic director Necat Ayamicn of the "Picture" newspaper, looking at the potential commitment of a unified professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30 years old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The crocodile currently has "the ability to prove his skill."
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training after his brainchild next week.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is scheduled to enter the running training.
Okotie had been injured in the match at Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf (0: 3) in a fierce collision at the head.
Contrary to initial fears, however, he remained without a serious blessur.
