'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youths trained to photographer
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place if you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a not-for-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and earn a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the project's first graduates.
