No diet frenzy - mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often more likely to get away from them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially Saccharose.
Healthy are the exotic fruits anyway: In them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre-stage beta-cartin.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell.
The bowl colour alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet food.
A mango, however, also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It alleviates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf seeds such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and venison.
