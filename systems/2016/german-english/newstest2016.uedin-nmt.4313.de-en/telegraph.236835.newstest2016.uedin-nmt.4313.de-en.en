Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe holds false speech in parliament
MR Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell from a podium down the stairs early in the year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media.
The opening of Parliament was also clouded by allegations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mugabe's address with Buhrott.
Last month, they had ousted him and interrupted him during his speech to the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he reiterated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones, which warned them to disrupt Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the concerned MPs that immunity ends in parliament, and once they leave parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "concerned" about the dangers to politicians.
