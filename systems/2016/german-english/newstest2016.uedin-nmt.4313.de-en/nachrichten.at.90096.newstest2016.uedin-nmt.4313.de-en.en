That Viktor Orbán now sends more Zigthousands to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has made a high official and public opinion of the Hungarian Government's position in the Dunstkreis of Nazism.
As a result of this policy, it is not only the Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The birds, too, will have to find that the "promised land," which she has invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing influx of refugees and the approaching winter, in order to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
