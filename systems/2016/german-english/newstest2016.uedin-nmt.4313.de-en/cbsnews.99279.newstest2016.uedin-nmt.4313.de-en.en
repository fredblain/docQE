Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and ripped off the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, holding all the firm trying to get into the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man's land and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.
The people who fled violence were stranded for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants "opened the border!" and shouted insults against Hungarian riot police.
Some pointed out food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary, while more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution rather than collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the ungarish-Serb border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who took refuge in the overridden Italy and Greece, and they expressed their hope that, next month or until the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include an additional 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special European Union summit on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not put its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbours.
Tuesday's emergency shelter in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis so they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major bottleneck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, and has become the gateway to the European Union.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic migrants who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly at odds with other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4-metre (13 foot) high fence, which the government built along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament must still agree to the military's use of the military, which is expected for next week, but reporters told Associated Press on the border there were heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already seen for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, land security adviser for Orban, said that authorities told 45 people in trying to cross the border, 15 others had already invaded the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, after a train truck collided with barbed wire to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people's data and pressed a crowd to get there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
