Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts at the company's services.
HP will split into two publicly traded companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast-growing corporate hardware and its service business activities.
The expected jobless rate leads to a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new HewPackard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who is to head the unit after the separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of deals that support companies in the transition to a new style of business," Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual sales and "will be focused on providing previously unmet, integrated technology solutions for companies," according to a statement from the company.
It divided a company founded in the 1930" s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and whose Palo Alto garage was called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second-largest PC maker and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that narrowly focused companies provide better performance.
