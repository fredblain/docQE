The lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring Dutch - de Boer

It's because the Rangers are not there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.

They're talking about both teams and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Old-Firm games, and it's not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.

I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel the same - but we must continue.
We really need, really, the support of Celtic, because that makes the players better.
It is so important to come together now.

The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you've seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
