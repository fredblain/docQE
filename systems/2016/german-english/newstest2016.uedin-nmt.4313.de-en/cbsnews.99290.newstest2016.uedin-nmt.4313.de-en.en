Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead ahead of Bernie Sanders in national poll halved
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination nationally, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (rising by 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders posted some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is back here only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with double-digit lead at the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters of the primaries nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their leading candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it's time that a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is also mentioned.
Consent to deal with the problems and electability are also cited.
As the vice president casts a potential for president in the wake, 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries want to see him in the race - although a third believe he should not.
If Democratic voters of the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the helm.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half say that Biden would be their second choice well before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democrats' nomination, Hillary Clinton's edge ahead of Sanders, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most selective" has risen.
Still, on the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about electability.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate, or potential candidate, stands out as unacceptable for these voters.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results on some important traits among voters of their party's primaries.
Majorities regard Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts best among the three candidates in terms of honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say this about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.
Democratic voters of the primaries generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
For all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Given questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during tenure as secretary of state, most Democratic voters of the primaries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on her general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that her opinion of her was still deteriorating.
It's mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters: Only 32 per cent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
Sixty-two percent of eligible voters do not consider them to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as not honest and untrustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut best in honesty.
A majority sees Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
