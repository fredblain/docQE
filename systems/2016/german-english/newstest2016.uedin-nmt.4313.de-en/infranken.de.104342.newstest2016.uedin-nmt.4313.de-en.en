Bath Kissinger's chess club has a prominent member
The chess club "Chess Bad Kissingen," founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, so the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kissing for a cure.
Gauselmann is the bearer of the Federal Treasurer 1st Class and honorary citizens of the cities of Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissing has supported Gauselmann with a donation that chairman Alfred Klein said.
As a result, it is possible to include chess players who cannot muster the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward.
Gauselmann wants to see membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red White" as an expression of his bond with the spa town.
