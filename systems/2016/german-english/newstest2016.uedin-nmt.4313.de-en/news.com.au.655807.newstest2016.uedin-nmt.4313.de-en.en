The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have been unknowingly obvious who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, at whom Sam Wood eventually landed in The bachelorette, was wrapped in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the day before coming out of three two, you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until Thursday's final
All three women have missed out on lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods last rose?" could become their answers to the playoff, who won the heart of the bachelor's.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both fast - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
"From the moment I went to the house and (Sarah) and Sams energies, I noticed that I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on Earth, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the one."
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it became clear to me that this was obviously not just a game - I am now unreserved to him," she said.
And when asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m.
