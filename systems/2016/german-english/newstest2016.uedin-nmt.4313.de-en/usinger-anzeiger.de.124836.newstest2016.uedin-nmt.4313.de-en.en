Hundreds of refugees to be submerged in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people involved are to be housed in temporary shelters in Wiesbaden, such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night.
They estimated 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there.
They will then be distributed to other local authorities.
In the last ten days alone, there were 7500 people arriving in Hesse, according to the Bureau of Governors responsible for the initial shooting.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
