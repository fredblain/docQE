For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with Type 2 diabetes can take at least five years, according to a new study.
It's too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery who wrote a sergeant to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proved efficient, but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease-prone with a body-mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery - stomach ulcers and stomach mud - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained among those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same at 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, 36% solved the diabetes disease completely and at 28%.
In the medical-treated group, in comparison, diabetes only dissolved at one per cent and partly at only about two per cent.
In addition, the results were in the controls of blood pressure, the triglycerides and the "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, average hemoglobin A1c levels fell from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained steady at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as you are reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to veteran researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the guest rectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reaching larger declines in BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was among obese people who underwent an obesity operation, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years -- compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival among the surgeon's patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long before we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they've collected these genetic changes that have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
