How to share your stories, pictures and videos with BBC News
Every day BBC News - on TV, radio and online - bring you the latest stories from around the world, but what we want to hear are the issues that are important to you.
The role you play in creating the news is very important.
Whether it's news or a specific topic, your contribution can make a difference.
Have you seen an event or have you been affected?
Is something important, Bizarres or unusual in your environment?
Do you have a story to tell, or is there something you should follow in your view?
Are there any issues you would like to start talking about?
What do you want to comment?
Or do you want to find out what others are talking about?
