Seehofer: 'Borders are not sealed off'
In an extended telephone call with Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), state principal Josef Pühringer (VP), on Monday, recorded the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off.
The continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic continues to be possible.
However, there are now the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist for the time being.
However, the security seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Of the other member states, Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria, too, introduces controls at its borders, is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
