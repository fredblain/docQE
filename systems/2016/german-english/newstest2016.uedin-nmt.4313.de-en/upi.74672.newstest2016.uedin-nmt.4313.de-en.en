Matt Damon plays diversity in film creation
Matt Damon confrontted the African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown when that emphasized the need for alternative perspectives, in reference to a black protagonist in the project's chosen script.
"When we talk about diversity, you do it at the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show," Damon asserted.
Brown reacted shocked, with insulting disbelief and called "Hoo! WoW. Okay," when the actor's comments rallied from The Martian.
Damon and Brown joined the show's producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
"I want to ask people to think about this - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony," Brown said first.
The only black person, and she's a nutter, beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People campaigned for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the reigning rights to the film; Damon replied that her directing "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded ahead of disapproval over Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip by writing "Matt Damon talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts."
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 Likes since its release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After the teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the movement hit Black Lives Matter nationwide and urged lawmakers and authorities to halt discriminatory practices against Farens.
In February, the singer Prince made an allusion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Album still matt," (albums still have their meaning) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Movement Black Lives Matter have released a statement, in response to the issue of fox-news personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The network Black Lives Matter is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogule who will be invited to visit the pope to discuss the portrayal of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the pope is unclear.
