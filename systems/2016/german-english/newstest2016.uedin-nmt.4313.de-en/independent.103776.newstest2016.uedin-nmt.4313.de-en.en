Ios 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app, typing on "General" and then selecting "Software Update."
If it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message indicating that the "software update failed."
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait for the rush to decline or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself takes you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it less likely to do so by streamlining the update, and it will be easier to do that if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It's worth making sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charging device, so the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to continue, as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could lead to a breakdown of the update.
