Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England team, but it's still hard
Hitting on Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the cadres that England have chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn't rule out an upside.
Alastair Cooks's side may be less experienced than those three years ago, but there are good spin-players in the battle line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they won't wear scars from 2012, just a youthful positive attitude.
With the ball developing Moeen Ali as Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown size at Test level, is an option for the attack.

The decision to leave Adam Lyth is, of course, for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, hard to analyse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on outcomes.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I've said this before - players are their own best selections.
A long time ago, it would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he hopes to make further runs for Yorkshire, there is another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn't perform such good performances, and that doesn't surprise me; he's mainly a team man.
The question of how much time a test drummer gets to set up his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to go home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batting man, whom I value highly.
He's an X Factor cricket player, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those before him, but this, of course, depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of beating Moeen alongside Cook, which would provide an extra spin-off bowler and received four Quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a batter can't beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a vicious circle of cricketer players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop, before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He managed three hundred Runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the cadre as a back-up-spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me as a young man.
People may look at his stats - an average of 31 with the racket and 35 with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there's not a large number of backup spiders who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England have made a couple of smart additions to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master ercoup.
He is one of the nettest guys of the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Collys teammates at Durham, Ben Stokes, will not be used at the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with that.
Some won't agree, but Coaches and team members don't determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that as with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
