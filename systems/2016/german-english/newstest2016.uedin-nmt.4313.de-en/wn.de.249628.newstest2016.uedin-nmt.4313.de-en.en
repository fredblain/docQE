Football: BvB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback by Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League were finally broken.
The national team will also be missing the league leader of the Football League in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m./Sky).
"We unfortunately cannot resort to him," Thomas Tuchel said Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday."
Given the heavy stress of its pros, Tuchel will change its Stammelf not only on the Reus position.
So he announced a switch on the goalkeeper position.
That's why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman BÃ¼rki.
"He trains at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller is used in the future in all Europa League games, however, Tuchel left open.
With high probability, he will also play the second game.
The foray statement by fellow players Reus that the final entrant for the BVB in the Europa League should be the goal, holding midfielder Julian Weigl for understandable: "This is Marco not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to pick up the title."
