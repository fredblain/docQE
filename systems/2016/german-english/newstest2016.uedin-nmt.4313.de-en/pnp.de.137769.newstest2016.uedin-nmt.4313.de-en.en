Twin offspring at gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is excited about offspring at its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twin births are rare among gorillas.
The last in a German zoo was nearly 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet clear, as Mother Dian keeps her tight on the body so far.
First, the "picture" had been reported.
