Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right ball in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this has brought the left field defender to wine and will rule him out for at least six months from playing, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw collapsed into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's horrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it's very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that takes six months and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to escape a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news, words cannot describe how broken I am, my way to recovery starts now, I come back stronger again."

The England defender, with the European Championship in France, has an additional incentive to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When a player leaves the place with this kind of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland-team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very serious injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in a different direction so it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
Talking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad, and I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
