Former footballer Tim Wiese was struck down in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim engaged, wrestler.
He wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass, according to his own statement over the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not admit it.
Meadow left in Bremen's city centre just cut the hair when he saw how outside a park robbery guard put out a criminal record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Meadow then stormed out of the shop, offended the beamer and threw her the overdue fine before the feet, as the "picture" newspaper reports.
At the city of Bremen, the allegations are confirmed, but are not yet aware of the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The thing is still in the exam," the city of Bremen said.
Only after that will determine whether meadow is displayed or not.
