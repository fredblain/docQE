Serbians with $200,000 bail after drug deal
A man who may face a life sentence because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men arrested last month after federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and lodged in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was watched as he met his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at Caf√© Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for trying to own a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the escape danger at Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to police about his whereabouts.
Maksimov's mother and stepfather had offered bail of $200,000 as security together to reach his release.
"After reading the audacious statements of the two people, it is clear that the circulation of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to prevent him from not appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the terms that he made his Australian and his Serbian passport, reported to the police daily, and kept to a curfew at 18: 00-06: 00.
