NHC predicts 60% chance for cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center said Tuesday it predicted a wide low pressure system about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60-percent chance to develop into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low pressure system, for instance in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, adding to the weather experts stationed in Miami.
