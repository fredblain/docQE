Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) is a new medical director at Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is due to the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the Landkreis, the landlady Andrea Jochner-White confirmed.
However, a decision is made by the Supervisory Board, and the meeting will take place next Wednesday, 23 September.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would be employed.
The vast majority should move with fishermen and the nearby station to Schongau.
The rooms are in place.
The staff, who cannot go to Schongau, is to be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-White.
The staff were briefed on the plans.
The change was caused by the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been a medical director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
On the question of who is to succeed, according to Jochner White, the name "Fischer" came into play, who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means, in any case, an "appreciation" and a broadening of the offer in the area of "Internal Medicine," according to Jochner White.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases.
For the next two years, Fischer with his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will lead both houses, until then next year the former hospital of the workforce, which still has more than 35 beds, to be closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.
Until now, the county had planned this for 2018 when the current clean-up at Weilheim hospital has been completed.
Landlady Jochner-White, who is also chairwoman of the supervisory board, joined rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, is to be used as a shelter for asylum seekers in the future.
"I conclude that," as it continues with the property, Jochner White could not say there were several considerations.
At the moment there is a short time care for Caritas and a daily psychiatrics.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," Fischer said about the quasi-move to the Lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the staff.
A real perspective for the house, in which Fischer has worked as a chief medical officer for over 30 years, has not given up.
He was asked by Schongauer's colleagues to take up the post of medical director.
Peißenberg's hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened by closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
