Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The local councillor Bernried approved the construction application for the EUR 2.3 million sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flat for solar panels.
The plans for the long-awaited turnaround construction at the Bernrieder Sports Area are moving forward step by step: In the recent local council meeting, the prepared construction application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had decided, among other things, a request for a construction legal "exemption" from the current development plan.
In the case of the "exception," permission was granted for a special form in relation to roof construction.
Thus, a "saddle-roof with non-common first and roof stand" is to be built.
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar panels: "By doing this we get a wonderfully large southern roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting.
For the sake of "liberation," it was supposed to be among ten degrees, for energetic reasons, other than in the development plan.
The volume of the hall will be significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan for the roof of the roof does not allow for "exceptions" - with the Bernrieder council usually more restrictive in the case of libertarians.
At Turnbull building, however, it is not a recurring project: "We don't create a precedent," according to Steigenberger.
The gym building at the sports centre is a joint project of the community and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are calculated at a cost.
Grants are expected from school and grassroots sports support.
In the next step of the procedure, the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will now be submitted to the Landratet for examination.
