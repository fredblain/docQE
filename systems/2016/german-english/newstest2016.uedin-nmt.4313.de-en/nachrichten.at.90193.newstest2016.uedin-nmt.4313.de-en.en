Lia-Peroni-holder opened second business in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla-handbags are at the centre.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
This project had to be curled up by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the dog-market arcade: After all, she has now gained an increase in the form of another business local.
At the Furla-Shop opposite the business in which it sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from different manufacturers, it is now all about women's handbags of the Furla brand, money markets are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It has been rebuilt for several weeks.
"I have long considered, however, whether I should still open a store," says Breit.
The key to the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are at home in Bologna, were taken away from the idea of their own location, where only their handbags were sold.
"We are the only ones in the greater Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who himself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has received Breit from her mother in the cradle.
I get the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some women find themselves at the sight of a nice handbag in adornment, the specialist woman cannot answer with the last safety.
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit looks up.
