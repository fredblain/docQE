Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the UK overall.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 per cent was above the UK's 5.5 per cent, as figures from the Office for National Statistics (ons) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent during the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK.
In those 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
