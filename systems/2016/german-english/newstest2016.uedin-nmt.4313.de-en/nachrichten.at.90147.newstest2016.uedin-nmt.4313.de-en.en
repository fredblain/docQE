The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New shipyard" in the Linzer industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT Group S & T is drawn, the rest (2700 square feet) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S & T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup-companies of the New Shipyard, and later on how to invest.
From the very beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Niederhauser is promising: "The next runtastic is just a matter of time."
EUR 1.7 million were invested by S & T in the location, EUR 3.3 million from the TechCenter, which belongs to a third of the city of Linz, the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government (FFG).
The building is leased from Linz AG for 60 years to S & T as well as TechCenter.
Thirty per cent of the 2700 square feet of residual space in the building are already rented, for a further 40 per cent there are inquiries.
