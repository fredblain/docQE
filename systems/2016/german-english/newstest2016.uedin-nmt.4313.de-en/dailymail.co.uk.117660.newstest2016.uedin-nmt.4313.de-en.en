Muslims buried in Mecca at crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mecca through the streets
Saudi Arabia settles the collapse in part of the giant Saudic Bin-Ladel group
The Department of Health said that, in addition, a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the ones who were killed when a crane collapsed at Mekka's big moshee.
Mourners filled, largely dressed in white, the track to pay their respects when the first of the dead joined their last trip to the Al-Moaissem-cemetery.
The funeral procession moved past the Holy See, where only days before a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then to the bedside.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the building company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 mourners who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mozhee Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was assisted.
MR Akram was with his parents before the start of the annual Haddsh in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officials have already agreed that the Haddsh will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today, King Salman said the Bin-Ladel group should not have stood the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the state Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin-Ladel Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the company's leadership was banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the big mozhee, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Haddsh, which takes place later this month.
The Bin-Ladel Group did not issue statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also tamed the group because of non-current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of crows surrounded Mekka's big moshee as part of the massive construction project headed by the Bin-Ladel Group.
The Bin Laden family has been affiliated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on larger construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a breakaway son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crane's crash came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rial (Â£174,000) to be paid to the families of those killed and the same amount of permanent casualties.
Other injuries get half that amount.
