The Brulljesmaker from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose residents are called solicitors.
This property also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he expresses xenophobic, journalists are concerned about or knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency is cracking down on the campaign.
And performs well.
This is also registered in the bearded Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the conciliatory is many in the Winzerdorf on the wine road.
Some in the 1200-square-foot place is over -ten corners with him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Kalltown's Simone Wendel turned a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think this is somehow exciting, but they are not so impressed in their Kallstadter style," says Simone Wendel.
The native Kalltown has filmed an amusing documentary about the place and its famous sprinters, to which alongside Trump also counts the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, is also coming to terms in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he were to live in Kallstadt.
To the king of hearts, he didn't bring it there.
While there is respect for the family's performance, they also tend to believe that Trump is "already a bit of a big maul," Wendel says.
Coincidentally loud the nickname, the Kallstadt in the perimeter, "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: The Angers, she says.
So Trump is coming out of the village of the solicitors.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a restaurant for gold diggers in the US.
Foundations of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York.
But the lives of the grandparents were not free of tragedy: Their desire to return to the homeland in the long term failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump because he was once held off without a permit, the director of the Institute for Forgotten History and Folk, Roland Paul, said at the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an "illegal immigrant."
This contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descendant.
It had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Like the pole, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trumps ("The grandma was a born Trump, the grandpa was born Heinz").
The grower, in retirement, looks more distanced from the Americans, "he's always so upbeat."
Does he think Trump is coming?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never bothered about Kallstadt."
The pension owner Veronika Schramm, like some Kallstadter, mentioned that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something to the church organ during a visit, which is generally good.
"I can't imagine that from Donald," the 68-year-old says.
It would be better if he did not contest the election, because "who has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him, "he would never have arrived there."
"There are more interesting issues than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"My president isn't," she says.
And, "the grapes will also be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendel's film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12 000 cinematographers, including in the US wakes up interest.
