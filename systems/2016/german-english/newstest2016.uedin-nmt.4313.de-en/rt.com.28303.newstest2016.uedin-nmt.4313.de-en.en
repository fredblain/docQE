"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not include all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, but the situation was not appropriate.
"It's impossible that everyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to address the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime, you have to think about long-term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, to be created for these Muslim countries," he insisted.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce the killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence, and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack on Sept. 11 and turned out that the U.S. 's violent response drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
