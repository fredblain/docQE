Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as Tehran's destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
At the meeting, however, it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that is being discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction, accusing Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
Through the deal brokered by Obama over Iran's nuclear program, the relationship between the two has deteriorated further.
In March, Netanyahu, at the invitation of Republicans before the U.S. Congress, delivered a controversial speech that was partly regarded as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel.
