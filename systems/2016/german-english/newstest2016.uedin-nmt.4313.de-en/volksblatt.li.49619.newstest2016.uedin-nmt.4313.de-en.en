The US package service UPS offers up to 95,000 assists for the Christmas business in the United States.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said Tuesday.
In particular, drivers are being sought.
Last year, UPS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 assists.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor, FedEx, have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, late deliveries brought the package services harrowing criticism.
