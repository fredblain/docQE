Xavi: PEP Guardiola prevented from switching to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
The FC Bayern clearly stood a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champions, three times postseason winners, four times Champions League winners, two times club champions, two times European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is staggering.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now reveals he was already ahead of Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona.
"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we did nothing," he tells me.
And that also registered the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted to have me."
Remember: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn't switch
The change, however, did not materialise.
And the decisive man for this today works for the German record master: PEP Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has taken Guardiola under contract and I've played a great EM."
"PEP told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"With that, he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's 2008/2009 season would have run with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, snapped the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated the premier league triumph at the end.
