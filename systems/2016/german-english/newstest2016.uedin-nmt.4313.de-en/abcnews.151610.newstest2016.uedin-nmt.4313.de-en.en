UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia's enhanced military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five years of conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council's five permanent member nations - US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions in the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation intractable."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria, which they have demonstrated in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
