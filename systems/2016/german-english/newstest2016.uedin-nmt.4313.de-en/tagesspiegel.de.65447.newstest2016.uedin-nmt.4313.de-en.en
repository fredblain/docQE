JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square feet of cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court granted an ex-detainee to the law enforcement agency Tegel, which had been housed in a small cell for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are basically entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday.
According to the judges, they can even hope for money if only a few days were locked up in the confined spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
As a result, an ex-detainee with his constitutional credentials was successful in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with around five square feet of ground floor between June and November 2009, and the toilet was not separated.
After that, the man who is now back at large, according to his lawyer, has been moved to a larger cell.
His oath of office, because of the indecent prison conditions against the country of Berlin, failed.
But the constitutional judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court, rejecting the case for re-examination.
You see the man's human dignity being violated.
Chamber court now decides on level of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, the period in question was only a few days jail days for compensation, compensation was given, it was said.
Otherwise, "a clergyman of legal protection would be to fear the personality."
The chamber court now needs to clarify the amount of money.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they spoke only in April to a detainee compensation because he was naked in a cell.
Degrading, according to a 2011 decision, also the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet.
In addition, on Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had documented a detainee in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then-plaintiff was hospitalized for three months every day between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
Berlin's prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of missing staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly trapped for 23 hours, the aggressiveness is rising, even thugs are supposed to have arrived because of the tense situation.
According to the Department of Justice, 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied due to the lack of young people, 19 are due to disappear in 2016.
