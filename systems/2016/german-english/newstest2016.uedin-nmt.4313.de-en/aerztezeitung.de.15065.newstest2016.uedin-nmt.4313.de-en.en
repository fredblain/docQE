Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth
Those who smoke will harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In the case of abandonment, the risk falls quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is based on the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were at risk of losing their teeth prematurely, hitting the 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gum, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, emphasize the authors.
So the link between smoking and tooth decay is due to more frequent gum infections in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk for caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years to put the risk back to the level of non-smokers, explained Erdutor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be persuaded to become non-smokers, study leader Heiner Boeing told DIfE: "Smoking is shortening the lifetime."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health to the high age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population ages 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study underpins the findings.
