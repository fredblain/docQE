Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy strikes back against rivals over claims to ring fight
Melbourne-Storm-coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players' tackling as an "Agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the umpires allowed the storm-fielding players to play "ring battles" with his team during the High Storm rally in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a barely veiled note to the storm-team after his team scored the Final-Sieg against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "model example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said they were focused only on their "contact" at Tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism from two leading coaches on his team gave him confidence, as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the storm-team.
"That keeps coming up - I didn't hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when they beat us 24: 2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided the turnaround for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train, so he is probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how this time to come back to this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticised as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of a cockrower.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit concerned about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS scored a higher score than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was probably a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more tries in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are breaks, and no points, a bit of tension?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we are still going to meet them at one stage.
The storm-team has been free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the preseason finals at AAMI Park, with ticket sales starting next Tuesday morning.
