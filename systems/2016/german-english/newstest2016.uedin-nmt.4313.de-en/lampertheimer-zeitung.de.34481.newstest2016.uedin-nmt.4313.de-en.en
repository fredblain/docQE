Ecumenical Hospice Relief Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is non-stop operation around the Mannheimer Exhibition Centre.
People do their concerns, sometimes fast paces, partially cozy bumbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalons at the venue.
Keep city streets.
Pulsating, prall life at wonderful autumn solstice and mittens four large plates each with the headline "Bevor I die I want to be."
The Ecumenical hospitalization, with this action, drew attention to its 20-year existence and is certainly facing mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we've gone with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Relief is available to the passers-by as well as to questions and talks, such as the volunteers.
While some prefer a passer-by spontaneously to chalk up, "read the phrase "my life," "with the camper going through the United States," "to stop the war" or "not suffer for a long time," others remain short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
Time and again, on the sidelines, there are small discussions about the action itself, about life, how to deal with the dying.
Even Peter Hübinger is just on the spot.
"Just when I make it clear that for me to end up coming to the end of this world, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic Works of Mannheim, which is jointly with the Caritas-based Association of Ecumenical Hospital Assistance.
Therefore, this high-profile action on 20-year-olds is good.
The fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards is understandable, after all, it is a very personal thing.
The subject of death and dying is still littered with taboos, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to people opening up.
An assessment that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and funeral companion is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour.
Confronted by personal experience with the subject, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical hospitalization was sought by calling volunteers, they immediately reported and had been involved in the creation in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and loved ones in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the hospice of St Vincent.
All of them are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can do well with her job and his experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another warty, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the outpatient Öcumenian hospice service is free of charge and confessional.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from families and associations enables the training as well as training and supervisions of the dying and funeral attendants.
Every two years we offer training for new employees.
The panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal wishes can also be noted on postcards.
