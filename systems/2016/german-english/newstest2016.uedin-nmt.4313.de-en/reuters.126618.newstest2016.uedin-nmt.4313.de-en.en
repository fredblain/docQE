Google launches doubling donor campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach in announcing the donor call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, was talking about her personal experiences.
"To our trip there were many dark rail and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four charities providing assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to google.com/divestment to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee from war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
