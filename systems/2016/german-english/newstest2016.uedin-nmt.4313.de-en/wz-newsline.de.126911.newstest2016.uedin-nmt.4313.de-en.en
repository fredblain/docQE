Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It's a mix of very big fashion show and a wax figurehead: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: Storefront pucks, which are alarmingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the French designer's spectacular creations, among others, with Madonnas stage outfits to the great star of the fashion scene - and thus that he put men in skirts.
"I can't say today that I'm the Enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"Before it was tanned, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From the Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the pavement on the catwalk), which can be seen from 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his first negative attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is a superbly choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort was done: To frisk the dolls, for example, a stylist was dedicated.
14 tons of material have been mated by the makers, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Just before the start of the October festival there was a special treat: A leather chair outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old teddy is also seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the designer's first, tentative fashionable walking attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he was attracted to his teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
With a doll to play, his parents would not have allowed him.
Throwing fashion, he later confessed himself to himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier said in Munich.
Later, however, I bought it, then, of course.
For his first own fashion show, he has not been able to pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clams.
