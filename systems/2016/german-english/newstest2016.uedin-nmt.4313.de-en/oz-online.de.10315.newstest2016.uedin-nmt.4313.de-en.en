Construction site planned in the city
The property at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000-square-foot surface.
What is planned is a mix of trade, trade and housing - concrete offers are not yet available.
Emden - The town of Emden wants to promote a 4000 square metre plot in direct neighbourhood to the Alte Post youth centre.
Preparations are currently under way.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of trade, trade and housing.
We are waiting for special offers, that is to say on the part of the city.
The investor in question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded.
The town of Emden had bought part of the plot, which lies on the ring road/corner of Great Street, just a few months ago, and to tear down the building.
