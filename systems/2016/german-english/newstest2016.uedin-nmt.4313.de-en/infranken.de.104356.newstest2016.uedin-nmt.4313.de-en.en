District attorney's office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Altenzentrum Antonistift have joined together under the mantle of the Social Foundation and opened a new one-stop shop at Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
In addition to consultation, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
To be more precise, at the Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new district office has recently been opened.
Here, right next to the purchasing market, from now on, seniors and council members receive information on issues such as care insurance or services of sick and nursing homes.
For years we have been using our outpatient care service to ensure that carers are left alone.
There are an infinite number of questions.
"Also, not often many benefits of the coffers are not used, because the complexity of the insurance industry is barely understood," explained the new housekeeper Jutta Weigand, who as a business division manager for AltenAid is also responsible for the Antonista and Citizens Hospital, as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus."
In addition to the consultations, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
To this end, the Saludis was taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as storm prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and rehab.
"The senior center for care and care," explained Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change.
This makes a good decentralised infrastructure in the individual parts of Bamberg in the future indispensable.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underscored the opening ceremonies, dedicating the district attorney's office to the age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular sociable get-together."
In doing so, the Social Foundation makes a major contribution to ensuring that seniors can live as independently as possible and well in their familiar environment.
The district attorney's office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
