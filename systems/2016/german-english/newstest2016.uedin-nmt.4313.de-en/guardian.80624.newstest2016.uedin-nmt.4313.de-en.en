'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how nematodes change direction at the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that have high frequencies for human hearing.
The impulses work by switching Motoneuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.

The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fade worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when surrounded by a fluid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the seasoning cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
If he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microblows and transferred to the worms where they turn the modified Motoneurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to switch neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent down to an optical fibre to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue freely and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells, he added.
