Refugees need shelter: Study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are seeking an affordable lead.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution campaigns in the German housing market have long since begun.
With the coming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable homes.
To meet demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the association of "social-housing."
By comparison, this year, 260,000 units are ready in Germany.
As a result, 140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence.
Many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long snakes in front of the rental flats.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising numbers of refugees.
The study also makes significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit, which is increasing from year to year.
Currently, some 77,000 accommodation units have already been missing in the conurbations, complains Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study.
Many professionals lived in WG rooms in large cities.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the slack in the housing market.
In the big cities, the number of square feet per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the alliance "Social Housing" suggests a reboot.
In doing so, new incentives are expected to boost social housing.
Thus, the basic income tax could be waived and the land tax for subsidised homes will be suspended.
Moreover, according to the Alliance, attractive tax incentives are needed.
The funding programme for refugee accommodation of the state bank KfW is already doing well in towns and cities.
A good week after it was launched on Monday evening with EUR 184 million, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had been called up.
Now, the project could even be topped up.
