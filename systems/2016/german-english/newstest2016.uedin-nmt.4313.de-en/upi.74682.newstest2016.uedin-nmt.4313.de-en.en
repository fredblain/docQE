'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first champion
Professional sports climbers and operating guide Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took the grand prize of $1 million with home.
The Competition Show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competitive participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the finals.
To the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhausting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed that challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-won victory, still under the shock of winning the Great Price of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or been alive," said Isaac E! About his pile of money.
So all of a sudden... as I can't even imagine how that is, the future is unknown.
The senior producer, Kent Weed, sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first ever to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there are more than one finalists, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much the money is a wonderful price and changes life, it gets the great gratification.
I don't think he has any grudge about that.
He's just so happy to have done what he's done.
Crowds of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family friend.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had swapped the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an Eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
