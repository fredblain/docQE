Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner is building terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
For example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need living room, but also the mother and the low paid."
"I show how you can still build good and well today," the 44-year-old says in interview
Thousands of refugees will push into the housing market.
The entrepreneur, Markus Gildner, is believed to know how quickly living space can be created: He is building terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay to a large part here.
Given the flow of refugees, we also need enough housing in the next few decades.
A completely banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least place.
It facilitates integration.
That's different when you're letting people down in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses currently built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 square feet of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That is manageable.
The construction lasted six months.
That is reasonable.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: I have mastered my project correctly.
It is particularly difficult to find the threat of Damoklessch special construction and the location regulation.
Grinning.
It is still subject to who in a terraced house creates three flats, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities there is no room for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents react to their terraced home project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But do you not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True, we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years, but built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message, even ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low paid.
I show how to build cheap and well today.
That is what it is all about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
