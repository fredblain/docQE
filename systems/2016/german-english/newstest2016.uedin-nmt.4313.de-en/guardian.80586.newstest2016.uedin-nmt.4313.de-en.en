BBC should abandon Eastenders, says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop sending programs like Eastenders and The Voice, saying that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK-Sones.
He criticised the BBC for making public programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard-pressed time windows against the most popular shows by their rivals and by broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC director-general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he spent six years in his time at Channel 4 without success trying to come into contact with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or broadcast that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the Upper House Communications Committee in his inquiry on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, it should at least be based on programmes that others do not make or mandate.
They send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax program is funded, which could also be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, Eastenders is another, admittedly both in-house productions.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I am trying to see how this should be public-law television.
I don't think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who chaired Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the hunt for valuations "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts give this back to what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows such as Eastenders.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience pretty much, but they are fulfilling their tasks, and they can argue that if they go on their seeming missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that nobody has seen."
They put them in a window of opportunity in which no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio charge, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think you get a big value for £150 a year here, but for people who are for the £150m a lot of money, I wonder if that's true, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky- and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain."
He said that little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 per cent of its TV production and 0.1 per cent on the radio - and it should set an example to public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this in "inform, enlighten and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful are shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
