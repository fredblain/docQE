The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the U.S. at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi's first official in Washington, will take place on 25 September and extort President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host hosts of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two state leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide the opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of dissent," adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about China's alleged cyberespionage and its increasing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
