8 poll results showing that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the top ranks at polls down, it (still) didn't work.
Ten of the last 11 national polls showed Donald Trump in the double-digit lead, and some are starting to get serious about what it means for the odds of the Real Estate's nomination.
Of course, it is too early in the parliamentary term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the rising Herman Cain, none of which won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps staying power and starting to let their dollars flow to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers suggesting that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trumps's approval ratings have turned around 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth-University showed that only two out of 10 Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers keep in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP-voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "thrilled" or "satisfied" if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if Jeb Bush, the establishment's favorite, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trumps temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and abusive statements, 52 percent of the Republican-leaning Irish voters believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure applies in the nation's first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to effectively execute his office, and nearly six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not fit into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they set up their erudition, Republican voters hold Trump for real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of 10 at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP-voters have not had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination against just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Still, it is apparent that a variety of GOP-led voters see Trumps's campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost anyone.
Some experts point out that the fractured field is likely to contribute to Trumps' leadership, while anti-gun support is difficile to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a poll by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina's 13 points, ahead of Marco Rubio's 14 points, before Walker scored 15 points, before Jeb Bush scored 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their minds.
A new poll by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have their voices fixed.
Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
Forty-six percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trumps is strongest competition at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapist" in his election campaign two months ago, immigration was pivotal in public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombastic expression of Trump's crucial Hispanic-Americans will be kept away by the Republican Party and will damage the reorient efforts.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they are consistent with Trump on immigration issues.
So long as immigration remains in the limelight, Donald Trump seems to be doing it, too.
Frustration over the government clings to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson, meanwhile, around half the support of Republican voters, mainly through their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they'd rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa-Republians are frustrated by Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellish angry."
