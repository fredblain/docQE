Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior, Johanna Mikltiktner, stated on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF, that no one will be returned to Hungary.
Germany, too, did not return refugees to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she explained.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikltiktner said that there had already been discussions between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so-called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU leaders, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls.
The EU countries have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
The EU's interior ministers want to take a fresh start to the mandatory distribution of another 120 000 refugees next Tuesday (22 September) at a special meeting.
Given the strong refugee status in Germany, the federal government wants to give more support to countries in the initial acquisition and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this jointly with the countries, announced by Merkel late Tuesday night after nearly four-hour deliberations with the prime ministers at the chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would receive it.
But if you don't have a lead perspective, you cannot stay in Germany.
This view was summed up in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a "huge effort."
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175 kilometer long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also shut down the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking evasive routes over Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the proposed new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were initial arrests of people who had cut the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, eyewitness accounts said that thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
