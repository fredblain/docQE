Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads shameful Britain's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Messenger video watch.
Terrible mob drones!
Footballing shattered blizzards!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause agonizing pain but leave no trace!
The happy voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's biggest arms trade fair is a combative parody, produced by Amnesty International, to lobby the British government's willingness to put weapons to repressive regimes over the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and on the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) reads in the font types of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLRLine, which converts to the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will ask customers to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the museum for gruesome designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective with the name Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a Â£6 pack from Inbusturnkey, which claims that "access to around a third of bus station advertising space on the planet."
Transport for London finds this poster "vandalism" not funny.

After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to move outside to the real world so that their art has an impact on society.

The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works non-profit with the graphic designer and Voiceover artist who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that reigned around advertising for the arms trade fair - through a vacancy of the ExCeL-calendar - and thought: "give them the campaign they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic shady corporate advertisement, but "through the concussion with bright colors and animation, it stays stronger."
"They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal resale devices at the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture equipment is not acting illegally on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors are scouring fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army over "the AT4CS RS."
This includes a "uniquely formed battlefield head that delivers outstanding follow-up effects inside the target."
Whatever it does, it will not be pleasant.
