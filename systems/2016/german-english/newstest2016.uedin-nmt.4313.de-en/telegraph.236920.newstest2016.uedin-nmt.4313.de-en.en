FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his involvement next summer at the European Championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame on this current problem is that Wilshere had finished strong last season after a separate ankle injury and then recovered to his old swing during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury doesn't threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that doesn't heal well.
This is not a bigger issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in touch with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It is also developing an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Hospital Ltd recorded 23 different conditions of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08, which has recorded the most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in the injury rate will continue during last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a prospective period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilises, I'm confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger faces a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, meaning that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, passing through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was struck by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal have drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked out at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
