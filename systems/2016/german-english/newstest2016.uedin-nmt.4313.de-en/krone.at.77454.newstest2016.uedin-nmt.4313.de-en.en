Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly providing insight into yet unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire.
With the exploited information, insider trades should have been made in financial markets.
That way, investigators totaled more than $100 million.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our borders will eventually be caught," the SEC statement said.
The trials against 32 other defendants in the case were ongoing.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are supposed to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe.
