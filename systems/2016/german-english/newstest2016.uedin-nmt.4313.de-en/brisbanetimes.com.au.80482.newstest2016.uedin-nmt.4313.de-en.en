Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by the president of Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came under the spotlight by the infamous clash of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon afterward, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison called out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios and I should beat the kid."
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis bat after a cramp failed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth to take second place in the singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis-Cup semi-final against Britain.
"One thing about which I'm quite concerned about it is the fact that after I think Thanasi was drawn a little into the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racket when he lost because of a cramp in the US Open, but he is not the first player to have broken a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the U.S. Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He's got a great team around, he's got a great family around, and I think he's been treated a little too strictly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room, he's trained hard, he's good in form, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the important preliminary decision, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he secures the man from Canberra as a long-term fixture to return to the team."
"First, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversies surrounding [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think that, in the eyes of the people like Federer and Murray, he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions, some time outside the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
