EU seeks to double mercury limit in predator fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predators and give consumers a much higher dose of nerve.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, strongly criticised the plans: "Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed with full force to pregnant women and infants," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limits of the nerve agent for large fish are to be raised at the end of the food chain such as shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, major predators are already so heavily burdened with mercury that about 50 per cent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the existing limit values.
After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 per cent would be unsettled.
In exchange for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limits on other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch, however, called this "trick" because smaller gravefish, such as carp are mostly so low, that they are already meeting the planned highs today.
The reduction in small numbers is therefore "a perfidious distraction that helps the economy alone," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which spreads heavily over the food chain, especially in predators.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small quantities can be particularly caused by unborn skulls of the nervous system."
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, on its website with regard to current levels, says that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury is mainly due to coal burning into the environment.
According to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal-fired power plants have more than six tonnes of mercury in the year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example, in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube, was "permanently and comprehensively crossed," the "Mirror" was quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings against mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
