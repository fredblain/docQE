Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea.
In the street, a square meter of a rectory house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," said the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student bude in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany's top residents, one of the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square metres prices at sky-high altitudes.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square metre, of course.
But, well, who can afford it
By the way: Munich, for once, is not at the top.
