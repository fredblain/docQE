Five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Baruch college newcomer
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual of a student compound in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York-based Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi-Brulik attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction session in September 2013 brutally and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was charged with linked eyes with a 30-pound replica of sand filled with sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field on a target.
Mr. Deng eventually complained about headaches, then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi-DeltaPsi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to police.
However, they had the time to switch Dengs's clothing, his symptoms to goose and Andy Meng to contact the Brotherhood's national president to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, members began to hide Utensilien and put the welfare of the Brotherhood fundamentally over that of Michael Deng," police chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to head, hull and thigh.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood... at least one student has been dying of harassment since 1970 every year," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Bruising and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of murder third-graders for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of bullying and forming a criminal association.
"We don't just want to blame the people involved, but if there is an organization that - officially or inofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national Brotherhood has revoked its affiliation with the local group.
