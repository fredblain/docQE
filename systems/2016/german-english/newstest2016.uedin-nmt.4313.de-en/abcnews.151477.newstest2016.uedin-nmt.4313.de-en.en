In an emergency call, Professor admits to having his girlfriend shot
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told a slightly scratchy voice of police that he shot his girlfriend and that officers would have to come to his house.
Lamb was important to stress that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officers found the corpse of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was glued to a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me," which was in the letter, according to the authorities, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university employees heard the shooting at 10: 18 p.m.
He said that Lamb made the fatal distress call sometime afterwards.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took life when police raided him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what Lamb motivated.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were freaking out on his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teaching includes 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some incumbents to problematic behavior.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little upset and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb told him he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for an assessment on health grounds, saying that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
The latest changes in the university's employment policy meant that the promotion, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not give him a guarantee of an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lambs's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After fleeing from campus, police later found Lambs lane when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car still ran in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 residents and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted away when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate from a marriage.
They had a dog called Lightning, who lived with them in the Backstein house, bordering on a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was OK.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both appeared on a summer vintage market three years ago.
Later, they played together the one or another Gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a Barker and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night on the night of September 5 for the last time, after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonicaspiel finished in front of a sparse crowd.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were on cleaning up and joking at each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of joke.
Schmidt, the dead professor, directed the first semester training program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community attended a candlelight commemoration.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and his brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the memorial station, while the University-schor "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to move our students to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that lamb in his emergency call Prentiss was called his wife, but there was no indication that the two were ever married.
