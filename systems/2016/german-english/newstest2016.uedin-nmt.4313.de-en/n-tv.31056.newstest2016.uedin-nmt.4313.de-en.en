Refugees have free money: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary there is virtually no passing, as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia.
Zagreb announces that there will be no hurdles to travel across Slovenia to the north.
The route is dangerous, however.
Croatia wants to agree with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I spoke to the Slovenian interior minister, and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
Following the isolation of the Serbian Hungarian border, there are hundreds of refugees left to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe.
500 people have come across the border at Tovarnik, the Croatian television channel RTL reports.
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees on the previous day.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic explained: "You can go through and we are preparing for that possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, it is people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring Croatia.
Most were media reports from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came with both the bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia.
On the Croatian border, the refugees do not cross border fences.
There are other dangers for this: There are still sharp mines from the Yugoslavian civil war in the 1990s.
Mine cleaners are now expected to quickly create a safe passage.
After Hungary, however, after the closure of the border, there are little more refugees.
On Tuesday, police counted 366 recorded people.
Just before Torture on Monday, it was still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws include overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
35 criminal proceedings have therefore been initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted face sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received in the newly established "transseat zones" on Tuesday, almost all of them - 93 - of the most important passage of Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, there were still 40 refugees there.
In practice, however, no one has any prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungarian opinion, Serbia is a "safe third country."
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the rubbish that left tens of thousands of people on the roadside in recent weeks.
Barricades have been dismantled and one of the reception centres in the border area has been rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the aim of this restructuring.
Austria has only a few refugees following the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also reinforced its border controls.
As a result, the 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to government figures.
In Salzburg, about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was halted in the morning on the orders of German authorities.
On a regular basis, smaller groups of refugees have been found on foot.
