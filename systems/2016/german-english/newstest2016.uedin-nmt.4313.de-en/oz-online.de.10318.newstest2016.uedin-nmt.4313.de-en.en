Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday settlement of the Small Sea at Emden take shape.
The investor first unveiled public plans for the project.
A number of residents are still worried - they fear the sellout of their recreational fugitives
For months, behind closed doors had been negotiated, grated, debated and drawn.
Now, the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are near Emden on the table.
The interested, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau," presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Emder Council.
Originally, this point had been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDA group that preached the investors and the administration, Ralf Behrend of the System-Bau-management board went on the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it's good to be able to meet all the rumors now.
The project, which is around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called the images and new details to the desired hotel building.
Roberto Schulz, Meerbust's owner and board member at the advocacy group's advocacy group, Pro Hieve, is suing: "This is going to be a giant clotting that surprised everyone else."
He also fears like many other project critics that traffic by the intended size of the plant would increase sharply: "There must be full bus charges so that it expects," according to Schulz
However, what is happening on the good one hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is still no operator.
"First we have to have a coherent concept," said Ralf Behrend.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
