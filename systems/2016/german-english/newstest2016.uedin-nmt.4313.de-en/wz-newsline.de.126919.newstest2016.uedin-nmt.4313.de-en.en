Jewellery rather than Gardine - chatter top as fashion niche
It used to be on the long embroidery machines in and around talking about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, for example, to distribute them to blankets and curtains.
This alone does not work anymore, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespenter.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the talking tip, fashion played a bigger role, then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions some examples: Tip in jewelry, with accessories like bags and in regional costumes.
At all, the so-called vintage fashion, which appeals to past Stilepochen, is an increase in order potential.
Those who do not use niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Together with nine other companies, Modespende is a member of the industry association of Plauener Top and Stickereien.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
Some 80 per cent of sales have been broken in the last 15 years.
Private trade deals, as well as the wholesale trade, almost no longer exist.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
The bulk goods are made much cheaper in Asia today and almost exclusively distributed via chains.
Moreover, exports are weakening, according to Russia and the US.
So there are enough reasons for new paths.
The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer explains from the Stickperle in Falkenstein: "Since this year we have been conducting a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable."
Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg outsider of the Westphalian University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroideries and tips.
To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
There is an area of tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that, above all, have to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often slightly different to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball.
In some places, the machine stifles small kisses.
The chatter goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krough was inspired by this: "Before, I couldn't do anything with traditional chatter."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, she shapes the pattern in silver.
"A lot of people in the region identify with the subject of talking tip - young and old," Reuter says.
It also supplies to the U.S., to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in chat and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
With that, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the talking tip.
