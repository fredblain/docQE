Boll says team and doubles start at table tennis championships
Düsseldorf wants to win the title battle from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision is to fall no later than 22 September.
"This is a huge loss for our team."
"The guys experienced it in the morning."
"We are strong enough, even without Timo to get the title," said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the EMC course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was on the flight to a long-term agreed sponsorship deal in China.
The 34 year-old German master is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite now," stated individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the betting list in Jekaterinburg, also recalled the Euro 2013 in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was also missing, and we've become European champion."
"We should be guided by this," declared the world number one.
