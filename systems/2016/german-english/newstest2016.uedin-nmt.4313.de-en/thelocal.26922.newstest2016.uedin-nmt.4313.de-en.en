Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The mining giant Glencore, based in Switzerland, which is hit by one-day commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt-reduction plan.
London registered company Glencore said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about Â£1.6 billion to pay off its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China's economic downturn hits demand and wreaks havoc on markets.

The stock jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of the broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings to 125 pence per share, representing a 2.4-percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about long-term depressed growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodity prices have dropped by 20 to 40 percent.
