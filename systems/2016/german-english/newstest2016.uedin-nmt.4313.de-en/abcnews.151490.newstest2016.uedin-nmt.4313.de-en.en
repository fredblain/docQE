Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won't hire as many Christmas Day staff as last year, but the toy and baby product retailer says it will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will begin application talks this month and increase staff numbers from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is moving closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, send and deliver products.
