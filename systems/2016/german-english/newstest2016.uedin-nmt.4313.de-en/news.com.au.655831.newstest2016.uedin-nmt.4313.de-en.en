Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after its move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent questions after its impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomatoes and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a straight game as it did to the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Convertit at his first Punt-Return on Tuesday at the 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomatoes trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt-Return and also into the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomatoes continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Rather than grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomatoes also boosted Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patchy catch and take care of the next game.

It was certainly not the start that Hayne and his massive Australian entourage had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch after the fumble fluke and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn't imagine a worse start to his NFL career
"That was a thing that happens now, you just take care of the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the lumber with his Origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass in his own in-goal range led to a Try for Queensland.
Overall, however, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and post it on his Instagram.
