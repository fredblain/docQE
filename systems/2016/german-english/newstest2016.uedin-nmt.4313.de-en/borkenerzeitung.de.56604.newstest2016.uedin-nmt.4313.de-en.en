Pegida poster puts Lebanese on potato döner idea
Potatoes or döner?
It goes both - in the potato döner, developed by the Oldenburger snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase "potato rather than döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay potato and meat put together on a stick.
On the idea, he brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of döner," which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, there has been a barbecue in his shop, which is equipped with meat and potatoes.
"This is Multikulti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been written by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a utility model, according to the authority.
So, how much meat and how much potatoes the cronies contain, Alhay does not want to betray them.
Just so much: "It tastes better together," he finds.
The culinary international understanding is also good for its customers.
