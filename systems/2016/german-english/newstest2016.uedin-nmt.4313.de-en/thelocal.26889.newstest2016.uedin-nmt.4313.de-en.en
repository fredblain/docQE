Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to advance to Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course when Paris Saint-Germain launched its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after starting his Champions League debut as PSG player, who launched the French champions, but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cavani scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualifying for the knock-out passes, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But, while they got the points, it was not a classic game of Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of the gate, and he was replaced later in the game against his home city team and against the club with whom he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2: 0 to cause our opponents to cause problems and look relaxed, even if there are certain things we need to be perfecting over the course of the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the PD team that could hold a 2-2 draw at their own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was ousted by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wingman has been described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he hinted at why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis's pass behind the team's defence, before he finished off to Johan Wiland, he finished off nicely in the long corner of the net.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would get a big win, that was disappointing.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a playoff to reach that stage, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and, with a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield, pitched a difficult opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed wide to Kevin Trapps posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself admitted himself sometimes, with some mishaps and poor downpours, not least from Ibrahimovic, who was patched at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart.
Still, he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, whom Di Maria turned into a shooting shot, which was steered by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post
The second goal finally fell just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, with the Uruguayan scoring his sixth season opener after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank from Maxwell.
That ended all the thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland, from a short distance, to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low, before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi escaped a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which doesn't have the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
