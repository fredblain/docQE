Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organisation SPRS is trying to explain to shocking women how important good nutrition is during breastfeeding, and is doing so with the presentation of images of babies sucking to breasts that are painted with depictions of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies' genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
