Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It's one thing that all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it won't last long before you know it almost out of touch.
Unless, of course, you may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, which was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company's super camps, and continues: "fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book that I am happy to read out to my children, because there always seems to be a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All nice and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the book's plot, instead reflects a summary of the film version of 2012, adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy called Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads: A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and who died in 1991, but was completely unaware of that in 1991.
As if that was not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, is hoping to win the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, Cameron seems unlikely to be so familiar with the action of the book, listening to an unnamed boy, such as the local environment, by the money hawkish, trees fake, Thneed knitting onlookers despite the protests of the namesake Lorax, a hooky, cordoned-off creature, "which speaks in the name of the trees," to be devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff but gave no further immediate comments.
