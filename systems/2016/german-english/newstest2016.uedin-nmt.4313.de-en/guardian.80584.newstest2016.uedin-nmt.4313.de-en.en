Experts criticise report from Public Health England over e-cigarettes
Allegations by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, in part with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the "principle report" last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on which PHE reasoned its main conclusion.
Two more researchers write in BMJ and asked if the claims were "based on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a model for multiple causal decision-making analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to lead their opinions on the damage from different nicotine containing products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was previously told of British American Tobacco funds (BAT) for an independent study.
He also underwrote BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he was expected to receive after reports previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, added it.
The reasons for the selection of members of the board are not delivered, but this includes several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, PHE's tobacco management also attended.
The group's research "admits tellingly" that there is a lack of "hard evidence of the damage to most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that PHE's claims that "there has so far been no evidence that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.
He said: "e-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health care system Â£2 billion a year.
By clarifying current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national jurisdiction.
