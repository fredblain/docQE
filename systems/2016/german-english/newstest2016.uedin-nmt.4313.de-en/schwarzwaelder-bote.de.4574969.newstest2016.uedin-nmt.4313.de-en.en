Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old motorist was slightly injured in an accident on the cross-section between Nordring and On Herden.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the cross-section toward the roundabout industrial area and it was late true that at the roundabout, two pre-flight vehicles had stopped.
As a result, he collided with his truck into the rear of an audio and snapped this vehicle on a Ford Fiesta before it.
At the accident victims' vehicles, property damage was caused by about 10 000 euros, police said.
The 33-year-old's Audi was no longer driving and had to be cut off.
