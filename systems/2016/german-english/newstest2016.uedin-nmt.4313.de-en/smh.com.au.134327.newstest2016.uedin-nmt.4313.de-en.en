Peter Moody claims that stewards tried to spy on him and threaten to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the final straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do what was best for racing and he was finding himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tuck test at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had been restrained for 18 months because of the espionage charges and did not want it to "look like high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say about this and I've sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk down the main street, and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them.
If they start thinking I don't, then I shouldn't be more coaches.
I then have to consider what I do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had ramped up the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on its stall.
"Twenty months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I was asked - and offered him an employment in my stables to provide information about what I do within my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, they should certainly catch their noses because they have failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulette, chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time, and are still today.
Should this make me think that it will be personal?
Did the RVL behave cowardly and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people are thinking out there that I am.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, they're now thinking about it.
But I've now got to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have been set up with the long-running Kobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said he "could throw his license across the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horseman, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that," he said.
"One of my staff mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been last night.
It could have been the whole day the whole day, which was the way it was.
But it also had it so on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day, an investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," Moody said.
