Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report following the loss of the Liberals' lead, but there has been no major shifts in ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television shows, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the deal seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise posted an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today posted a slight increase over the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number fell short of the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to the 33,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of arrangers to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result last night answered this with a clear "yes."
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17: 00 to 5.30 p.m.) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17: 30 p.m. to 18: 00) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires Hot-Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half hour of The Chase Australia scored 520,000 viewers and in the second half hour satte 720,000.
Hot-Seat averages 620,000.
The drop in the odds of the second night of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 5: 30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for $1 million minute it did not manage to evade the McGuires show.
