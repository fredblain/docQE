The crowd makes it: Every two years, the automakers on the IAA show their novelties.
In 2015, there is mainly movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particular demand: Around 28.1 per cent of new registrations accounted for this segment in August alone, according to the Motor Office (KBA).
This is also reflected on the IAA (publication date 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new upper class and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at retailers in the autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel chief executive Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
He belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to be sold well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive for this.
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra comes with a new 1.4-liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offers further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 horsepower, to which, for the first time, there are also three-cylinder liners.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is first only as a fifth stunner.
A second variant will follow in the spring of the Kombi, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what is going to happen next to the Astra on the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra-competitor Mégane into the race.
At the trade fair, the Mégane is to be seen exclusively as a fifth man in a conventional and an impressive sporting GT-version.
In trade, he arrives early next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: Quite new in the segment is the Infiniti Q30.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti, with its curved lines, fits perfectly into the brand's design line.
The base model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 horsepower.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0litre turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is based on the manufacturer's data at 170 newtonmeters (Nm).
The sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not completely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
On the outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-Ablegers were mainly hand in front of the front section: Here the fridge was redrawn and the changed headlights fitted with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and integrated Apple's CarPlay for the first time.
In addition, at the IAA in the compact class, a series of revisions and new variants such as the frozen Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
