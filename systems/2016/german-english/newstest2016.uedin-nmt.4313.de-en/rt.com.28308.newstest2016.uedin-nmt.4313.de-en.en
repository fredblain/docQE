Four-fold increase from intake of hand disinfectants by children in last 4 years
Toxic control centers in the U.S. report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallow heavily alcoholic hand-disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of revenue of hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12, which report poison control centers, rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants while some are doing to impress their friends or because of a mutation in social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people are disinfectant only because of a cheap experience.
Youths allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic oral water to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
"A kid doesn't think this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand-disinfectants) are those who are parenting.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grapes and orange duft, which are very appealing to children.
Hanging disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent of alcohol.
Especially in the case of young children, a few spritzer can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the toxic notruf Center at the University of Kansas, told the broadcaster Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you wouldn't let a sip of whisky go around, but people let these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children come to it, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four spritzer from after strawberry flavored hangings in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold that applies to an adult legally considered drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lopped her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children's hospital on signs of brain trauma since the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was very frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and store hand depressants outside the child's reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women died in Ontario women after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active ingredient.
In January, three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their "gema" teacher by issuing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and served them out of her room.
The police regarded the failed plan as "chatter" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
