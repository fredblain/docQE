Eight golden rules for life in student homes
Eleven years ago, I moved as a self-forgotten 19-year-old to a student residence, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I was annoyed - and to the numerous, long-suffering complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The entry into student homes ranges from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to smile: People tell you where you come from, whether and where you've taken Sabbath year, where you are in reference to Corbyn and why you "honestly have Marmite neither love nor hate, because in earnest, guys, it's just a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It distracts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like, unlike those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these fire extinguishers.
Leave people.
People's rooms are often transformed into beverage recipes, film night venues and municipal hits, but they are also the places where people put themselves in and turn their underwear.

Introverts received rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student homes form a space shuttle culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I get the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a commitone of conviviality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking to knock on: Do it.
One guy in my student homes had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
As you start the university at the peak of the Back-mania, the Klopfen is on the doors of people to imagine themselves with a plate full of brownies, less strange than greeting the 1950-year-old "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked something to you, so, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Her fellow residents feel obliged to entertain themselves and, in the end, perhaps associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly missing clumps of flour, sugar and fat mean that people are sleeping when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student homes.
Of course, the clawing of chicken is a theft, but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also?
Check that with the milk owner.
The odds are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced than my co-workers, who added their milk a sink to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
They should not make noise that prevents people from sleep or from work.
It's not just about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the word you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my hallway asked her neighbors whether it made them feel a little quieter, drum & bass, because it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even more tepid music.
When they finally stopped at 5 p.m., they kindly allowed their neighbours to sleep two hours before crashing their own music, closed their door and went to their three-hour test.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn't it be abysmal embarrassing if you keep a co-worker for your future spouse, ranting at her, rebounding herself and then seeing her every day and perhaps witnessing how she wanders all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot co-worker definitely isn't your future spouse, try at least to give your underbelly a little sanity.
At the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between an Ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stint is funny, but it only takes moments before he becomes a boomerang.
Teach by hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but don't look at someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Shut her door, and put her keys in a glass of water, which then put you in the freezer - but punches her possessions on the ceiling no more than twice.
