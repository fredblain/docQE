Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season wasn't particularly funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Earlier, they were once one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoiler, but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a game half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild-card spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three Runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strongly this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw in the bullpen every game, and so I want to be very focused in the game.
The designated Tiger-Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two Runs, his first rbis since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first triple hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has swung the batter well," Ausmus said.
He looked good at (stroke training), looked significantly better out of the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three Runs in the backside at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks hit a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by the left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overran wall, the only man he faced before the presumptive rookie batter Miguel Sano, who tore the right-hander Drew Verhagen a Two-Run.
With a pair of runners and the final rally at the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was that in the Major League leading 27 times this season that Plouffe suggested a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance-Run at the end of the ninth innings, Wall made an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon and scored the stand of 5-4.
However, the right-hander stole Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit profited to the start of the game from an even non-movable Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been dropped from the injury list before the game after missing more than a month because of a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After they got in the first of the leaderboard, Halpin gave up a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, creating a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his 0-21 track record with the Runners in scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers put in the second, scoring a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a Two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big blow," said Twins-manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't score particularly well, but he caught the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the relever right-hander A.J.Achter.
At Hughes, there were three Runs at six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
Notes: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez departed because of an injury to the throwing shoulder.
He is being investigated by Dr James Andrews, who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injury list because of a shoulder strain, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injury list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 because of a tie-up in the right hip.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesotas RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
