The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountaineering village."
From the vice president's hand at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1,000-square-foot village in the Berchtesgaden National Park was awarded the award for soft tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountaineering villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountaineering village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area.
