Man arrested after driver's flight
Police on the weekend arrested a man following a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver curling in Cobram.
The cyclist was rushed to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car Saturday morning on the Murray-Valley motorway.
Police said the motorist continued to drive without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia joined the police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged for driver curling and failing to provide assistance and because of other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
