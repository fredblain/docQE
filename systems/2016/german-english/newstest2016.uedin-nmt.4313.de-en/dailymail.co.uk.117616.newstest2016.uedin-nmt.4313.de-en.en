Internet sales rose at the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for that
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven per cent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
Experts believe the Black Friday in November has slowed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has drilled, and many of Britain's main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnant after new figures showed just seven per cent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August represented the lowest rise in growth since records began in 2000, with only five per cent increase over the previous year.

"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago as buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones.
It meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, such as at home on the sofa.
But now this is shifting, and we may see that growth is diminishing.
The black-friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe buyers will withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers scrambled around their computers to make their bargains, and some vendor websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, in which buyers are battling for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of £5 spending, a little more than £1 was spent online.
With some products such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now done via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
