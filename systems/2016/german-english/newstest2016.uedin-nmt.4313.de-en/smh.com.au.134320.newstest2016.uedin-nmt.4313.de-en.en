Man after fired police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he overtook the man off the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang up the police was unsuccessful when he was in the shallow and marshy waters, just yards away from a police officer who tried to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Police at Canning Vale were called to a domestic violence gang incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, this one tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I don't get out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn't too keen to make his uniform wet, so he used a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman is negotiating."
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to escape an alcohol check and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins-biathlon.
