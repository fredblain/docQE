Outdoors voters are calling for the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the start of the FW Autumn column in major wallabies in the run-up to a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there is no corresponding new teacher for the many new pupils: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before the collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get disruption in the Bavarian education system."
The holiday party of the Free voters will be held in the Lower Franconian Municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were other main issues.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Election Meeting.
"Of course, the subject of asylum will outsource the Klausur," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as it did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"So it's not going to continue, we have to get to the causes," said the Free Election Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push off free voters as soon as possible.
That's why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticised that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards of the federal states nationwide."
"Bayern pushes off, others don't."
"Because we need to become more effective."
But national politics in big wallabies should not fall under the table.
A long standing burner remains on the agenda: Education policy.
As for the new school year, Education Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU), at 47 Gymnasia, launched the pilot experiment "mid-level plus," in which an extension of the high school average of three is tested by three to four years - as a result, it will take nine years to go to high school.
But Aiwanger doesn't go far enough.
"The issue of G9 needs to be speeded up," the FW chief said.
We call for freedom of choice for all gymnasts who want this.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
