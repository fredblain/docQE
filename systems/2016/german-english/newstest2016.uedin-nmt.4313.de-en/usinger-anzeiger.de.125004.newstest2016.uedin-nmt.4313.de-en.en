Spacecraft 'Cassini' finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice panzer of Saturn's Enceladus, a global ocean swung.
This includes researchers from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini."
As a result, the moon appeared easily on its trajectory around the ring planks.
While this thawing movement is only small but too large for a consistently solid celestial body, it is said in a statement released by Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus."
Even longer, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice vulcanes at Saturn's South Pole in 2006, spying water vapour and ice particles, and thus feeding the so-called E-Ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there must be a subterranean sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear.
