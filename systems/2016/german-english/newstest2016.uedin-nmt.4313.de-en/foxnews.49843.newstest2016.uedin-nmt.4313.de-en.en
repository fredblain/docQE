Stars who lost their lucky winner
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he was battling leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, because of cancer.
The actor is also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this certainly takes its toll.
