Eurowings: Lufthansa builds the group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring.
Half a billion euros a year, the Lufthansa Group wants to save itself with a better organisation.
150 of the world's roughly 1,000 executives will cost the group restructuring the job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilots' union.
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evaluates the low-cost carriers of Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of about â‚¬500 million a year from cost and proceeds syncing, the airline said on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa does not have a board in the future for the passenger business.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings.
With the new position, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been complex.
The airlines were operating under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three-quarters of the company's annual sales of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining agreement with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are expected to resume after the court's legal strike on Thursday.
That told the union.
The subject of the talks is intended to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
"In a year with a projected record result," the cockpit aims to achieve sustainable results as soon as possible.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional supply of the pilots, the "Wings" savings concept.
It provides that Lufthansa, in the fight against competitors, places routes to the Group's own low-cost line Eurowings.
