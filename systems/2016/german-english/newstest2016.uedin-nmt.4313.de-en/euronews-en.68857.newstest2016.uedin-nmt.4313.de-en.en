Time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the US Federal Reserve comes together on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that was still the last week of the view that the Fed will do so, now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Fed set interest rates on NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero area and launching a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, chief of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday
