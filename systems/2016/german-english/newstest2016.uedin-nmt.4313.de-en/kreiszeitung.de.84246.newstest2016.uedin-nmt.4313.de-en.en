Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felenstausen.
We are also pleased to welcome Sammy's Mayor Bernd Bormann, Business Development in Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorfs Mayor Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the country, doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, are lucky: On 1 October, Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fellowship.
While Ursel Felenstausen is retiring, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, will face his successor in the next few months with half a point.
After a remodeling period, Müller opens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros into the premises at St Marcellus Road 6.
There was a great deal of sympathy at first sight, when, before years Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who, for the time being, complete their medical education at the Hospital in Vermont and will also be able to enter into practice at the end of the year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felenstausen and laughs.
"When it was up, I just called them."
Mrs Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We would like to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As an advantage, he also sees himself soon to be his own boss.
And so it was agreed, the dumpers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in fracture Vilsen.
There, the two-time family friend, Frank Müller, also grew up, his medical school in Hanover, followed by stations in several doctors' practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
At present, he works as a senior doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was ordered to become a chief medical doctor in Diepholz County, and is a volunteer in the DRK-readiness fault house Vilsen.
As of September 19, the practice is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felenstausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle as family doctors.
"Endoscopy is coming out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound tests as well as long-term and stress EKGs and need a talk room more.
In addition, the IT system is completely renewed.
A grant of a total of EUR 50000 will receive the Müllers within the framework of a grant program from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtcommunity (12500 euros) and the community ($12500).
"This shows how proud and glad we are that the practice continues," notes Samtpublic's chief executive Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the practice field for every quarter, in the North German average practice, it is about 500.
There is another doctor's practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of the practical assumption by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felenstausen.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone, too.
Anyone who visits Müller's speaking time will continue to look, in particular, in familiar faces: Take over the seven medical workers and the cleaners from the field.
With their departure in Asendorf, an era, after all, doctors practiced there for 30 years.
"At the beginning we only had two rooms," Ursel Felenstausen shouted.
A little grumpy, after a long period of time, they have fallen.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients still often," the internist says.
Her husband added laughing: "We have a 6000-square-foot plot."
"So far, I've always pushed myself in front of gardening, now that could be different."
In addition, the couple have two grandchildren and are happy to travel.
