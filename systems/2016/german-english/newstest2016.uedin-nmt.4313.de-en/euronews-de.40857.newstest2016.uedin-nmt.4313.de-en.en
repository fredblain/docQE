Röszke: Outbreak of violence on Serbia's Hungarian border
The Hungarian police have deployed on the Serbian border at Röszke Tearengas and water cannons against several hundred refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported by telephone:
A group of refugees broke the border.
Behind it, a police line was formed and behind the policemen there was a water cannon.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles, according to officials.
The officers initially stopped pepper spray.
After that, police used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas has been spilled in the direction of the refugees.
As a result, the group was disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn somewhat.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had inhaled tear gas shouted.
Other refugees sacked in themselves and suffered from breathing.
Serbian police officials also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
