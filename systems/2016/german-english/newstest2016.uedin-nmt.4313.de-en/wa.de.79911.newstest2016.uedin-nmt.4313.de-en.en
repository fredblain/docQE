Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gold-plated) Dornenkrone is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar-Alt-Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colourful colours and imaginative forms has received the 75-year-old - but in no way synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective subjects, that can be quite bleak.
For about three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of all books."
There have been cycles that address themes such as cross paths, pranks, bids, or fatherhood.
In doing so, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Lutheran publisher with its theological orientation as well as to Kettler-Verlag with its emphasis on art books.
And there is, above all, the author Klaus Altepost, who has worked on the basis of painting with the respective Bible papers.
He has interpreted the Bible texts selected by Otmar Alt and thus translated into the current context.
These lyrics are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible treadmill by Martin Luther and a set of the artist who puts his own personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewellery band has Golden Letters.
So the 75-year-old allows twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggered by the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant missionary.
"Because the education was already done with the cane," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I tried to work that out to help me cope again with the Lord's father."
His second concern is to regain the importance of art at the fastest time: "The perception of image worlds is characterised by advertising today, and that is loud.
Symbolism is being squeezed out there.
Artists have a different desire and cheek to show things.
Pictures always have something secretive and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I'm a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall in" the images, let them look at them, discover and feel the power they have: "The image is looking for its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost acknowledged Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bible in the Otmar-Old Foundation, "always" a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he understands life with his paintings."
Old did not care to fully capture the Bible, but chose the most important, also mysterious themes.
"This was not cooperation on an equal footing," says Altepost: "Here we are talking about the images, the text merely explains," a picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler from Lutheran Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens at the Otmar-old Foundation on November 15.
