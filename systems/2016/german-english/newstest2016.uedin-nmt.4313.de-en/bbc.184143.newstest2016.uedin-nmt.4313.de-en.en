Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyns's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time is eagerly awaited
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is expected to make his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time and to equip himself with David Cameron for the first time.
MR Corbyn will stand up to put the first of its six straight questions shortly after noon, with his performance from the media likely and the Labour MP from close to scrutiny.
He called for "less theater and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyns's leadership, since it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the fall of the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Torah MPs and is at the heart of several front page stories in the newspapers.
MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "been in respectful silence" and he acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air raid around England."
But a member of Mr Corbyns's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnout programme that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns's top team, citing differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC's Political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyns's comments on the position on the European Union and the limit on profits.
MR Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour was making changes to remove the whole idea of a limit overall.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labor and pensions minister, said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to cut the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
MR Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron since he is Tory-leader in the last decade over the dispatch-box in parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from doing both "batting" and the striker with opposition, and has instead moved on to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
MR Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Business Secretary, will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the lower house, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a "fake theatre," which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed to do so.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the most important barometer of the ruling by a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
