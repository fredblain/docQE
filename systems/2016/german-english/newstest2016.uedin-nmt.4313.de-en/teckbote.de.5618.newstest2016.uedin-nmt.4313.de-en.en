Manege invites to dream
With the new staging "passion," the Circus Probst takes on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst in the manege on the brick wall invites you to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior director.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current manning stage.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
The gift to inspire the family, therefore, is in the blood.
"It is important for us to bring people away from their everyday life and take them to a completely different world for two hours," the 27-year-old Juniper says.
"Manegencocktail with a world flair," director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer long tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Distinguished at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to be relaxed.
Ease and agility - with these words, they identify.
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and homogeneity.
Balancing the wheel on a ball?
For He Yuan no problem.
Snake people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little else and fascinated with her mobility.
60 employees from 12 nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," notes Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Grievances in the attitudes of circus animals are all too often an issue in various animal welfare organisations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position: "It is not good for our animals, but we are not doing well."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit.
The "four-legged artistes," as they are affectionately called, are forgotten after the possibility of any request from the eyes.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to be in the manege either.
So the most important thing is to do well for the animals.
Especially on their zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland ponytail and a zebra, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in a walkway and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little Jumbo was there," Brigitte Probst told me.
The zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "No matter whether five or 1 200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all the heart of it."
The Circus Probst invites its performances from 17 to 20 September on a daily basis.
On Sunday, the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 5pm the prices are discounted.
It is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
