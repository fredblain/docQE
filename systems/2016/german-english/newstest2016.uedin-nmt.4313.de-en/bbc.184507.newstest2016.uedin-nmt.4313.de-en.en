The head of JD Sports says higher wages jeopardize expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports's expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
