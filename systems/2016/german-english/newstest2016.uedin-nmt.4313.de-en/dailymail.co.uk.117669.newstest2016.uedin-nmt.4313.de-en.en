B & Q Boss says that the era of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind
As a result, 200 more Screwfix stores, aimed at artisans, will open
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B & Q outlets nationwide

It is claimed that Britons are laying down their hammers and brush in favor of using qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
If you can deal with a hammer or a brush to remove walls, you seem to be in a minority today.
Because Britons increasingly employ craftsmen to carry out pet jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B & Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the tree-lined chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, which offers services to low prices, is now outdated.
That's why Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores that cater to tradesmen and close 60 outlets of B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B & Qshops, because eight out of 10 purchase decisions in the store are taken by women.
At the moment, the employees outweigh the men.
She said it was necessary to confront the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works by a majority of men in our branches.
We need to shift this closer to a balance.
Basically, half of our customers from women are 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FTSE100 index, has also surrounded her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 per cent of the team with women, including its management and CFO.
Mrs Laury said: "This was a deliberate decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a drop in half-year profit and moves after the group owed the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, the Screwfix and B & Q, will open 200 new stores.
