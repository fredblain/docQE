The Brexit-Lager (Brexit = exit of Britain from the EU) could win on allowance if the economy gets into a slump by 2017
David Cameron's ill-fated renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the Tuc, who are fiercely divided because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises, as the EU is now, and not always of their own fault, Britain's own agenda with divided concessions and disturbing treaty changes, which they mostly do not want, are fed up.
In Brighton, the Tuc decided at its annual meeting that it did not like them if they were at risk of social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie's agenda.
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photograph of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain that is outside the EU in the interior of the EU tent - "not alone with France," says Berlin - and suggests that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously bespectacled Chancellor, Angela Merkel, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the excessively long audition like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's Fran√ßois Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a leftist.
It is hard to imagine that they will pull out a leg to help the selfie-British, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from being out of the UK - something they don't want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So perhaps some such ministers are planning even deliberately not helpful remarks, entirely in the SNP-style, during Britain's referential campaign in 2017 to speed up the Brexite process, my friend is suspected.
"The renegotiation was a default" and "Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on its cost, and which EU sceptics are the oligarchy of the Pressebarone, as they did during Tony Benn's inspired referendum in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1.
They can look weak on Boris Johnson, the ore euro opportunist who has made himself a name as a "EU Gerade Banks" Brussels-based correspondent in the early 90-years.
With all his reticence, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-raising villains, phone hacking foreigners and the pseudo non-Instates that own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similar about her, but noted that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better spread bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairians than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's refereeing dumbbells, because Blair had put the principle on the EU's unapproved constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door to him.
The press has never told him to do so.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn't need to waste any time for me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's boycott Murdoch's strategy of the 80-year-old, a mistake then and today.
It can last, but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC-Sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns's official position on Europe is - I call it a friendly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Now, most of the people outside Ukip's traditional blistering bulletins and the wildest jails of Tory's petty Englishism can probably say yes to everyone.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn on the radio and television this week said when the Scouts struggled in him, not to admit that Corbyns's appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70-years when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more appealing.
But struggling to stay "under any circumstances" - Benny's expression - was not what McDonnell said was still what JC told his comrades and deputies after all the reports at their Clues' meeting on Monday night.
Whatever the stemmed Bottom-Up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the strudel of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to keep Labour support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns's fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson is felony confident that JC will not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be required to try to find a sense of their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can all be pointless?
The US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria, even with a cost-cutting of the Tory government in power, where I was reminded of something at the start on Monday, which was called the British Influence Security Forum.
