Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" film
Legends don't want to stir up, but Disney still dares to a new film of its classic "Mary Poppins."
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not about re-filming, but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It's about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family at a time of the Great Depression in England.
Anyone who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already fixed: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" at the cinema.
