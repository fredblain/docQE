Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense that I am a simulated yawn and an armesa length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and the producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "uncontroversial the greatest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
