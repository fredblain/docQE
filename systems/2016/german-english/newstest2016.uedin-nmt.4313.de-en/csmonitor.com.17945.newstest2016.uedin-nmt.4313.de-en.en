This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An interest rate rise is coming, and the domestic bill will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
As a result, representatives of the US central bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the fuss about a rate hike may have been exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of "cheap money,"" said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
By contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low levels to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that does not mean there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends on how some areas of the economy might react:
As the market has seen last month, the anticipation of interest-rate hikes can make things more volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency for asset sales to abate 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," said German bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's rate hikes.
More accurately, the market in the past 35 years has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return will begin to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest-rate hikes often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is most remarkable here is that gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, at the rate of 118 interest rates since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5%.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 per cent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 per cent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest-rate hikes on such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been caught on an interest-rate hike by the Fed all year, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading gives only a 25 percent probability.
"In our study, all increase in the rate of growth from 1950 to present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP, and pre-receptacles very quickly after the start of the recovery," the report concluded.
By contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this has been 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in equities if they change their strategic course.
On bonds, the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/reduction takes place in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to be closer together and lead to a draining of the curve.
High-interest bonds often yield better returns in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about expecting higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting, according to Jones, that markets have already adjusted to Fed-strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the earning curve is flat, credit ratings have expanded and volatility has risen - all features of the market when the Fed tightens its strategy.
At large, companies that handle the larger part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market, as well as financing their debt.
"History shows that "quality" shares tend to react exceedingly positively three months after an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for the customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet have surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, averaging 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital yields as well as low volatility in their shares also transferred their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if experts disagree on how quickly that will take place.
