FedEx earnings mixed, financial prospects cut for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the latest quarter, and the delivery giant cut its profit outlook to a full year because of weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company would want to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell more than 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year that ends next May, 20 cents less than in the earlier forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are an average of 4.9 percent and will be effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that will be charged from November.
The company said that it nevertheless expects earnings to rise above the previous year due to cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "provides solid returns when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade."
Plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than last year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share that 12 of Zacks Investment Research analysts predicted.
Sales rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks surveyed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which brought sales in its unit Express shipments to the stash.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales at ground sports rose 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings decreased due to higher labor costs in the cargo business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
