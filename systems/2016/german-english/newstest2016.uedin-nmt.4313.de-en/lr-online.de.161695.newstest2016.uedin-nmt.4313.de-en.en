Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers.
Even in Hoyerswerda there are a number of people who support disinterested asylum seekers in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even with her 74 Lences, she still likes to teach her.
Every Thursday, she does it in the asylum seeker home at Dillinger Street.
There, it is helping refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, that's quite different teaching than at a proper school.
