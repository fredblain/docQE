Mayor drove 'Gestrandete' across the border
"We were busy with the cleanup after the bridge on Sunday when, suddenly, 10 people were standing with travel agents at the entrance of the tent," according to Wenger's mayor, Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted by train to Passau.
Because Germany had surprisingly stopped railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees, it was for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and who chased the chatter along with two other helpers and their cars across the border into the Near Passau.
At the end of the day, we have forgotten our guests, with a snack and a drink.
We just said we bring them with the car to Passau.
"It was natural for us," Stadler said in the OWN conversation.
They were very grateful.
A man did not take it to pass a generous donation - $100 for the fire brigade.
"It was very pleased to us," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers were transferred from an ICE into a regional train towards Passau on Sunday night in Wels, in order to ensure that rail traffic to Germany was stopped, but still trying to cross the border.
However, the regional train was parked outside the border in Wernstein at the Inn.
In Wernstein, the border crossing is generally high in the course.
The bridge fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday socialise, day before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bayern from Neukirchen.
