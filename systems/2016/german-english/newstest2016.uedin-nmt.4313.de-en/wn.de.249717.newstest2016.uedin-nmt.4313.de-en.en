Robot cars: Government wants to lead the way for Germany
Germany, according to the will of the Federal Government, is to be a technological pioneer in changing the car.
The Federal Cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the auto show IAA of a "new mobility age."
Automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Transport Ministry's strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, there is currently a test track on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to "not be saddled with any additional liability risks," the federal government wants the legal framework "to review and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to raise the maximum speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres.
The Federal Government also wants to apply for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far provides only for the people as drivers.
In the case of automated driving, the car takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the economic ministry, highly automated driving on motorways by 2020 will be technically possible.
Still, driverless vehicles on public roads are expected to be "only far after 2020."
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site of Germany value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPL transport policy chief SÃ¶ren Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the safety of the drivers' personal data must be clearly clarified.
Still, the Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA Institute of Forsa Institute on behalf of the Investigating Decra comes to the conclusion that only eight per cent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years, 32 per cent do not expect it in 20 years, and 31 per cent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of those polled with autonomous cars by 2025, 33 percent in the United States.
Anyway, motorists in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to take control throughout the ride on all roads.
On the motorway, that could mean 15 per cent in flowing traffic, in the traffic jam 45 per cent.
Well every fourth would not leave the car to control under any circumstances.
