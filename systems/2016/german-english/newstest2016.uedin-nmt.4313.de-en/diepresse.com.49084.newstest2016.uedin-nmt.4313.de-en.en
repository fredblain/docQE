Officials from Aich/Dob due to infidelity in court
On Wednesday, two officials from the Austrian volleyball vice-chancellor, Aich/Dob, were to be held responsible for infidelity and dismissal.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of power.
He has been formally acquitted of this allegation in May.
The current trial was adjourned.
According to District Attorney Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it emerged that, in 2006 to 2011, the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to use in their functions for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact left the head of the Council of Scots, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It is to be negotiated at a later date.
To dismiss the infidelity, the defense set out that the club had not created an asset afterward at any time.
Sports officials had only billed expenses and sued the sports club, for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of the debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 shillings (about 44,000 euros).
"At that time, we stood in front of the situation: Do we continue or block the club?" he told one of the defendants, in the bread profession of the Financial Office.
With his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take on that task.
With all the risks.
"We have put forward money, our life insurance as security at the bank," he said at concussion.
The association has been agreed: You can manage the money freely, only no debt can be made.
Furthermore, in the event of a corresponding financial success, the payment of expenses retroactive to 1991 has been decided.
As a result, some of the expenses were paid only years later, as from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, flat and non-detailed bookings seemed to be the case, the former Obman explained the events.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts had not been fully disclosed to the club, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the detail of financial management, important only was debt freedom, according to the response.
When, in 2011, against an official investigation into abuse of office, an amount of €120,000 was transferred to the association's account.
These were resignations, the defendants said.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the club, according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondents did not know the answer for a long time.
He eventually said that he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-accused had been informed, justified by the official.
This bank transfer has been formulated as a "damage recovery."
Why claim damages?, wanted Judge and prosecutor to know.
On that, the first defendant declared that he did not agree with that wording because the association had never been harmed.
But what should I do when the lawyer says, "With that, you're all out of the tailor."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
In addition, the official said he never paid a cent salary, he only billed mileage fees and diets.
On diets, he billed the club £1,000 a month, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not show the defendants.
These were no longer preserved after an operating audit, in which everything had been judged correctly, they said.
Mileage allowance had also been referred to the second defendant.
All sticking points were made in cash, to which he would have to move from his hometown of international market to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
