Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logging into an online messaging service from which he received a number of indecent images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "concerned" web search that used terms for searching indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he did it, as it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head when he was drinking, and said he then wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was on the trepidation and on the wines.
She then also saw the indecent images on the phone and confrontational the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computer and Playstation to speak with girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment to include indecent images of children on June 14 last year, on 25 January this year, against the conditions, and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg not appear in the register of sexual offenders as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case but was held in custody for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was admitted to the directory of sexual offenders before the date of the ruling.
