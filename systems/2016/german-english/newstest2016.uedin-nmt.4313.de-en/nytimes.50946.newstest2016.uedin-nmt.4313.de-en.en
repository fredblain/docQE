4 people killed after police shooting rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence erupted Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, resident district officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and firebombs.
MR Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot in the air before pulling back on rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, of which it is known that they can kill, but which are traditionally used as a less-lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the ethnic group of the Madhesi say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since Oct. 10.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
