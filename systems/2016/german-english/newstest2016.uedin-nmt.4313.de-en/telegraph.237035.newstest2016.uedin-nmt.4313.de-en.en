FriendsFest: The comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove to be at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miseruation (CALM - campaign against a pathetic life) announced in 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help if they needed that.
Friendship is at the heart of the battle to meet this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the suffering had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy mood," his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends so that a friendship can work.
In the age of communication on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lifelike and successful, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrine values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of inconsolate values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a far more profound effect on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can't buy happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that this focus was placed on his head.
Each character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, who was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments at the football look in cozy armchairs and the yearning of Ross to Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to explore entirely their feelings.
As one employee of the telephone teacher explained to me: "my audience's role for people who feel depressed and self-morseless, really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends.
The old phrase "I am coping with it" has an enormous impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems."
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term response mechanisms.
It clearly presents the little moments of men's friendship.
So much my objective outsider status over the phone to people in the eye of despair may also help, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend's Comedy Central FriendsFest with the backdrop completely redesigned to celebrate the day, then why not take your friends to a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship might make.
Friends will be sent to Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for # FriendsFest
