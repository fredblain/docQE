JVA Berlin Tegel: Five square meters of cell are beneath human dignity
The Federal Constitutional Court gave Tegel quite, which was accommodated for months in a too small cell to a ex-prisoner of the penal institution.
Because of the injury of their human dignity prisoners have in principle requirement on financial compensation, if they are accommodated in too small cells.
That decided the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday published resolution.
The concerning can hope according to the judges even for money if they only few days were locked up in to close areas (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus a ex-prisoner was successful with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: It was accommodated in the penal institution Berlin Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square meters of floor space; the toilet was spatially not separated.
Afterwards the man, who is according to its lawyer meanwhile free foot, had been moved into a larger cell.
Its official liability complaint because of the unworthy prison conditions against Land Berlin failed.
But the constitutional court judges waived the judgement of the Court of Appeal Berlin and rejected the case for renewed examination there.
They see the human dignity of the man injured.
Court of Appeal decides now on height of the compensation
Even if for legal reasons of the questionable period only a few day is relevant detention days for the compensation, a balance requirement is given, it was said.
Otherwise would be “diminishing the legal protection of the personality to fear”.
The Court of Appeal must clarify the height of the cash indemnity now.
The constitutional court judges often strengthened in the past already the rights of convicts.
Thus they awarded to a prisoner compensation only in April, because he was locked up naked in a cell.
A decision of 2011 according to also the multiple reservation of a cell without separate toilet is beneath human dignity.
Karlsruhe confirmed beyond that on Wednesday outside besides the citizen of Berlin Supreme Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 an accommodation beneath human dignity.
The plaintiff at that time was daily accommodated between 15 to 21 hours in a homogenous cell as in Karlsruhe the case over three months.
The citizens of Berlin of prisons had come in the last weeks also because of missing staff into the headlines.
Prisoner therefore again and again 23 hours enclosed, the aggressiveness rises, even to fights is it because of the strained situation to have come.
After information of the public relations department of the Department of Just 21 places are not occupied in Tegel because of lack of recruits, 19 are 2016 to be omitted.
