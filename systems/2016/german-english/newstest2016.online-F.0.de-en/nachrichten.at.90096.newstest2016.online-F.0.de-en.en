That Viktor Orbán sends now further thousands to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp Röszke immediately with the establishment from structures to, which ensure humanity, our Federal Chancellor high-officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the vapor circle of the national socialism moved.
Suffering-basic of this politics are not only those Austrians, who are confronted with chaotic conditions now in the border areas.
Also the fleeing will realize that the “promised land”, which invited and was called them welcome nothing when a further refugee camp is.
It will become a large challenge, in view of the continuous streams of refugees and the approaching winter to manufacture with us humane conditions for protection-looking for.
And it will be still larger - peace to maintain security and stability in Austria.
