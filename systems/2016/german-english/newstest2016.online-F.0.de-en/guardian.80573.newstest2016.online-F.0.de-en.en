The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit of Great Britain from the European Union) could win at inlet, if the economy comes up to the year 2017 into a calm air
David Camerons's ill-considered renegotiation strategy, in order to hold Great Britain in the European Union, with each day, even without the choice of the ingenious Jeremy “is it will more deeply in trouble turn out yes or no?” Corbyn to the leader of labour or the TUC, which fell out themselves because of Europe on Tuesday violently.
Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states, into different crises, as the European Union it is as deeply involved just and not always from own debt, of Great Britain provided agenda with split concessions and disturbing contract modifications, which would mostly not like it are full.
In Brighton the TUC decided on its annual meeting that it does not like these also, if they endanger the social protection.
We could call Dave and Georges Selfie-Agenda it also.
Prime ministers and Ministers of Finance climb on summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, make a photo of itself before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, come then home and say that it allied for reforms wins.
It always concerns me.
My European friend, after outside looking Great Britain inside the European Union-tent wishes - “leave us not alone with France”, says Berlin - and lets see through that more and more short-sighted Ministers and official came in some capitals up to the point, at which it them is all the same whether we remain or to go.
Of Germany carefully deliberated chancellor Angela Merkel is an allied one, but she is for 10 years at power and wants the office to leave, before it looks bad for her, as with long enduring exaggerated it such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) happened.
Of France François Hollande looks on his re-election or his replacement in the year 2017.
It is also a fading strength.
Poland has possibly soon a nationalistic right government, Spain a left.
It falls heavily to introduce itself that they will peel themselves off a leg, to prevent in order to help the Selfie British, whose energy should be used better for it, Scotland withdrawal from the UK - something that it also not to want, because most similar separatist tendencies have.
Therefore possibly some such Ministers do not plan even intentionally helpful notes, completely in the SNP style, during of Great Britain referendum campaign 2017, in order to accelerate the Brexit process, assume my friend.
“The renegotiation was not a failure” and “Great Britain anything from value from the renegotiation won.”
The Europeans know, how can be predatory Fleet Street at their expense and which European Union-sceptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, how they were it during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn 1975 however not, our entrance 1973 with a relationship of 2:1 supported.
They can itself weakly at Boris Johnson, whom remind ore euro-opportunist, who made itself a name as “European Union-straight line-bananas” a Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
With all its madness OD Miliband knew, who its enemies were.
In addition belonged the Medley of tax fear rogues, telephone-chopping foreigners and the pseudo non--residents, who possess most of our large newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly of it, it determined however that, if one sits with a hot gorilla in a cage one distributes better bananas to become in order to divert it, instead of its lunch and dinner.
Indeed was Miliband of more Blairianer than Blair themselves, than he opposed Cameron's referendum eddies, because the principle had placed to Blair over the not adopted condition of the European Union, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in the year 2005, who opened thereby a back door for him.
Die Presse also never forgave it.
But nice Jeremy Corbyn, that me on Monday in Westminster a friendly flip on the backs gave - I said to it that he no more time for me to waste need - seems in danger to repeat Neil Kinnocks's boycott Murdoch strategy of the 80's an error at that time and today.
It can last, but it does not have to develop a coherent strategy, in order to win the media, with me, but surely with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position to Europe actual I presses it times friendly out in the development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed European Union.
Now, which can probably say most humans outside of Ukips traditional woad tendency and the wilder realms of Torys Klein-Engländerismus to everyone to it yes.
It is what Hilary “a Benn, but no Bennite” Benn in the radio and on TV this week said, when the scout fought in him not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provoking John McDonnell was as shade chancellors a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's, when its old father endeavored itself on TV to be disloyal opposite his labour colleagues from the cabinet without too far to go and its cabinet job lose.
Hilarys fight was still more attractive.
But to fight, in order to remain “under all circumstances” - Benns expression - what said McDonnell, was still which JC its fellow combatants and delegates after all reports on its closed conference on Monday evening told.
Whatever the tear-jerking Bottom UP image of Corbyn to arrange wants - to think it to the fact that it agitated even me - news discipline remains around the clock important and first of all in the age by TV in the vortex of the social media, a breeding place by paranoia and betrayal.
It is correct to give to Cameron no free ticket for Europe it permitted to hold Labours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course how McDonnell said it.
Simon Jenkins thinks surely in such a way.
But McDonnell and Corbyns basic ambiguities to EU membership - in conformity with its Bennite FE storage economy, her anti-capitalistic past - is no longer only one question of the esoteric discussion under left dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC does not start a campaign to the withdrawal - foreign diplomats will be obligated to try in everything a sense for their superiors at home to find.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital to make - they have also distrustful voters - around concessions on the British if all of this can be senseless?
The USA are already rather disappointed by the weak military achievement in Iraq, in Libya and in Syria, even with a reduction of costs of the Tory government at power, that I was reminded when starting on Monday by something, what British Influence Security forum called themselves.
