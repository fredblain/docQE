'Sonogenetics' can steer brain cells by sound waves
The video shows, how the Nematoden changes the direction in the moment, in which it with sound impulses is illuminated.
Scientists bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be steered by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny Nematoden changes the direction in the instant in that it with sound impulses, which have for the human hearing to high frequencies, in order to be heard to be illuminated.
The impulses work by switching on on of motor neuron cells, which are genetically changed, in order to carry the diaphragm channels, which react to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said, who showed worms the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, with the ultrasonic be used can, in order a set of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body to activate.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk of institutes in La Jolla, California, said an invasive procedure, which delivers electrical impulses into the brain from humans to the treatment of the symptoms of the parkinson's disease to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depth brain stimulation.
Thread worms do not react usually to ultrasonic, but Chalasani stated that they did it, if they were surrounded with microscopic bubbles by a liquid.
, He found, strengthens the blisters out the ultrasonic waves, which penetrate then into the worms.
The intensified ultrasonic waves affect structures, which are called TRP-4-Ionenkanäle and in the diaphragms of some the worm cells are found.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells, they are assigned to which, such a report Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasonic-steered Nematoden, Chalasani changed genetically the worms in such a way that some its TRP-4-Ionenkanäle carried for motor neurons.
If it applies ultrasonic to the changed creatures, the sound waves are strengthened by the micro vesicles and transferred into the worms, where they switch on for changed motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, innovative tools, which make scientists possible, neurons with impulses of the light switch on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages in relation to this technology.
Contrary to light, which must be down-sent to optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low frequency ultrasonic waves fabrics can unhindered happen and know into the brain from above on the head to be sent in such a way.
“We believe to make that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible, targeted the human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical attitude to certain neurological treatments”, said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, added it.
