Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis earns rather praise as criticism for its behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one the “collateral damage” in the recent storm approximately around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned in opinion of the president of the Australian tennis federation Steve Healy rather praise as criticism for its own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented Duos, which is designated again and again than “special Ks”, came by the notorious argument of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka with the Montreal of Masters into the footlights.
In a fiery qualification play in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, whereby Harrison proclaimed: “Wawrinka would have had to strike Kyrgios, and I should strike the child.”
While he was seen last, how he smashed a tennis racquet, after a cramp defeated a potential US-Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis of Healy steadfast was defended.
The teenager is at present in Glasgow, in the competition with SAM Groth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
“A thing, over which I get excited rather, is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi a little was pulled in into the controversy,” said Healy.
It broke a racquet, when he lost because of a cramp into the US-Open, but he is not the first player, who broke a racquet from frustration with itself, and I know Thanasi well enough, in order to know that he is not proud on it.
But, really, he has himself into the US-Open extremely well held back, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he earns much acknowledgment.
It has a great team around itself, it has a great family around itself, and I believe that he was a little too strictly treated.
It is very more ripely 19-year old, it works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he ever a problem with the other players had, he within the coat range was not respected, he trained hard, he is well in form, he is a very sturdy and matured young chap, and I believe, he earn it by its own earnings to be judged.
Healy supported also the decision not to consider Kyrgios during the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday, and he describes the “common decision” as the correct for all, but he assures to the man from Canberra to return as a long-term firm component to the team.”
“First we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not on all the controversies [Kyrgios],” it said approximately to Healy.
And I believe that nod very fast the ascent created, on which people referred such as Federer and Murray. It rises in the eyes of the public, and he has some bad errors made and earned all the criticism, which he gets, but we to try to support it we to try, to make for it the consequences of its acting understandable. Some consider time outside of the footlights, in which he can only think about it, I appropriate, and it is best for the crew and it is the best for it.
