Professional sport mountain climber and operating assistance Isaac Caldiero the first athlete, which won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, became and which large price of 1 million $ with home took.
The competition show, which concluded straight its 7th season, had not experienced ever a competitor, who could conclude all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season final created it two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, in the final.
To the last task climbing at a foot belonged to 75 is enough for climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten terminated the task within the time, with which it was the first athlete, which completed the arduous phase 4 from American Ninja Warrior. However Caldiero terminated this challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard fought for victory, still under the shock over the profit of the large price of 1 million $.
“I mean, it am amazing to think about it I never more than 10,000 $ earned or to the life had”, said Isaac E! over its heap money.
… as I cannot even introduce itself, as that is as completely suddenly… the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed put itself with The Hollywood Reporter, around which final to discuss and why to Britten, although it terminated the course as the first at all, not any prize money receives.
To the rules the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there more than a finalists is, receives it that with the fastest time”, said Weed.
Like the very money a marvelous price is changed and the life, it receives the great bonus.
I do not believe that he preserves over it any resentment.
It is straight to have so happy done, what he did.
It received masses of awards from fans.
He is such a great chap and a family man.

Geoff told me: “If I of someone to be struck should, then I am glad that it is Isaac.”
And I think that Isaac would have exactly the same felt, if they had exchanged the roles.
