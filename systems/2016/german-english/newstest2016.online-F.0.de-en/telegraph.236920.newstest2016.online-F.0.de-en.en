FC arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team colleagues before the play must stand against direct current generator Zagreb behind injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed opposite Wilshere that it was only September and if its rehablitation runs after plan it no reason gives, why he can play not before Christmas again.
This optimistic scenario means already that Wilshere will miss the next four plays for England surely at least and in view of its history is its participation in the next summer at the European championship surely still uncertainly.
The large dishonor for this current problem is that Wilshere had strongly terminated the last season after a separate ankle injury and then again to its old momentum during the preseason had found the way back.
“This kind threatened by injury the career”, did not say Wenger.
It is a bone, which did not heal well.
That is not a larger affair.
This was only one accident.
It was not located in connection with its ankles or with the injuries, which it had before.
That may be true from purely medical view, but like Wenger, gives it also recognized the associated danger of further injuries, every time a player tries to return in the middle in the season.
Also an unpleasant sample develops.
The investigation of Prime Minister Injuries Ltd. registers 23 different illnesses of Wilshere since its debut before six years.
It played also in only 65 of arsenal 157 league plays in the last five play times.
The broader picture for arsenal is that they were in six of eight play times since 2007/08 one of the two Prime Minister League clubs, which have to register most injury days.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement will persist with the injury ratio during the last season.
“Sometimes, if you return from an injury, have a susceptible period, a time, in which you must strengthen your body and win combat capability”, said Wenger.
Jack is young enough, in order to overcome.
I hope, its body stabilize, I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the kind, which he earns.
Arsenal begins its championsleague season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb before the plays against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on coming Wednesday, and Wenger stops itself a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta might start.
Wenger can begin also with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
“I try to hold and the players, who need it, a small breather grant the balance”, said Wenger.
Although arsenal clear favorites are to get ahead by group of F the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Direct current generator is also unbeaten after 41 plays, after “invincibly” the campaign was started in the last season.
The stadium was shaken Tuesday evening by an earthquake, whereby on the judge scale 3.2 were measured.
This year was it 10. in Zagreb.
Wenger is the opinion the fact that arsenal drew the teachings from the past season with the championsleague surrender against Monaco and remains of far hope floated to lead with its management the club to its first European Cup Triumph.
“This drive is immense”, said Wenger.
It did not fold with arsenal ever.
We were very close in the year 2006 to it, but on the other side I am for a long time enough in the business, in order to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
