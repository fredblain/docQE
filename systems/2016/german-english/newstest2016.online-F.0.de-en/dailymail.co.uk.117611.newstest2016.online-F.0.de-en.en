BBC radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says member of parliament Andrew Bingham
The conservative the member of the parliament criticized the transmitter because of his “stultification”
It argues that he is not to be differentiated increasingly of commercial rivals.
It aimed also at the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the transmission The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC radio 3 “changes itself” to Classic FM, maintains a prominent member of parliament and increases new pressure to the transmitter to prove that it does something, to what the private stations does not do.
The conservative delegate Andrew Bingham said also to the BBC bosses that the public radio station “hebetates” and increasingly no more from its commercial competitors to is not to be differentiated.
“Radio 3 seems - I do not use the word “hebetate” gladly - however it seems to Classic FM to transform”, said it.
It aimed also at the BBC Music Awards, which started in last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, The Brits seem to be only under another name.
Thus to do, if you try, something else - these are two examples spontaneously specified, with which you imitate actually only that, which on the market is already”, said Mr Bingham.
BBC general manager rejected the reproaches and argued that BBC radio 3 lay far before its commercial competitors, if it concerns live music and clearing-up of the public.
Which I learn from radio 3, which I will not differently learn over classical music anywhere.
And there is a commitment for live music and making music, which are really unsurpassed.
“And the commitment of radio 3 also real to find and new works in order give new music, consider I important”, said he.
Beginning of this year argued BBC radio 3 CONTROLLER Alan Davey that harder had to be worked to engage the audience when it did this in the past, because the British are informed about classical music less.
Radio 3 was not however the only element of BBC production, which came during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sport under fires to step the commercial rival on the feet.
The Tory delegate Damien Collins seized The Voice on the musical talent show of the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £.
Do you see, why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly saliently?
Lord Hall insisted on the fact that the BBC 1-show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced “in special BBC way”.
It added, it desires that the enterprise finds “a hit from our internal stable”, if it starts next time an entertainment series.
However it refused excluding the order from further rows of The Voice in the future or spending money of the fee payers on other maintenance formats.
