Robot car: Government wants role of the pioneer for Germany
Germany is to be after the will of the Federal Government with the change of the car of technological outriders.
The Federal Cabinet decided a strategy document from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) on Wednesday, who plans among other things investments into the development of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the car fair IAA of a “new mobility age”.
Automated and interlaced driving will increase the road safety and for less back-up provide, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the topic also with his colleagues from the G7-Staaten, which meets on the IAA also with representatives the industry.
The strategy document of the Ministry of Transport stresses among other things the meaning of the mobile broadband development and a brisk Umstiegs on digital sound broadcasting.
For the testing of new technology at present a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria develops.
Thus the driver “to be put on”, the Federal Government the legal basic conditions does not want to examine additional liability risks “and, where necessary, to which new developments adapt”.
So Germany wants to use itself about internationally for the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self-propelled cars is raised of 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The Federal Government wants to support in addition a change of the vienna convention, which plans so far only humans as a driver.
During automated driving increasingly the car takes over the guidance, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is based particularly on sensors and cameras, which seize the environment and which data process within seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs high-automated driving on motorways until 2020 will be technically possible.
Nevertheless vehicles without driver on public roads are “only far after 2020 to expect”.
The authors of the study estimate the creation of value within the range of the Fahrerassistenzsysteme and the high-automated driving functions at Germany for 2025 on approximately 8.4 billion euros.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to more security and efficiency in the traffic”, said the SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
The question of the liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clarified however.
Still the Germans see self-propelled cars however sceptically - to much more than Frenchmen or Americans.
On Wednesday on the AA submitted survey of the Forsa institute on behalf the test organization Dekra it comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will become generally accepted in the coming ten years, to 32 percent count only in 20 years thereby, 31 percent believe not at all in it.
In France count 21 percent of the asked ones until 2025 on autonomously driving cars, in the USA 33 percent.
Anyway the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
After a collection of the digital federation Bitkom only seven percent would agree to deliver control during the entire trip on all roads.
On the motorway could in flowing traffic nevertheless the 15 percent imagine, in the back-up 45 percent.
Well each fourth was left to the car control under no circumstances.
