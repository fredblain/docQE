Who smokes, a higher risk has to lose teeth
Who smokes, harms thereby not only the lung, but also the teeth - a Potsdamer suggests long-term study.
The good message: With renouncement the risk sinks fast.
Smokers have a clearly increased risk to lose their teeth early.
That comes out from the long-term study of an international research team, among them several employees of the German institute for nutrition research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared with nonsmokers the risk lay to lose their teeth prematurely around the 2.5 - to 3,6-Fache more highly with smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
Main causes for tooth loss are caries and inflammations of the gums, stress the DIfE.
For this Periodontitis smoking is a factor of risk, stresses the authors.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss decreases from there to more frequent gingivitises with smokers.
It is not clarified to what extent smoking increases also the risk for caries.
Humans, who stopped with smoking, could reduce their risk however within a short time, write the researchers in the “journal OF Dental Research”.
It can last however over ten years, until the endangerment sinks the level of nonsmokers, explained Erstautor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
One must convince humans to become nonsmokers explained directors of studies Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: “Smoking shortens the lifetime.”
Not to smoke is good for lung and containers and leads after our realizations also to a good dental health in the great age.
In Germany the DIfE is concerned over 20 percent of the population in the age from 65 to 74 years of toothlessness, communicated.
Earlier investigations would have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk for early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
