'Projectiles in Joburg': Homeless young people trained as photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a bang-hard place, if one is homeless.
But a group of former road children found a way to learn a talent and earn themselves thereby living costs.
“I which SHOT in Joburg” (I became ge (he), in Joburg, shot) is a non-profit studio, which informs homeless young people therein as they take up photos of their environment and obtain a profit from it.
BBC news met one of the first graduates of the project.
