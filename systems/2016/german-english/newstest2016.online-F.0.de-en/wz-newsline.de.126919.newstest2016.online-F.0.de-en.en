Decoration instead of curtain - Plauener point as fashion niche
In former times it concerned to make meters at the long embroidery machines into and over to Plauen.
The embroidered materials and points developed in large quantity for customers, who processed them for example to covers and curtains.
Alone functioned today the no more, does not explain Andreas Reinhardt, Geschäftsführer of the fashion point Plauen.
Instead the fashion is again important.
In the start times of the Plauener point fashion played a larger role, then by the home textile industry displaced - and now than niche is rediscovered.
Reinhardt calls some examples: Point in jewelry, with accessories such as bags and with regional traditional costumes.
At all form the so-called Vintage fashion, which follows past style epochs, an increasing order potential.
Who does not serve niches in the textile trade in Germany, no more is not at the market.
With us they already constitute half of all orders.
Fashion point Plauen is together with nine further enterprises member in the branch federation Plauener point and embroideries.
Only they may carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years are approximately 80 percent of the revenue broken off.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale are not there nearly any longer.
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly still.
The mass-produced goods are many more cheaply manufactured nowadays in the Asian area and driven out almost exclusively over chains.
In addition slack off the export, up-to-date to Russia and into the USA.
Sufficient reasons thus for new ways.
The branch federation tries to score also by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of the stick bead in Falkenstein explains: “For this year we lead a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and social action compatibly”.
Reinhardt supplements: “Refers also to the used materials”.
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch office of the westSaxon university Zwickau - at the faculty for applied art - and is specialized in embroideries and points.
In order to oppose to the competition from the Asian area something, one must find high-quality and innovative products.
That needs time and courage.
Develops an area of conflict between the freshest ideas of the designers and the enterprises, which must think above all economically”, say Schmidt.
Therefore an existing design often only slightly one vary, in order to hold a customer master.
Some years ago textile designer Kati Reuter encouraged the historical snowball point again.
The machine in some places small balls stickt.
The Plauener goldsmith champion Bianca Hallebach-Krauße let itself inspire of it: “Before I could not begin anything with traditional Plauener point”.
Now it uses the snowball point for her jewelry.
In a complex procedure it coins the sample in silver.
“Many humans of the region identify themselves with the topic Plauener point - young and old”, Reuter says.
It supplies also to the USA, to Australia and to Finland - particularly at customers, whose ancestor in Plauen and environment lived and which would like a piece of memory.
With it I see jewelry meaning as a modern Ambassador of the Plauener point.
