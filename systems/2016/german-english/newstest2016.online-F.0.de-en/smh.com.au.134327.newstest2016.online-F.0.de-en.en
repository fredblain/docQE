Peter Moody stated that stewards tried, it to spy and threatens to terminate racing
Peter Moody stated that stewards of Racing Victoria tried, in passed the year a spy in its stables to install and threatened to terminate a running immediately.
It aimed at the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and stated the fact that her a personal campaign against it with the Late Scratching of lady Tatai because of a running daily treatment who on Wednesday, accomplished last straw.
Moody said fair fax Media that he had always tried to do what for racing is best and he had found himself under difficult conditions, when it concerned the positive cobalt swab sample with Lidaris, which it cannot explain.
It had held back itself and did not want 18 months because of the espionage reproaches not that it looks “as too highly hanging clusters.”
“I intended to say nothing in addition and I had for a long time sat on it, but you are so frustrated sometimes that everything comes out, said at once” Moody.
They know that it continued.
Sometimes one reacts, and one must live with the consequences, and I must live thereby which I said.
I will this evening home go and well will sleep.
I would like to go around edifying head, and I would like that my owners think that I try my best for her.
If they begin to think, I do that not, then I should not be any more coach.
I must consider then, what I do with my license.
Before Moody had left the bomb in an interview with racing.com lift-off that the integrity department had tried to spy its stable.
“Eighteen months ago sat Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in an area with a man - whom I will designate, if I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my stables, around information about what I do within my stables, to supply”, said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously believe that I am a cheat.
If that is the case, they should surely seize themselves to their noses, because them with the attempt to seize me to have failed.
Robert Roulston, ehem. chairmen of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were conscious itself of its at the time and are it still today.
Should that bring me to the opinion that it becomes personal?
Did the RVL hold back and does make themselves cowardly perhaps people outside responsible for from coaches which proceeds in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people think there outside that I am it.
Perhaps they must to me my license take and me offend, and I do not have a doubt that what I say lets her think now about it.
But I arrived now at the point, at which that is all the same to me, and which makes me sadly.
That makes me really sad.
I will exert the pressure on it and her urge to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of the coach developed themselves with the long persisting cobalt investigation with Lidari, and it led the Late Scratching to the fact that he said that he could throw “its license over the table.”
Moody, best admits by its preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, designated the running tag treatment rule “ridiculously”, after a packing mud or tone had been laid on on the horse legs, what against the rules offended.
“It is against the rules of racing.
I must take for it the full responsibility”, said he.
“One of my employees has erroneous-proves mud on the leg laid on.
It could have like that been last night.
It could have like that been yesterday all day long, which also like that was.
It had it in addition, so on the running day.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment with the packing on the running day. An investigation of this affair was opened.
It is a joke.
Humans, who set up these rules, do not know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but one too far went here”, said Moody.
