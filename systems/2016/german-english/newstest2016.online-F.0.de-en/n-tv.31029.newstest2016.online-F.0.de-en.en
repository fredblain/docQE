Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is strained.
Also more and more refugees look for a payable lodging.
The pressure on the housing market grows.
The social housing construction stands before a challenge.
The resource allocation conflicts on the German housing market began for a long time.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the European Union urge more and more humans on a market, which is overloaded in many large cities already.
They compete with low-income citizens around the last payable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for payable apartments, 400,000 new units would have to be built until 2020 each year.
To this result a study comes on behalf the federation alliance “social housing construction”.
To the comparison: In this year 260,000 units become finished in Germany.
Thus 140,000 apartments are missing.
Refugees are no longer obligated after the first three months of their stay to live than asylum-seekers in a Erstaufnahmeunterkunft.
Many encounter then the housing market and join the long queues before the rented flats.
According to Federal Statistical Office lived in the last year however less than half of all asylum seekers to the rent.
The negative development of the housing market is not however only because of the rising refugee numbers.
The study constitutes also substantial omissions in the housing policy of the last years.
Germany moves a housing shortage over before itself, which becomes larger from year to year.
Up-to-date already approximately 770,000 housing units were missing, deplore Matthias Günther, Autor of the study in the densely populated areas.
Many working persons lived therefore in large cities perforce in WG-rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer because of the calm air on the housing market in the “hotel mummy”.
In the large cities the number of the square meters per head sank in the past years for the first time again.
In order to solve the problem, the alliance “social housing construction” suggests a restart.
New incentives are to again set the social housing construction in motion.
So suspend the real estate tax for promoted apartments could do limited without the tax on real estate transactions and.
Besides attractive fiscal depreciation possibilities are necessary according to alliance.
The advancement program for refugee accommodation of the state bank 9 KfW arrives at cities and communities already well.
A good week after the start had been already called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the approximately 300 million euros the available.
Now the project could be even supplemented.
