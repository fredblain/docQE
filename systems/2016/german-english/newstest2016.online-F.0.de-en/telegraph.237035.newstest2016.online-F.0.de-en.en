FriendsFest: the Comedy show, which gives us serious lessons over man friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obviously, particularly with this in view, as the need for men to open than ever before became now still more desperate, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high prove.
In the year 2013 it was the most important cause of death with men in the age from 20 to 45 in Great Britain, and it remains three times more frequently with men than with women.
In the effort to concern the problem the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, to question with whom a goal, the culture, which prevents men to look for assistance if they need these.
Friendship is the heart in the fight, in order to master this challenge.
A current study with more than 2,000 High School pupils with depressive symptoms stated that, if the suffering had a sufficient high percentage at friends with “healthy tendency” its opportunities doubled themselves on recovery.
For those, which are not depressive, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But naturally one must have for a start friends, so that a friendship can function.
In the age across social media directed of communication, with their emphasis on style across substance the immediacy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact.
Our digital lives have the necessity, strongly, to appear gaily and successfully doubled, even if in reality the isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated of, which psychologists extrinsische values call; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer values - our internal longing after personal development and friendship, which affect our mental health many more deeply.
And like a video game inventor and a billionaire recently explained, money cannot buy luck really.
The beautiful with Friends was that this focusing was placed on the head.
Each character did not become by its work, but defines by its personality, that shone by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent embraces, moments when football looking in cosy armchairs and the longing from steed to Rachel - all it came from the knowledge that men can refer to in any case even if they often hold back themselves to explore completely their feelings.
As an employee of the crisis hotline it me explained: … “my listener role for humans, who are depressive to feel and potentially suicidal, really clearly showed me, as even the smallest interactions of friends a difference to make can.”
The men, who contact us, often do not feel in the situation to speak with friends.
The old idiom “I come thereby by right” has an enormous effect, like the feeling that it is noticed as weakness, if one speaks about problems openly.”
Friends is one of the shows, which me strikes, if I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It presents completely clearly the small moments of man friendships.
So much my objective outsider status over the telephone humans in instants of the despair to also help likes, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you arranged on this weekend Comedy cent ral FriendsFest with backdrop in honor of the day completely new visit, why you do not carry then your friends forward to a drink in the cent ral Perk.
Or, still better, if you see sitting around into of Starbucks someone alone, give him a smile and say you to hello.
One never knows, your friendship which difference could make.
