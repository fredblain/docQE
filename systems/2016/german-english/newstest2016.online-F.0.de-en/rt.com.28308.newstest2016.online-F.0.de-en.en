Physicians supervised it over night in a separate children's hospital on signs of cerebral trauma, since the girl was fallen by the alcohol and had pushed the head, said Ritchey.
“That was much frightening”, said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfection cloths and to store hand disinfectants outside of the range of the child.
