Gaultier feels old for a Enfant terrible
It is a mixture from completely large fashion show and a waxwork Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich over his work.
The high points: Shop window dolls, which look alarmingly human owing to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became among other things with of Madonna's stage outfit to the large star the fashion scene - and thus that he put men into skirts.
“I cannot say today no more that I am the Enfant terrible of the haute couture, because I have white hair.”
“Early one was it bleached, in the meantime is genuine it”, said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition “From The SID-mill tons of The Catwalk” (of the sidewalk on the gangway), which from 18 September on in the arts center of the Hypo Kulturstiftung to be seen is, is it a luck that the fashion creator changed its at the beginning of rejecting attitude to an exhibition over his person.
Actually it against it was, because: “For me an exhibition sounded a little after death”, said it.
If one dies, one comes into the museum.
The impressing collection had before already made in the Canadian Montreal and in of Paris station.
“All the much more than only beautiful dresses” go, said the director of the arts center, Roger Diederen.
The vision of an open society goes around tolerance, acceptance and.
The exhibits give an idea of that work of the man hardly still which can be grasped, who wrote fashion history, without training to have ever completed.
Chronologically the exhibition is not developed, but it is outstanding choreographed a synthesis of the arts, for which much expenditure was operated: In order to comb the dolls, for example particularly a Stylist was engaged.
14 tons material carted the doers according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Octoberfest still another special participated treat: a leather trousers outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
It was always interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and for humans, who a little different are, Gaultier said.
Also Gaultiers old teddy is to be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the first, timid fashionable going attempts of the designer.
As a child (it was not bad a good pupil and in the football) it tightened, said its teddy BHs and dresses Gaultier.
With a doll to play, its parents would not have permitted him.
He taught himself sketching fashion later then.
He stole fashion magazines and viewed themselves the drafts of other designers, how Gaultier in Munich told.
Later I then however naturally bought.
For its first own fashion show it could not pay the models.
They got nothing, were allowed however the gears to keep.
