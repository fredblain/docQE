Hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with (gilded) the crown of thorns is one of major works, which Otmar Alt for its Bible painted.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar alto Bible, which appeared now with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated its completely personal interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motives.
Its “language” with multicolored colors and fantasyful forms received to the 75-year old - which however is not by any means equivalent with “hilarious” pictures.
On the contrary: The respective topics adapted, that can work quite quite darkly.
Approximately three years Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project, for which he met an subjective-artistic selection from the many subjects area of the “book of all books”.
Developed cycles, which dedicate themselves to topics such as crossroad, troubles, requirements or Lord's Prayers.
Thus it fascinated spontaneously directly several partners: That is valid for the Luther publishing house with its theological adjustment just like for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books.
And there above all the author is Klaus Altepost, who argued on basis of the painting with the respective Bible places.
It interpreted and in such a way into today, into current connections “translated” the Bible places selected by Otmar Alt.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of alto painting.
Embedded they are between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and in each case a set of the artist, who formulates its completely personal thoughts on the respective situation here.
The jewelry cover has golden type characters.
Thus the 75-year old permits equivalent doubly a deep insight of its soul, its emotions.
That is a high degree at intimacy.
Emotions were in the long run at all triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode born and in Berlin grown up, comes from a family, which belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter medal.
“There the education happened already with cane”, remembers Otmar Alt.
“I tried to regenerate around me perhaps also again with the Mr. Vater to stand”.
Its second request is to help the art in fast moving time again to more value: “The perception of picture worlds is today coined of advertisement, and those is loud.
Symbolism is displaced there.
Artists have another desire and Wonne to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
“In this regard I am a dinosaur”.
Otmar Alt would like to let it affect that the viewers “fall themselves” into the pictures leave, itself, discovers and to feel, which strength her to have: “The picture looks for itself its opposite”.
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday with the presentation of the Otmar alto Bible in the Otmar alto foundation, “always” a lover of Otmar Alts's art to have been: “I like, like he with its pictures lives understand”.
Old not paid attention to seize the Bible completely but selected, the also mysterious topics important for it.
“That was not co-operation on eye level”, says old person post office: “Here it concerns the pictures, the text described only”. Developed a picture Bible.
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publishing house this work is an invitation to deepen “its life and find freedom”.
Otmar Alts's pictures (Biblical) the language of the love and those speak the responsibility for Möhler both.
A part that originals - paper and canvas pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition, which is opened on 15 November in the Otmar alto foundation.
