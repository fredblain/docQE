The free voters demand the attitude of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high refugee numbers.
A party head and party Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the L.G.-Herbstklausur in large embankment city before a heavy crisis at of Bavaria schools, if there are for the many new pupils not according to new teachers: “We need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect, around the schools the collapse”, said Aiwanger.
“Otherwise we are gotten distortions in the Bavarian education system.”
The parliamentary group in the Landtag of the free voters meets until Friday in the under-Frankish municipality.
Actually completely different main topics were intended.
But the record number of the refugees dominates now also the free voter meeting.
“Natural will overlay the topic asylum the examination”, said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger demanded the facility of UN protected zones for refugees in Syria, as it during the Yugoslavia wars in the 90's gave.
“In such a way it does not continue, we must to the causes”, said the free voter boss.
Rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters away as fast as possible.
Therefore required Aiwanger also more staff for the Administrative Courts, which are responsible for asylum complaints: “We need also at least 50 new asylum judges”, said Aiwanger.
The L.G.-boss criticized that several Federal states were not consistent: “We needed country widely uniform standards of the Federal states.”
“Bavaria pushes, others away not.”
“There we must become more able to act.”
But the federal state policy in large embankment city is not to fall under the table.
A long-lasting phenomenon for many years remains on the agenda: the educational policy.

But Aiwanger goes not far enough.
“The topic G9 must be accelerated”, said the L.G.-boss.
We demand freedom of election for all High Schools, which want that.
Free trip with the G9 everywhere, where it is wished.
