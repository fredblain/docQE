BBC should give EastEnders up, says former boss of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said, which should stop BBC to send programs such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rival would give “their right arm” for hit shows like Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should be used only in order to make the kind from programs to, which are not sent by other UK-transmitters.
He criticized the BBC for the fact that her public programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience to place into hard disputed time windows against popular shows of their rivals and from transmitters such as BBC4.
After the BBC general manager, Tony Hall, said, who wanted to do enterprise more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that it had tried six years long in its time with Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC into contact.
“I have problems with the idea that BBC gives or sends programs in order, which were shown also clearly by not subsidized rivals”, said Johnson the upper house communication committee in the framework of its investigation about the future of the BBC.
If you liked to hold the broadcast fee, what I central or on a long-term basis for a good idea to hold, one should not its production at least on programs, which do not make or in order give others.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window, because they want to achieve as broad a support for their future as possible.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this, is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is naturally nonsense.
Johnson said: “I do not see, why a regressive tax finances programs, which could be financed also without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly other channels were said their to right arm for it to give.
I strive to see, how this public television is to be.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC debt at the hunt for evaluations was “because of the ambitions of humans, who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way, around long-term support to secure.”
Its comments on popular transmissions the BBC show that, which the former leader of Sky, Tony Ball, in its MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh suggested in the year 2003 that the BBC should sell shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs should go “to BBC4, where one cannot measure rather the audience, but they fulfill their tasks, and they cannot argue, if they go to radio licence fees on their hypocritical missions to the justification from 4 billion £, “now, naturally, we have all these obscure programs provided, the anybody saw.”
They put it into a time window, in which nobody wanted to ever see them.
To the broadcast fee Johnson said to the committee: “I request you to find a rather regressive system regarding conditions who can obtain the best value from this.
Naturally you think all, think we everything the fact that one obtains a large value for 150 £ per year here, but for people, which is for the 150 £ a quantity money, ask me whether is correct, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5-boss of David Elstein, who stated also before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC was to examine their Reithian mission to inform “to form and maintain”.
He said, only little of BBC production officially as education was classified now - he said that 1% of its TV-production and 0.1% were in the radio - and them should take themselves in the public television stations in Australia and Canada an example this to change in “inform, clear up and maintain”.
To the question of the partnerships said Elstein, the BBC should do more within ranges like those of the PROMs, of which he that only one handful said it is on TV shown and with which commercial transmitters alliances are received, in order all online to make available.
