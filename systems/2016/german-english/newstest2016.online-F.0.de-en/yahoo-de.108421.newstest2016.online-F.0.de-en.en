European Union wants to double mercury limit in robbery fish
The European commission wants the limits for mercury in large robbery fish to double and to the consumers thereby a clearly higher dose of the nerve poison expect.
The consumer association Foodwatch, which is present an appropriate paper of the European Union, criticized the plans sharply: “Risks and side effects of missed industrie and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant woman and infants”, explained Matthias Wolfschmidt von Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt the limits of the nerve poison for large fish are to be raised in the end the food chain as for instance shark or sword fish for “politico-economic reasons” of one to two milligrams mercury per kilogram fish.
Large robbery fish are however already today so strongly burdening with mercury that on basis of the still valid limits about 50 percent of the catches may not be sold.
After duplication of the limits then only 14.5 percent would be unsalable.
In response for this loosening the European Union wants to intensify the limits according to Foodwatch with other fish from at present 0.5 milligrams on 0,1 milligrams mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this however “trick”, because smaller Friedfi is usually so low burdening, as for instance carps that they keep the planned maximum values already today.
The sinking with small fish is therefore “a perfidious diverting manoeuvre, which helps alone the economy”, explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal high-poisonous for humans, which enriches itself over the food chain particularly in robbery fish strongly.
The Federal Government warns therefore of the fact that “already small quantities can particularly cause with unborn damages of the nervous system”.
The Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage regarding the valid maximum values however that a “health endangerment of the population of general” is not to be expected.
Mercury arrives particularly by coal combustion into the environment.
The German coal-fired power stations discharge than six tons mercury according to a written information of the Federal Ministry of the Environment to the Represenative of the Green Party in the parliament Annalena Baerbock more in the year, two thirds of the total quantity emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish for instance in Elbe, Rhine and Danube is “permanently and surface covering exceeded”, the “mirror” in March of the paper had quoted.
Last year European-wide warnings of mercury in fish already ranked among the most frequent announced health risks in the European Union-warning system RASFF.
