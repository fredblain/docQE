Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The local council Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And it made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar plant.
Planning for the long desired building of gymnasia at the Bernrieder sport area advances step by step: In the youngest session of the district council the prepared building application without large discussions was unanimously blessed.
Before the committee among other things still another request for a build-legal “exception” respectively “liberation” from the valid development plan had decided.
With the “exception” it went around permission for a special form concerning the roof structure.
Therefore a “saddle roof with non-centric roofridge and roof projection” is to be established.
Background of planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar plants: “By it we get a marvelously large south roof together”, explained mayors Josef Steigenberger in the meeting.
During the “liberation” it concerned again the roof pitch, which was to be for energetic reasons - differently than prescribed in the development plan - below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is reduced clearly thereby.
A “liberation” became necessary, because the development plan does not permit “exceptions” concerning the roof pitch - whereby the Bernrieder local council usually proceeds with petitions for liberation rather restrictively.
With the building of gymnasia it concerns however no recurring project: “We create thereby no precedent”, thus Steigenberger.
The building of gymnasia at the sports center is a community project of the community and the SV Bernried.
At costs are euros taken into account approximately 2.3 million.
Subsidies are expected by the school and popular sport promotion.
In the next process step the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is submitted now to the district administration office for examination.
