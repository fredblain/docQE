Rosbergs only foreign exchange: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton only a foreign exchange in the fight for the WM-title in the formula: “Full attack”.
WM-second stressed before the start into the crucial seven overseas running, “that I nothing more to lose has”.
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night running into Singapore on this Sunday from titleholder and two-fold champion Hamilton.
The Britisher won already seven of the past twelve season running and takes the floodlight Grand Prix likewise in the city state as favorite in attack.
2009 and last year could win the 30 years old Britisher a running.
Whether the present smog in the city state will have influence on the large price of Singapore, is still unclear.
For days a vapor bell over the city hangs, released by fires on the neighbour island Sumatra.
