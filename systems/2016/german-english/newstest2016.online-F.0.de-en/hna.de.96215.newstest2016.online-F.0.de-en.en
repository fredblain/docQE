Terraced houses for refugees, single parent, low income earner
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for humans, who do not have much money in the Middle Franconian corner valley.
Thus approximately for refugees - in addition, as signal: “Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but likewise the single mother and the low income earners.”
“I show, as one also today well to still favorably and build can”, say to the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees become on the housing market urge.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know, how rapidly favorable dwelling can be created: He builds terraced houses for refugees in a project.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees become on the housing market urge.
Which solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or gymnasia does not have sustainability.
Because humans remain to a large part here.
In view of the stream of refugees we need sufficient dwelling also in the next decades.
A completely banal, three-story terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs at few the place.
It facilitates the integration.
That is different, if one accommodates humans in blocks of flats.
Everyone of the six houses, which are built straight in the pilot project, consists of three housing units for in each case four asylum seekers.
Each housing unit has two bedrooms, a bath, a kitchen and a lounge.
It can be that many refugees will say, it is again peace, I decreases.
Then the houses can be converted easily after the respective needs.
Are the costs how high?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184,000 euros, without property.
That is visible.
Six months the building took.
That is appropriate.
Did the construction specifications their plans complicate?
Gildner: Building-legally I pulled my project through correctly.
It always makes the threatening sword of Damocles special's building and the parking bay regulation particularly complicated.
Gruesome one.
It is still subordinated, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three parking bays.
Only in the cities for it the place is missing.
And refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the adjacents resident react to their terraced house project?
Gildner: It gave which, has me accused those to create buildings of luxuries for asylum seekers.
Which is not correct definitely.
But you do not intensify the competition around payable apartments?
Gildner: True is nevertheless: We had a boom of construction activity in Germany in the last five years, but were built luxury dwellings, which hardly one can afford more.
My project has the message, also normal humans needs dwelling.
Not only refugees, but likewise the single mother or the low income earners.
I show, how one can build also still today favorably and well.
Therefore it goes.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro-system technology in Regensburg and concerned themselves first with environmental analyses.
