Angela Merkel and the refugee politics: “We create”
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - which is a Federal Chancellor decided to accept her.
What comes to Germany?
Approximately 800,000 asylum seekers will come to prognoses of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in this year to Germany, to statement of vice-chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) are Germany even in the layer, one million refugees to be taken up.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge determination: “I say again and again: We can create that, and we create”.
Which comes to Germany, mediate the following overview.
Are used after different prognoses between 350000 (estimation of the Federal Department of Construction) and 400000 (estimation the Pestel institute) apartments annually - the next five years long.
That is nearly twice as much, as before is built (250000 apartments).
Dramatic the lack of dwelling is however particularly with payable renting objects: Falls out annually 60000 to 80000 subsidized low-rent housings of rent control, and around these particularly favorable apartments also refugees will apply.
Federal Secretary of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to therefore double the promotion, from at present 518 million on a billion euro.
Much too little is from view of the Pestel institute: 80,000 subsidized low-rent housings annually would have to develop and but would have the federation a promotion at a value of 6.4 billion per year to invest.
United itself scientists and Federal Secretary of Construction are in the fact that it must give in addition more tax benefits for investments to housebuilding.
According to estimations of the institute for job market and occupation research is to be assumed on a long-term basis 55 percent of the fleeing in Germany can be gainfully employed.
However the refugees in Germany were not asked at all systematically for their qualification, in order to help them with the entrance, criticize Claudia Walter, Projektmanagerin for integration and education in the Bertelsmann foundation.
For the integration of refugees it is however crucial whether they find in Germany work.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the admission company, in addition, for the self-esteem of the immigrants, migration researcher says Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany it gave a political turn according to Thränhardt: of the work prohibition for refugees for the acknowledgment of work.
While there was in former times a work prohibition for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced in November 2014 to three months, just as the residence obligation, which limits asylum seekers to a residence.
In the society - also because of the lack of specialist - by the majority the aspect became generally accepted that faster the entrance to the job market should be made possible for refugees.
A large hurdle for the entrance to the job market are missing German knowledge.
So far there is still no sufficient offer at general and occupational language courses.
In addition investigations show that jobs are obtained most frequently by personal contacts.
The structure of networks is therefore in opinion of Thränhardt Königsweg for work integration.
It determined the citizens of Berlin school administration that only few fled parents give their children to the day-care centers, roughly ten to 15 percent: “For uprooted parents it is for a start completely important to hold the family together”, says Ilja Koschembar, Sprecher for youth and family in the citizens of Berlin senate administration.
In order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the day-care center, the administration distributes handbills in different languages.
If the need of educators should rise by the large number at refugees strongly, the citizen of Berlin senate would try to increase the training capacities - about, by permitting more technical schools.
In the countries pupils without German knowledge are prepared in welcome classes for instruction.
They are informed however not always by fully trained teachers and teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by instructors, who have only one qualification into German as second language.
At them no lack exists, says Beate Stoffers of the citizens of Berlin school administration.
The German student council estimates that in Germany want to study about 20 percent of the refugees.
In principle no Federal state asylum seekers forbids or waited the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, Senator of the Interiors Frank Henkel (CDU) its attitude now however gave up.
The entrance to the university could be facilitated for study-willing refugees.
Because refugees with a residence permission or a tolerance get no more achievements after the asylum seeker achievement law, if they begin a study.
The latters get in principle no student financial assistance scheme, since they do not fall under the circle of student financial assistance scheme-entitled people.
Waited refugees must have lived so far four years in Germany, in order to be student financial assistance scheme entitled, from 1 January 2016 on shorten this span on 15 months.
Also this financing gap must be closed however, demands Steffen Krach, of Berlin Secretary of State for science, and the German student council.
The studying should get student financial assistance scheme immediately.
The Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many the religion is an important component of their identity.
The state should grant gradually the same rights as it the churches to have, and which existing state church right further to a new state religion relationship develop to the Islam.
Important would be also the establishment of an Islamic welfare organisation, which worries professionally about the newcomers.
To the rights also obligations belong.
So must agree the representatives the Islam on clear contacts and be ready to co-operate and to it certain controllability grant with the state in many ranges.
In addition also the readiness belongs to proceed courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern, religious conflicts on Thursday could also to Germany be carried in.
Those, which wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany, “are immediately their right to stay here in Germany, incurred the loss”, said it in the Bavarian broadcast.
It suggested translating the Basic Law on Arab.
Integration will be in the future much more still than today a topic of the whole society.
Thus also the majority society will have themselves to change, becomes the dismantling of discrimination and racism urgent.
Germany has - as result of European decisions - since a scarce decade an anti-discrimination place and a general Equality Act.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series of murders showed, in which police and authorities the racist motive systematically ignored.
Resemble opportunities for all: Which migrant organizations demand and the groups of interests of not-white Germans for a long time and to which international agreements like the anti-racism convention to Germany commit, reality must become in the next years, if the country to remain peaceful and its new citizens and citizen its possibilities to use be supposed - for the well-being of all.
Generally Germany is capable of supplying the refugees expected so far medically means physician president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“Which concerns one power and capacities, creates we”, said it Tagesspiegel.
However for it extra money must flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands, to hand all Ankömmlingen out equal with the registration health cards.
Furnished achievements could be accounted for later with the Federal states.
And it is most doubtful on a long-term basis to fob off so many humans with the limited service catalog which the asylum seeker achievement law plans.
Otherwise above all the language barriers make for the physicians to create.
Already so far, then the citizens of Berlin health female scientist Thea Borde proved, Migranten more badly over their diseases were cleared up than other patients.
Only in hospitals, also in medical practices interpreter costs would not have to be taken over, demand them.
Would be helped many refugees in addition, already with more general-medical refuges in the emergency outpatient clinics.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children about give it clearly more untreated handicaps, and with the young people go it around HIV clearing-up.
With the partial other symptoms German physicians from their training would cope however, mean Montgomery.
“Parasite infestation or tuberculosis is not so difficult to recognize”. And which concerns the lack of physician, possibly even alleviation is in view by the refugees.
The Syrians would have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even physicians.
In order to be allowed, would have they however their qualification practice to prove and possibly again to examinations placings.
At least half of the refugees arriving at Germany is according to estimations of the federal psychotherapist chamber (BPtK) psychologically suffer: Most suffer from a post office-traumatic load disturbance or from depressions.
Particularly vulnerable is refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, Präsident of the BPtK.
A recently published study DO Munich proven that each fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumatized at Germany.
Who is gotten sick with a post office-traumatic load disturbance, suffers among other things from so-called flashbacks with difficulty in breathing, fraud, tachycardia and fears of death.
Further symptoms are sleep and concentration disturbances, strong unpleasantness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent that the symptoms became chronic, it is necessary an early treatment, explained Munz.
So far received however only four percent that psychologically refugees a psychotherapy suffer.
Psychologically ill asylum-seekers in the welfare agencies can place a request for a psychotherapy, but last the treatment usually several months.
Besides specialists or physicians, who are not trained for the psychological illnesses, became mostly decide in the welfare agencies whether a therapy was necessary or not.
This leads frequently to false estimates, says Munz.
