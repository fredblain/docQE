Konrad in the search for 35.000 winterproof accomodation
Konrad has to do all hands with the refugee accommodation fully.
Christian Konrad is used to it that its word has weight.
The government used the earlier powerful Raiffeisen banker, in order to set up accomodation for the thousands the refugees.
The chaos in the Erstaufnahmezentrum Traiskirchen already got Konrad into the grasp.
“We have no more homeless people in Traiskirchen”, reported it of its first success.
Also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, who had come on Monday to Austria, took place without large eddy, said Konrad and praised the organizational “master achievement”.
The ministry of the Interior spoke however of a “crisis-charged situation”.
Altogether Konrad counts on a need of 85.000 accomodation in this year's year.
In order to fulfill the number, still 35,000 accommodation must be found in the next weeks - 20,000 is to make the countries, to 15,000 available the federation.
If it should become more refugees, we can create it.
“However it is not a barrel without ground”, said Konrad.
With the national main people it already held conversations.
These would have assured to it to create also still for the coming refugees accomodation.
“In upper Austria it runs well”, said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-authorized agent supports Konrad.
Tomorrow it will give a meeting with cardinal Christoph Schönborn, is to be clarified, how the church will help.
The asylum co-ordinator sets large expectations also into the ORF action “helping as we”.
On the platform private people can offer accommodation uncomplicatedly.
Besides one hopes for hotels, which stand in the winter empty.
Konrad and Maier criticized yesterday the standards for the accommodation as “very highly”.
In times of distress it cannot be that accomodation givers must keep a certain height of the towel racks or size of the upperlight.
For a limited time “emergency standards” would have to be valid.
The fact that it is more successful with the accommodation contrary to the ministry of the Interior justifies Konrad with its experience.
I am an older gentleman, to who one does not say the untruth so easily in the face.
Persuasive power is its most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause costs for the republic, how they explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three to four.
The own accomodation search was so far not yet successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan place as office.
But there are obviously problems with approval.
Linz demands a better allocation
For the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as hint arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees plans the city Linz.
This is momentarily not necessarily, since one can accommodate the concerning at present without these measures, says mayors Klaus Luger (FR).
For the emergency however further locations are to be checked for their fitness.
Criticism practices the city boss at the allocation of the refugees within the Federal state.
Also different districts must make their contribution here.
