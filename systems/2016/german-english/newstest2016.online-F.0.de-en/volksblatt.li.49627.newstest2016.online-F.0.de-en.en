First foehn tower, then salient cold front
At the coming night the foehn breaks through in the valleys of the alpine north side, as Meteoschweiz communicated on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and at the night to Thursday the foehn partly blows with storm strength by the foehn valleys.
After blow-drying on Thursday morning a salient cold front, which strengthens rainfalls, gusts of wind and a temperature decrease brings, crosses us.
As MeteoNews in a report writes, Switzerland lies at present on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British islands in a strong southwest current.
On the alpine north side the foehn breaks by the valleys at the night to Wednesday.
In the consequence the foehn blows until Thursday mornings in the foehn valleys with gusts isolated from 60 to 100 km/h, and particularly in the Urnerland partly also over 100 km/h.
The foehn can penetrate in the adjacent midland in parts, and on the mountains even gale gusts from over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy foehn provides for summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity at the alpine south tendency to back-ups begins itself.
Here rain begins, which continues until Thursday evening.
In sum south the alps in the next 48 hours on over 100 litres rains per square meter, this must be partly counted after in the last days already large rain quantities is fallen.
On Thursday morning the foehn air goes out, in the consequence rolls a cold front with strong, partly thundery implemented rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Together with the cold front the wind refurbishes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decrease clearly.
The following days present themselves in the north autumnal with 15 to 20 degrees, in the south however become it on the weekend sunnier and more warmly with up to 25 degrees.
