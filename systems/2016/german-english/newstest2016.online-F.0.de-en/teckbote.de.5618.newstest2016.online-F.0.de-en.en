The goal is it, each age group into the spell of fascinating acrobatics to pull animal dressages and unique entertainment.
Now loads the Circus rehearse into the manege on the Ziegelwasen for dreaming.
“Our passion is the circus.”
“I cannot introduce myself, without my circus family to live”, say Stephanie Probst, Tierlehrerin and Juniorchefin.
“Passion” - under this slogan the current manege production stands.
Already for more than 33 years the circus is in the hands of the family rehearses.
The gift for inspiring is appropriate for the family thus in the blood.
“It is important to us to fetch away and carry forward it for two hours into completely different world humans of their daily grind”, stresses the 27-year old junior boss.
“Manege cocktail with metropolitan city flair”, then calls director Reinhard Probst its concept.
50 cities on that scarcely 3,000 kilometers long tour can experience this flair now.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from around the world.
Distinguished with the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown Family draws the audience with joke and charm into its spell.
Also Castillo Brother understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take up the Cuban duo loosely.
Ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art at the mast is to take by storm woman hearts.
Except through numerous bursts of laughter acrobatics of the Circus fascinate rehearse also with intuitive feeling and articulatedness.
With a wheel on a ball balance?
For He Yuan no problem.
Contortionists fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is with the oldest form of acrobatics trusts like few different and fascinated with her mobility.

“The animals belong to our family”, stress Stephanies mother, Brigitte Probst.
Drawbacks in the attitude of circus animals are only too often topic with different animal rights groups.
Stephanie Probst takes also in addition position: “Are our animals not well, do not go it also to us not well”.
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each Streicheleinheit.
The “four-legged kindists”, how they are affectionately called, after possibility each desire is read off from the eyes.
We want to co-operate with the animals and with them let us joke have.
If the animal feels not well, it does not want also into the manege.
The highest requirement thus: well for the animals provide.
Particularly on their Zebroid jumbo jet, a mixture from a Shetland pony stud and a zebra mare, is the family rehearses proudly.
The two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing passed.
“Nevertheless then, suddenly, was our small jumbo jet there”, tells Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not yet ready for the manege, however it is the singular little mascot of the Circus rehearses.
For each visitor might be thus somewhat thereby.
“Unity is safe”, says Stephanie Probst: “All the same whether five or 1 of,200 spectators, we give always our best and is with whole heart thereby”.
