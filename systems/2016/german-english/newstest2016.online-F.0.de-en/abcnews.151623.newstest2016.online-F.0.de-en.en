8 poll ratings, which show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some tried to brand it as flop.
Others shrugged off it than a joke.
And some wait for a collapse.
But no matter, as some republicans try, to Donald Trump of upper ranks with surveys to pull downward, it (still) did not function.
Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two digit range lead, and some began to ask oneself seriously what for the opportunities of the nomination of the real estate Moguls means it.
Naturally it is still too early in the electoral period.
None states that Trump will probably win the republican nomination.
Experts stress that at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys's guidance was transferred to ascending Herman Cain, from whom no only a state during the nomination process won.
And there are many reasons, why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's super PAC and the conservative branch of economic activity club for Growth recognize now Trumps staying power and begin to let their dollar flow in order to fall it.
Here are some current poll ratings, which point to the fact that the real estate Mogul is not only a temporary phase:
Trumps of popularity values 180 degrees.
Briefly before Donald Trump announced its candidacy in the middle of June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed that only two of ten republicans positively saw the real estate Mogul.
To in the middle of July there was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August were there 52 percent.
Now six of 10 republicans have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.
About three of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers hold themselves in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa stated last week that 60 percent of the republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two thirds of the GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey of CNN/ORC last week said 67 percent of the republicans, they would be enthusiastically” or “content” either “, if Trump were nominated.
Only two of 10 say, they would be “annoyed”, if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates approximately the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say, they would be “enthusiastically” vs. 40 percent, which said the same about Trump).
The next in things enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other side it says 47 percent of the republican voters that they would be dissatisfied” or “annoyed” “, if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, became the candidate.
A majority of the republicans does not see Trumps temperament as problem.
While Donald Trump is criticized far away for his bombastic and insulting statements, thus ABC News/Washington Post believe 52 percent the Irish voter that the real estate Mogul has the correct temperament for a president, tending to the republicans, on Monday.
The same number is valid for the Federal State Iowa in the first preselection state of the nation, where the same 52 percent of the republicans it thinks that he has the personality for a commander in chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless it thinks 44 percent that he does not have the personality, in order to implement effectively its office, and of 10 independent ones say that its temperament does not fit into the white house, thus ABC/post office to nearly six.
Republican voters get accustomed to the idea.
If they put their scholar hats on, Trump consider republican voter material.
If they are asked, who wins earliest the GOP nomination, it says four after a survey of CNN/ORC from the past week of ten that Trump is the best bet.
That is a change for the time, when four of ten at the end of July set their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this time in the last cycle four thought from ten republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination opposite only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
It shows up nevertheless that Trumps campaign view a variety of GOP voters as plausible.
Even if the republicans collected themselves around another candidate, Trump strikes still nearly everyone.
Some experts point out that the splintered field probably contributes to Trumps guidance, while the anti Trump support is vaguely distributed on more than one dozen of other candidates.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of Septembers shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other republican candidates, Trump harvests the majority support.
It has 13 points lead, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Carly Fiorina before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It is a neck-and-neck race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate, who strikes it?
Ben Carson would overhaul the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race.
A limited majority of Donald Trump fans says that they formed their opinion.
A new survey of CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the voters, who support Trump say that they assigned their voices firmly.
Naturally can happen much, in order to change, and nobody can really say to never change the opinion.
It said 46 percent that they leave the door open, in order to change to other candidates.
Nevertheless Trumps is strongest competition for the moment the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters, who say that they formed their opinion, are twice as frequently for Trump.
Six of 10 republicans say that they agree with Trump with the topic immigration.
Since then Donald Trump in its election campaign speech two months ago immigrants from Mexico “rapist” called, was the immigration trick and pivot in the public discourse to 2016.
Some it are anxious that the bombastic mode of expression will keep crucial hispanic away from Trump from the republican party and will damage the re-orientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/post office survey of Monday six say of 10 republicans that they agree with Trump with questions of the immigration.
As long as thus the immigration remains in the footlights, it will apparently also do to Donald Trump.
Frustration over the government climbs on new highest levels.
To Donald Trump and Ben Carson is allotted meanwhile approximately half of the support of republican voters, particularly by its outsider status.
Six of 10 republicans say in the new on Mondays survey of ABC/post office, it want rather a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they are also furious on Washington.
A survey of the Moines register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three are frustrated by four Iowa republicans over the republicans in the congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “infernally annoyed”.
