Jarryd Hayne had several options, in order to begin its NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed large interest after its move into the USA - and there were many other teams, which sent end of last year requests after its impressing open training day.
But Hayne selected the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like an intelligent decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne for the rest of the play on the bank, when it lost a wrangling in such a way, as it did the Aussie rugby league convert with its first Punt Return on Tuesday with 20-3 the victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted its man and gave to Hayne the next opportunity to a Punt Return and also to the current play after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula showed further its true face in the changing room after the play.
Instead of grinding its Rookies before the rest of the team by the mill, it encouraged it.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in its press conference after the play.
The 49er it sport reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged also by special team co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey, who guessed/advised him to forget its to messed up catch and worry about the next play.

It was not surely the start, which Hayne and its substantial Australian followers for its NFL debut had expected.
Hayne left the playing field after the Fumble swearing and told later the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104,1 that he could not imagine a worse start into his NFL career,
“That was a thing, which occurs just, one worries only about the next play, and that is it,” said Hayne.
Hayne compared the gaffe at that time with its Origin debut in the year 2007, when a passport led with in its own in-Goal range to a Try for Queen country.
Altogether it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27-year old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and holds thereby an Australian flag after the play and postete it on its Instagram.
