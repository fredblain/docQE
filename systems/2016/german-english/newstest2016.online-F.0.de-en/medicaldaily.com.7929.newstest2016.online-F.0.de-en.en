Of Brazil pediatric society Rio Grande nutrition for healthy satisfying promotes
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS tries to clear up in shocking way women over it how importantly good nutrition is during the quiet time. She does this with the presentation of pictures of babies, who suck at breasts, which are painted by unhealthy food with representations.
Mother's milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrats, which give baby all nutrients, which need it, in order to develop a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements pregnant women and young mothers will turn out to increase their daily calorie supply by approximately 500 calories per day.
However new research results point to the fact that a higher calorie supply is not the only diet tables adjustment, which mothers should make.
A current study under the direction of Robert Waterland, professor at the Baylor college OF Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy eating of pregnant women actually concerns the genes of their babies and protects it against the development of tumors.
Unfortunately an unhealthy nutrition of the child can affect the immune system negatively.
