Di Maria meets with its debut in the champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by at Malmö.
Here are the play report and the reaction to the play.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani held course, when Paris Saint Germain started its champions League season with extremely comfortable 2-0 a victory against Malmö in the prince park stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less as four minutes after the start of its champion League debut than PSG player, who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards missed it a set of opportunities, before they increased finally their lead, than Cavani in the 61. Minute a headed goal obtained.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in the group of A needs of Paris a strong start against the Swedish master, there it not only the qualification for the K.O. - Rounds aim at, but an improvement on the way to the quarter finals in everyone of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class play opportunities before the gate, missed by Laurent Blancs's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics. It was replaced later in the play against its hometown team and against the club, with which he already began his illustrious career in the year 1999.
“It is not simple to win at home or outward in the champions League. Therefore it is a good start to win 2:0 to cause for our opponents of problems and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things, which we must still perfect in the course of the season”, said Blanc.
“That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and have we won, although I regret it that we still did not obtain or two further gates.”
Ibrahimovic returned to its injury in one of three changes to the Paris team, which on the weekend a 2:2 standoff could hold on own place against Bordeaux in first division, but it was outdone in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
Argentine wing striker the man it was called who can carry PSG forward on the next stage in Europe, when he was transferred in the last month of Manchester United, and he suggested, why, when he ran in Marco Verrattis's passport behind the Malmö defense, before he locked beautifully past at Johan Wiland into the long corner of the net.
If however someone believed that PSG would obtain a large victory, that was disappointed.
Malmö, which struck Celtic in a play-off, in order to reach this stage, began with Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was deeply in the centre zone lined up with a five-man defense and two a heavy opponent.
But except a shot of Nikola Djurdjic, that far at Kevin Trapps's posts in the 34. Minute passed, offered it little in the attack.
Sometimes instead PSG gave itself up, with some bad passes and bad conclusions, not least from Ibrahimovic, which blundered with not less than five attempts alone in the first half and was given up then, after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless it proved much more fate, if he brought his fellow players in the play, and it was a passport of Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria transformed into a turning shot, which of Wiland in the 52. Minute at the post was by-steered…
The second gate fell finally shortly after the hourly brand owing to Cavani. The Uruguayer obtained thereby its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had up-fished a left flank of Maxwell.
The terminated all thought to the fact that Malmö can return to the play, and only a outstanding intervention of Wiland from shortest distance, in order to stop David Luiz could the final result low keep, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi a gate was in the end denied.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, admitted later that PSG played a class over its team, and the Norwegian said: “Our the latter championsleague play was in December in the last year.
Since then we played only in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualification plays are not sufficient.”
Hat off before Paris!
It was a great play of them!
