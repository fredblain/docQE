For easily overweight diabetics decrease in weight surgery can be helpful.
The advantages of the decrease in weight surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.
It is still too early, in order to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes live after the decrease in weight surgery longer than those, which receive non-surgical treatments.
“The number of deaths data need a long time, in order to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of the decrease in weight surgery, to which a editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery wrote.
Decrease in weight operations or adiposity surgery, use different methods, in order to make the size smaller of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's own ability to take up food.
Over the years adiposity operations proved for the treatment of Typ-2-Diabetes as efficient, but most studies were accomplished with humans, who are higher diseased obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or.
BMI, a certain measure in weight regarding size, is considered as normally between 18,5 and 24,9.
A BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight, and humans with a BMI over 30 are considered as obese.

For the new study the researchers from of Taiwan used min Sheng General hospital data, them since 2007 in a study collected and to compare thereby two kinds of adiposity surgery - stomach bypass and stomach hose formation - for medical treatments for Typ-2-Diabetes with humans, who were easily overweight.
The average BMI under those, which underwent of this operation, was reduced from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile the BMI remained with those, the non-surgical diabetes treatments received approximately directly with 29.
Under those, which underwent to a surgical interference, the diabetes illness separated completely and with 28% partly with 36%.
In the medical-treated group partly separated in the comparison to it the diabetes completely only with a percent and with only about two percent.
Beyond that the results were generally better with controls of the blood pressure, the Triglyceride and “bad” LDL cholesterol “in the 'surgical' group”, found the authors out.
The researchers supervised also the patient blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of the time.
Hemoglobin A1c is held best under 7 percent, writes the researchers.
After the operation average hemoglobin A1c level of approximately 9 percent sank on approximately 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group it remained however stable with approximately 8 percent.
But this better “glykämische control” - how in improved hemoglobin A1c level reflects itself you - the number of deaths did not reduce Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and its colleagues in five years, so the leading researcher.
The research team compared also average results with the two kinds of the surgery.
In the fifth year the bypass surgery group had lost reached larger decreases in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) compared with the gastrectomy group more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), and registered rather a complete overcoming the diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show a survival advantage of the surgery after five years, it gives references from a study of heavier humans in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University OF Arizona, college OF Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study it was with obese humans, who underwent of a adiposity operation, about 29 percent in the course of 15 years to less probably die - compared with a group, which tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show an advantage for surviving with the surgery patients, Blackstone, said was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35, which is interested in the procedure.
“That is the critical point of this study, because she says the fact that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group”, without increased risk of death or, said it to a kidney disease.
Blackstone added that humans and their physicians should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient with its BMI lies between 27 and 30.
“I think that we wait too long, until we bring humans to it this seriously to take”, told them.
I think that as soon as they accumulated these genetic changes, which connected their bodies firmly with obesity and diabetes, are a reversal really heavily.”
