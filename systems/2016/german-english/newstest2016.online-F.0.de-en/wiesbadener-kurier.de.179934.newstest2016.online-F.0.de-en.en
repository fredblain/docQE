It is just as great that small and smallest clubs are there active.
The message “1:0 for a welcome”, which we spent, is lived in the football.
“That is of enormous importance”, said it.
In this and the next year the federation makes in each case 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government.
