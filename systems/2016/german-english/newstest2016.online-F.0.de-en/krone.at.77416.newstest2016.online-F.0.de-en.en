Croatia: “We leave the refugees through”
“Now the border controls are raised also at our southern borders”, said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
Controls at the Hungarian border remain upright parallel to it.
Still it is clear that everyone, which wants to place a request for asylum can make also this “natural”.
The supply and security of humans are the center of attention.
Is clear in addition, “that it clear signals needs”, said the minister.
Humans must know that we do not accept boundless migration stream, also not about the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers “passage” - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had communicated before, also Slovenia wanted arriving refugees toward Austria and Germany further-travels to leave and perhaps also passages for the refugees to establish.
This Minister of the Interior did not see Vesna Györkös Znidar completely in such a way in loaf oh however.
The idea of passages is “absolutely unacceptable”, Slovenia rather the monitoring of the border - particularly to Hungary - will intensify.
The border with Croatia is however already strongly controlled as external border of the Schengen area.
How the minister stressed, Slovene thereby does not want to block its borders for refugees however.
“Each EU member must fill out its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function”, to stressed Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government communicated, the first refugees would have already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to enter in east Croatia the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid past in order to evade to the registration.
The Croatian police could take up it in the close corn fields.
According to local media since then constantly police vehicles with new refugees arrive in the Croatian Tovarnik.
Among them numerous women and children predominantly concern Syrians and Afghans.
Also emergency services and the red cross already are in the use.
In the coming days count his country on approximately 4000 refugees, said Ministers of the Interior Ranko Ostojic.
Besides buses from Presevo at the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had brought so far Migranten to the Hungarian border, were rerouted direction Croatia, reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday agreeing.
The government in Belgrade denied however that it was it, humans instructs to hit certain routes: “Neither we can, nor we want to do this”, it were said.
According to the media reports in the early a first bus arrived with approximately 50 refugees in the Serbian border town Sid, in the course of the day further buses was expected anyhow.
Over Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The passengers had been the whole night of that approximately 500 kilometers of removed Macedonian border by Serbia on the way.
“We heard that Hungary closed, therefore to us the police said that we are to drive”, said to one of the refugees here.
They wanted to travel by Croatia, Slovenia and Austria further to Germany.
Thus it could actually come now to observers shift of the past Balkans route Turkey Greece Macedonia Serbia Hungary already predicted to a somewhat far distance lain west.
Croatia: “Comprehensive possibilities for the border control”
Of Croatia before Ministers of the Interior Ostojic it had stressed that its country had prepared corresponding plans for the case of a strong inflow of refugees for possible exceptional cases.
It did not call details, it referred however on the fact that Croatia had comprehensive possibilities for the border control” as a non--Schengen member “.
One would drive through strict controls, around itself qualify for the membership in the Schengen area too.
Slovenia belongs to this since 2007, which issues EU partners the country since then throughout a good certification, which concerns the standard of the border controls.
On Serbian side further about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports they would have spent the past night at the border crossing Horgos, which leads after Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain further completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to further-travel now to the Croatian border, is still unclear.
The Serbian Minister of the Interior Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to still calm down Wednesday-early with a local inspection in Horgos: It hold the debates over alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is closed now, for prematurely.
It would not concern very high refugee numbers at present.
One cannot say yet whether they would continue their travel over Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Aides guess/advise dangerous - alternative routes to Migranten
However private Hungarian refugee aides began already to distribute to the refugees maps on which alternative routes are drawn in by Croatia.
The border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless however: In parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia war yet not vacated mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team was sent by mine circular scrapers in the border area.
