Seehofer: “Borders are not blocked”
In a longer telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) governor Josef Pühringer (VP) made a settlement the further action in the refugee question on Monday.
Seehofer insured me that the German borders are not blocked.
The onward journey of refugees into the Federal Republic is further possible.
However give it thereby now just the appropriate border controls.
It will more give special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being none.
The protection-looking for were brought however with regular courses to Germany.
From the other EU member states Pühringer called once more intensified solidarity in the refugee question.
The fact that now also Austria at its borders introduces again controls is for Pühringer “a logical consequence” from the action of the Germans.
