Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Ridiculous 21 years young, a linnet with upper-fancy Frise.
The type with the platinum-blond hair is 100 million euros heavily.
Rather even more.
At present Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation U17 revs up.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year old did not hear the name “Ritz Carlton” ever.
Not badly.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock however sits in the morning the Polin on the cold flagstones before the citizen of Berlin luxury hotel at the Potsdamer place.
The Bieber building: Here their idol, whose hang poster in droves in Szczecin, lives for Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much on the day, as its mummy earns Ewa in the half year.
If at all.
Those says: “Actually my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the High School.”
“I fulfill a dream” to it.
Compulsory schooling?
Whom juckt's?
The fans not.
Also Bieber themselves not.
That out-ensured anyway.
For the advertisement in the advertising hiatus of the Superbowls it took three million, a two-yearly deal with an anti-pimple company rinsed many, many dollar on the Bieber account.
And with each doll, which looks as he and over the counter goes, takes Bieber likewise.
If Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, one is astonished at the windowpane.
More it is to have carried off than 100 million in such a way.
Some say, hype would go too far.
Others stress, Bieber are final straight in the USA and Great Britain with its new single “What DO you mean?” at place 1.
Bieber themselves, whose fourth album is to follow in November, do not interest the many zeros for a start.
At least he does in such a way.
