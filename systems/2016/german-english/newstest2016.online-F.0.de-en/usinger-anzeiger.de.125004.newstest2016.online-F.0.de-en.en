Space probe “Cassini” finds ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of the Saturn moon Enceladus a global ocean sloshes.
Researchers conclude from observations of the space probe “Cassini”.
Therefore the moon tumbles easily on its course around the ring planet.
This dutch roll is only small, but nevertheless too large for a continuous firm heavenly body, it means in a report of the Cornell university in Ithaca (U.S. state New York) of Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the trade paper “Icarus”.
Already longer it was well-known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of Enceladus.
Thus “Cassini” had discovered already 2006 ice volcanos at the South Pole of the Saturn moon, the water vapour and ice particle to spit and thus the so-called E-ring the Saturns to feed.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, closed the astronomers at that time.
The expansion of the hidden ocean was not clarified however.
