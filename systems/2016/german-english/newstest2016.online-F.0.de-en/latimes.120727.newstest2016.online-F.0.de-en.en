On their to most expected conference in the year Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week approximately around a 27-Fuß Honduras Mahagoni table sitting, in order to decide, whether it is time, to raise for the first time for nearly one decade the key interest.
Threateningly over them at an end of the decorated, two-floor meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a memory to the fact that the Fed chairmen Janet L. Yellen and its colleagues before all other things is to set the economic interests of the nation.
The central bank has a double order of the congress: Maximization of the US-occupation and prices here keep stable.
But since the large recession the Fed recognized leaders that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could the X-factor in a decision is, which is too close, in order to predict it. It will be cured on Thursday announced, whether the U.S. economy is ready for launch, by the unprecedented incentive by the close short term interest rate which is because of zero since end of 2008.
Although most data of the economy show the fact that them grow solidly could make the recent turbulences at the global financial markets the already careful Fed representatives fearful to strengthen this volatility by the rise of the interest for government securities - and is it only around for quarters a percentage point.
“Obvious will be the job market and the inflation primarily the most important, which they observe, said” Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin with the brokerage firm Stifel Nico louse & CO.
“However I think, if they were in the search for a pretext, for not increasing the interest rate am the increased uncertainty approximately around the global market enough justification, further to wait”, said her.
There is no consent over it, which will do the Fed, what actually the financial market disconcerted.
About half of the economists, who were asked recently by Bloomberg, to have an increase in interest this week predicted.
The financial markets expect however a awaiting of the Fed, with a key indicator, which only an opportunity shows 30% on an increase.
This points to a decrease of the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless the strategists reduce the impact, by promising that a further increase is far distant.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average value jumped around 228,89 points or around 1,4% on 16.599, 85.
The action by expectations released that the Fed politics maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, Chefökonom with Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise, if the Fed would lift the sentences at this time”, said it.
If she does it, “she would have to go in her explanation very far, in order to calm down the financial markets, thereby her in panic did not turn out.”
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets down, because it would eliminate the uncertainty over it, when the Fed will act.
Still one month ago the Fed seemed on good way to increase the sentence by 0,25 percentage points in this month the first small step in a slow aggravation of the monetary conditions, which the strength of the recovery in the USA would test.
Yellen in spring and in the early summer had said that she expects an increase of the sentence in this year despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be necessary.
Although the job creation slowed down in August, the improvement on the job market was solid in this year.
The unemployment ratio sank on 5,1% in the past month, the lowest for more than seven years and in the proximity of the level, which the Fed views as full employment.
Increases of wages showed signs of a recovery.
And although the inflation constantly ran under the full year target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the principal reason was the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices.
The economy “can master higher interest rates and needs it because of the strain on the job market”, said Ian Shepherdson, executive economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world winced end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average value fell in May around more than 16% under its highest level, than investors feared that a slowing down of the Chinese economy global growth would throttle.
The market recovered in this month something, whereby the Dow is now around nearly 10% under the high from May.
For the Fed representatives the market turbulences affect the complex calculation, when one is to increase the interest.
“If the events on the financial markets and the news over the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have arisen to Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve Bank in the last few weeks, them in this meeting the reins would tighten”, said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman center for.
Now it forecasts that she will wait at least one month, in order the effects better into the grasp to get.
“There is a quantity uncertainty over it, which the effects will be on the U.S. economy, and there are nearly no reliable data, which describe the developments in China,” said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not of the main objectives of the Fed, therefore it should not be included technically during her decision making.
But eventually the Fed became currency authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank was enormous in the last years.
The bare reference of the leader at that time Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013 that the Fed “narrows” its monetary expansion could, released confusion around the globe.
In a world, in which markets and national economies are increasingly intertwined with one another, it can be expected by the Fed representatives that they do not only supervise the developments in other place, but itself also with other central banks and experts in an advisory manner, in order to receive a better understanding for the global economy.
Their decision making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, Leiter of the global strategy for the fortune management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, Präsident of Federal Reserve bank OF Richmond, VA., noticed this month that “the Fed has a history of over reactions to financial market movements, those with apparently not with the economical fundamental data is linked.”
Lacker, enfranchised member of the federal open Market Committee, de for an increase in interest uses itself, quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower their key interest around 0,75 percentage points in three meetings “despite limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA” said Lacker.
Later the Fed representatives these shortening cancelled one year.
The Fed should to be set aspects of financial stability only during a heavy crisis as for the market collapse 2008 to the first place, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the committee for the interest definition of the bank OF England.
The recent turbulences come not into the proximity of this level, said it.
“Does not want to come you surely into the situation, in which it has fear of an increase in interest, because the markets excite themselves, said” Posen, Präsident of Peterson Institute for internationally Economics.
Federal Reserve act contains still the double mandate and does not mention not financial stability, and to which it is changed believes I not that it should precede the time.
