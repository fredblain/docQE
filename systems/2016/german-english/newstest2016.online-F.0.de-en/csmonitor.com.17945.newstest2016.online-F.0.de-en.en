That will happen, if the Fed increases the interest
An increase in interest comes, and the boom will come into staggering, net yields for loans will become will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know.
Which we do not know are, how last long that everything and how long will stop it.
In particular history offers only small instruction for the economy for execution.
A recession came within only 11 months to the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The aggressiveness of Federal Reserve with the raising of the interest rates often is, if also not always, a factor thereby how the economy and the financial assets react.
Therefore representatives of the US-central bank stressed so violently that investors should not concentrate on when them begin to increase the interest rates but rather on the period, which is needed for the normalization.
Indeed several variables play a role.
In the end market players could state however that the whole excitement was possibly exaggerated because of an increase in interest.
“The first increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted inevitably of some as a signal for the end the era “of the cheap money””, said Julian Jessop, Chefökonom with Capital Economics, in a report at customers.
In contrast to it we expect not the gradual return of the US-interest to normal heights, but still on too low level, in order to the seismic shock, which many seem to be afraid to lead.
That means however not that it will not give effects.
Here is a view of, based on historical trends how some ranges of the economy could react:
How the market saw in the last month, the anticipation of increases in interest can make things for one while volatile.
As soon as the increase arrives, the influence is not so dramatic.
“There is apparently a tendency that receipts from capital 12 to 24 months after the first increase are strangled, which reflects, said perhaps again the delay in the monetary policy” German bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after increases in interest of the Fed.
More exactly said, the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2,6 percent), then back to the normal condition after 500 days, with an average net yield in the past six cycles of 14,4 percent, passed, according to a current analysis, which Bob Doll, boss investment strategist with Nuveen ate management, with Barron's published.
It said Deutsche Bank that the effects arise tendentious later on the shares in the increase cycle and the net yield begins to be reduced.
Recessions are a fact of the economic life, but increases in interest often promote them.
In the current case the Fed is confronted with some conditions, which there were not before and which could to accelerate a recession.
Extremely remarkably it is here that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point during an increase in interest of the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank only twice the nominal Gross Domestic Product was below 4,5 percent with the 118 increases in interest since 1950.
Although the second quarter was 2015 with 3,6 percent, only few expect that this will persist and to expect for the third quarter according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.
Increases in interest with a so fragile economical backdrop could be risky and throw the question up, “whether it this time different are”, said Deutsche Bank.
Market players made themselves calm all year on an increase in interest of the Fed, and all eyes were this week directed toward the meeting of the federal open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economist believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this meeting, the Futures trade indicates only a probability of 25 percent.
“In our study all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a supercycle with increasing momentum at the Gross Domestic Product and prerecession heights very fast after the beginning of the recovery outshone”, so the report.
In contrast to it this is a clearly slow recovery of what the worst recession was in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, which the Fed waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The firm income was also volatile, since the market anticipates an increase in interest, and the sample is rather similar as on the capital market.
The main difference is the fact that the effect is faster with loans than with shares if changes its strategic course.
With loans the net yields seem to change the direction, as soon as the first increase/lowering takes place in the cycle.
In the end the increase cycle the loan net yields fall immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise will lead with the interest rates to the fact that net yields between longer and shorter loans move closer together closer and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest-bearing loans bring often in such a climate better yields, although “we are still careful, higher yields to expect”, said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analyst with Schwab, in an analysis.
, Means Jones is interesting that the markets already adapted to Fed strategy expectations.
“Apart from the strength of the dollar and the decrease of inflation expectations there are some signs for the fact that the market to the prospect on stricter monetary policy adapted” wrote her.
Short term interest rose, the yield curve is flatter, credit breakdowns expanded and volatility rose - all characteristics of the market, if the Fed intensifies its strategy.
On the whole enterprises, which complete the larger part of their business activity in the USA, will profit from it, if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational enterprises with high debts will more badly stand there, there a rising dollar their products on the global market make more expensive and likewise the financing of their debts.
“History shows that “quality “shares bends to extremely positively react three months after a initial increase in interest” said Goldman Sachs-Analysten in a report for the customers.
Companies with strong balance exceeded enterprises with weak balance on the average after each of the increases in interest 1994, 1999 and 2004 around 5 percentage points.
Enterprises with high capital net yields as well as low volatility with its shares exceeded also her counterparts with bottom quality around on the average in each case 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts become a large problem.
Enterprises with a high portion of flexible interest will lose at most, said Goldman.
Outside of the pure share plays consumer will likewise profit by the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits by higher yields, even if experts of different opinion are, how quickly that will take place.
