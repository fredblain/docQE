Seven's Sunrise dominates the evaluations to take over despite the attempts of Nine, the loss of the leadership with the Today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush after Canberra, in order to report following the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it furnished no large shifts with the evaluations for Today.
The breakfast show of Nine was radiated by the Federal Capital, when Malcolm Turnbull created the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with which moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage put, into London as part of an one-week series of international television broadcasts, to which also Dubai, New York, Niagara of case and Cancun belonged.
This disadvantage of the distance did not seem to play a role for Australian TV-spectators, since Sunrise on the average 397,000 spectators obtained with the five capitals, in the comparison to it Today 339.000.
Today obtained an easy in relation to increase the rating for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but its number stayed behind from last Thursday (343.000).
Today closed the gap in the last months to Sunrise.
In August Today reached 318,000 on the average compared with the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year the distance between 40.000 and 50.000 ran.
So far in September Sunrise stands with on the average 349,000 spectators to 314,000 with Today.
This is the most interesting, which passes each morning.
These morning people concern the hoist of the change more than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are correct, thank for the examination!

The large news for Seven was the impressing debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed ton the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama over a recently widowed father, who decides itself to establish itself with its two children at the coast of New Zealand achieved a very much impressing number of 1.219 million spectator.
Critics had asked themselves whether Thomson could carry a hit show solo one without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result from last night answered this with clear “yes”.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.136 million spectators and struck easily The block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven had mixed results in evening two from The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17,30 o'clock) of the new quiz show, moderated of Andrew O'Keefe showed on the average 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 clock until 18:00) jumped on 623.000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires's Hot Seat (613.000).
On Monday evening the first half hour obtained 520,000 spectators of The Chase Australia and in the second half hour full 720.000.
Hot Seat on the average 620.000.
The decrease with the ratios of the second evening of The Chase Australia will tune Nine confidently that Hot Seat will finally become generally accepted around 17:30 clock.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for million dollar minute it did not create to outstrip the McGuires show.
