The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Pfälzer ancestor of Donald Trump came from a place, whose inhabitant showoff is called.
This characteristic connects to some also with the billionaire, the US president will wants.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for exciters.
Whether he expresses himself xenophobic, journalists coarse concerns or reveals knowledge gaps in the international crisis politics - the applicant for the office for US president whirls up the election campaign strongly.
And fares well thereby.
That is registered also in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker one with the foehn hair-style is many in the winegrower village at the wine route a term.
Some in the 1200-Einwohner-Ort is over - tens of corners to him is related.
Its grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinat: Donald Trump, here in the election campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel turned a film over Trump.
And which the villagers think of his goal, most powerful man of the world to become?
“I believe, those find that somehow exciting, am not however in their Kallstadter kind also so deeply impressive”, say Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin turned an amusing documentary film over the place and its famous offspring, among which beside Trump also the ketchup family Heinz ranks.
Trump, which does not admit for modesty is, comes into “Kings OF Kallstadt” (2014) also to word - so with the statement that he would be probably also successful, if he would live in Kallstadt.
To the king of the hearts it did not bring it there.
Give it to respect for the achievement of the family, in addition, tendentious the opinion that Trump is “already a little a bigmouth”, says spiral.
Coincidentally read the nickname, which Kallstadt in the area has, “the Brulljesmacher” - to standard German: , it says the showoffs.
Trump comes thus from the village of the showoffs.
The Trump' success story began 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold graves.
Foundation-stone of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York.
But the life of grandparents was not free from tragedy: Their desire to return in the long term to the homeland failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinat belonged at that time.
It does not have Trump taken up, because he is knocked off without approval once, the director of the institute for Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, to film release had explained.
Trump is the grandchild of a “illegal emigrant”.
That stands in contrast to the every now and then marrowy statements of the descendant.
That had repetitive adversely spoken about Mexican immigrants in the USA and the building of a border wall had demanded, in order to deter illegal immigrants.
“As, is not so pleasant that rumbles”, says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant related Trumps (“the granny was a born Trump, the Grandpa was born Heinz”).
The winegrower in the retirement sees the American rather reserved, “he is always like that flaring up”.
Does he believe that Trump comes times?
“I can not present that”, say myself to the 72-year old.
“It never worried about Kallstadt”.
The pension landlady Veronika Schramm mentions like some Kallstadter that a descendant of the family Heinz donated something with a visit for the church organ, which arrived generally well.
“I can not present that from the Donald”, say myself the 68-year old.
She would find it better, if he did not win the choice, because “that has such radical opinions, I white not whether that is good”.
If those, which had at present its grandfather in the USA a saying, had been like that like he, “it would have there never arrived”.
“It gives more interesting topics than it”, says winegrower daughter to Sarah Bühler.
And as a president?
“My president is it not”, says her.
And: “The clusters become ripe also without president Trump”.
Wendels film, for which Trump was for a long time interviewed, to have 12,000 moviegoers seen, also in the USA awakes the interest.
