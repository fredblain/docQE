Experts criticize report of Public Health England over E-cigarettes
Statements of a state-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than a smoking developed from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts, who write in British Medical Journal (BMJ), followed Lancet, by criticizing the proofs used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report over e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “fundamental report” in the past month and describes it as a “comprehensive examination of the proofs”.
But some researchers placed and referred the maximum stress of the data in question to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial in the medical technical periodical Lancet last month attacked the “extraordinarily windy basis”, on which PHE justified its most important conclusion.
Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the statements develop “on stone or sand”.
Martin McKee, professor for European Öffentlichde health to London School OF hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, professor for clinical epidemiology at the University OF Liverpool, said: “A basic principle of the public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of the effectiveness.”
They said the fact that the public expects that the statement of PHE that “the present best estimation is that E-cigarettes are less harmful about 95% than a smoking” on a detailed examination of the proofs and is based to the modelling.
Indeed this statement comes from only one meeting of 12 people, who became to call up to lead in order to develop a model for a multiple criterion decision analysis (multi-criteria Decision analysis - MCDA), in order their opinions across the damage from different nicotine haltigen products to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said the fact that a sponsor of the meeting was a company named EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director was before to have received means (ASKED) for an independent study from British American Tobacco.
He signed also the references of ASKED to the public health in a sustainability report, said her.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to receive means from a E-cigarette-manufacturer to but they did not add the financing, which it was to have received after reports before from the tobacco enterprise Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied, but in addition several well-known E-cigarette-champions belong, from whom some also in the paper indicate a branch financing.
Some other participants in this meeting are not admit for their know-how in tobacco control.
In the meeting participated also the tobacco line of PHE.
The research work of the group “confesses characteristically” that there is a lack of “hard proofs for the damage of most products with most criteria”, wrote McKee and Capewell.
However none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Capewell said that the statements of PHE that “there are so far no proofs that E-cigarettes serve as a way to smoking for children or nonsmokers” prematurely were.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director for health and well-being with PHE, said that to the statements of BMJ one reacted already before.
He said: “E-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than a smoking.”
Each second lifelong smoker dies at his craze.
All proofs put near that the health risks of E-cigarettes are small in the comparison to it, but that we have to study further the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation for the information of the public about what the proof occupies and which not, above all, if there is public confusion so much over the relative dangers in the comparison to the tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 humans die annually at an illness with reference to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ per year.
By the clear presentation of current proofs that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage, which is caused by smoking, fulfill we represent our national responsibility.
