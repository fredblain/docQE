Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in the gate
With Borussia Dortmund all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus smashed themselves in the first group play Europe League finally.
The national player will be missing to the table leader of the soccer federal league also in the duel with the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19,00 o'clock/Sky).
“We can not fall back to him unfortunately”, said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be on Sunday in the Bundesliga Topspiel against Leverkusen again thereby, the BVB coach left open: “We count on a return of him to training on Friday”.
In view of the high load of its professionals Tuchel will not only change its master eleven on the Reus position.
Thus he announced a change on the goal keeper position.
Therefore Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of master keeper Roman Bürki.
“It trained on an absolute Top level”, praised the football teacher the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller is used in the future in all Europe League plays, left Tuchel open however.
With high probability it will deny also the second portion.
The vigorous statement of fellow player Reus that the final introduction for the BVB must be in Europes League the goal, considers midfield player Julian Weigl comprehensible: “With it Marco does not lie so wrongly.”
“I think for measuring that we have a good opportunity, the title.”
