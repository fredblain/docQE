Surely does David Cameron The Lorax know better?
It is a thing, which all parents learn soon: If your child loves a book, it will not for a long time last, until you know it nearly by heart.
It is, you is perhaps David Cameron.
When it was asked of a provider of child care systems to call its favourite children's book the Prime Minister decided for The Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: “hilariously, moving, creatively and with a strong message to always give it is a book, which I read out gladly to my children, because it seems a picture or a message which we missed so far.”
Everything beautifully and well, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron describes allegedly the action of the book, instead a summary of the film version of 2012 shows, which new characters and details added, to extend in order the rather short original text.
“In the midst of the ummauerten city Thneed Ville, where all nature went and even air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams by its desire to see a genuine tree fulfilled”, reading one. An interest of love was to Dr. Seuss, whose correct name Theodor Seuss hostage read and to who 1991 died, however completely unknown.
As if that would be suspicious not yet enough: The text submitted by Cameron reads itself partly like the summary that of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website by Internet Movie DATA base and begins in such a way: “In the ummauerten city Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey to win the girl of its dreams.”
Although it admits yes, a pragmatic father to be, it seems improbable that Cameron the action of the book is so little familiar. Here a unnamed boy, how the local environment by the money-hungry, trees fällenden, hears Thneed knitting Once more ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, schnurrbärtigen nature, “in the name of the trees speaks”, is devastated.
In all probability such was delegated a relatively low PR-task to an aide, that did not read out The Lorax 20 times one behind the other a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text had probably come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's employees, gave however no further direct comments.
