Smokers have to lose a higher risk of teeth
Smokers therefore not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - which sets a long-term study Potsdamer close.
The good news: In waiving the risk decreases rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to nonsmokers was in smokers the risk prematurely losing their teeth, 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher.
Scientists had more than 23,300 participants observed.
Main causes of tooth loss are decay and inflammation of the gums that emphasizes DIfE.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors stress.
The link between smoking and tooth loss therefore go back on frequent gingivitis in smokers.
was not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
People who stopped smoking, their risk, but may decrease in a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
It could, however, take more than ten years, until the hazard falling back to the level of nonsmokers, said lead author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham.
We must convince people to be Non smoking, said study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE: "Smoking reduces life time."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge also to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, about 20 percent of the population are affected aged 65 to 74 years of edentulism, shared the DIfE with.
Previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study matiere the findings.
