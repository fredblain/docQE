In the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month there was the lowest result since records began in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that the Black Friday has curbed spending in November
For over a decade, the virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say that there are now signs that the online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months, 2015.
The total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000 with only five per cent increase over the previous year.

"If you go back look at the growth rates for the previous years and to 2000, then has it always develops over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG-sales index the Guardian.
He explained that the online sales be increased three years ago, began as a buyer, using their cell phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, eg. As at home on the sofa.
But now levels off that, and we may see that reduced growth.
The Black Friday phenomenon that was imported from America, is cited as a reason for declining revenues.
Experts believe that buyers their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November, hold back.
Last year, five times rallied the average number of buyers to their computers to do their deals, and some merchant sites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, at which the buyers fought for bargains, buyers could stop them from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that £ 5 spending just over £ 1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines more than a third of purchases are now performed through web stores.
At the same time buys more than a quarter of men clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
