In an emergency admits Professor of having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice to the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officials would come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize the fact that his "sweet dog" but still alive and had probably excited and he said the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the home, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note which was scrawled on a white block: "I do it so sorry, I wish I could undo, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me. " This was reported by the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who, taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds, where he claimed to police a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, on the door has shot to his office and killed.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18 AM.
He said that Lamb has eventually made the fateful emergency thereafter.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamb took his own life when police him einkesselte.
A day after the shooting in the university, the students and teachers forced them to hide behind closed doors, the authorities are still trying to gain a picture of what motivated Lamb.
Published by the investigators at both ends of the state details, as well as what students and staff who knew him testified, helped to paint a picture of a talented, but perhaps difficult teacher.
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had Lamb mentioned in a written by him book in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty includes 17 members, and many students attended courses by both.
At the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes said that Lamb had told him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014-15 to deal with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to a leave of absence for health reasons and said here that he had any health problem.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the employment policies of the university meant that the promotion had worked so hard for the Lamb, would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor of him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's idea."
These are questions that the Lamb can not answer.
After fleeing from the campus police found later Lambs track when he import again in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, killed himself Lamb selbstmit a .38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started in 2009 his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in spring in pedagogy.
One of the longtime girlfriends Lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried for several years to teach her to play the guitar.
He was the heartthrob.
All the girls melted away when he was there, "Hairston said, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency Lamb said, "I have my wife killed", but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said that the dog was fine.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and Blues played.
Lamb struck Prentiss, when he and Abigail both occurred on a summer carnival three years ago.
Later they played together the odd gig.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night at night on September 5 last after Lamb his guitar and harmonica ended had ended in front of a sparse audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were busy clearing and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, headed the freshman seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, Don Allan Mitchell said, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his fraternity and the student committee.
On the Delta State campus in Cleveland on Tuesday night took about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members at a candlelight memorial service part.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vigil, while the University Choir "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying our students to encourage them to return," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he Schmidt shot, and that lamb indeed called his wife in his emergency Prentiss, but there is no indication that the two ever got married.
