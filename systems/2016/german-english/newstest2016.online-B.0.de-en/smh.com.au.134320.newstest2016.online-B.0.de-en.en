Man of damp Police chase persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman was dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man of Perth, off the police was unsuccessful, as he was in shallow and swampy water, only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "gently to persuade him to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale was summoned on Tuesday to a trespassing incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect tried this, to escape them towards Canning River.
But he came not too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I will not come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too excited to make his uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "negotiated a good cop."
"Sometimes people do funny things to escape to try," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid an alcohol-control, and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning a Ben Cousins Biathlon.
