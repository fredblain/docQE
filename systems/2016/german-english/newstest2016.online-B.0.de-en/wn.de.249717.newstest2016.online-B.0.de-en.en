Robot cars: government wants leading role for Germany
Germany is the intention of the federal government to be the transformation of the car a technological pioneer.
The Federal Cabinet approved a strategy paper from the home of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides, inter alia, investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure on Wednesday.
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the car show IAA by a "new mobility era".
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He will also discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, coming together at the IAA also with representatives of the industry.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid shift to digital radio among others.
For testing of new technology is currently being built a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria.
Thus the driver "are saddled with no additional liability risks", wants the federal government "review and, where necessary, adapted to the new developments," the legal framework.
Thus, Germany will about international efforts to ensure that the maximum speed limit for self-propelled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The federal government also wants to work for a change of the Vienna Convention, which provides far only humans as drivers.
When automated driving takes increasingly the car, the guide, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture and process the data in seconds the environment.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy highly automated driving on highways by 2020 be technically possible.
Nevertheless are driverless vehicles "to be expected until well after 2020" on public roads.
The value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study in 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The cars of digital networking can lead to increased safety and efficiency on the road," said the SPD politician traffic SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The issue of liability in case of accidents and the security of personal data, the driver must be clarified, however.
Yet look at the German self-propelled cars, however, skeptical - much more than the French or Americans.
A study presented on Wednesday at the AA survey by the Forsa Institute commissioned by the testing organization Dekra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expected before 20 years thus, 31 percent believe not in it.
In France expect 21 percent of respondents to 2025 with an autonomous driving cars, in the US 33 percent.
Anyway, the car drivers are not ready to completely rely on a self-propelled vehicle in Germany.
According to a survey of digital association Bitkom only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout their travel on all roads.
On the highway itself could imagine at least 15 percent in flowing traffic, in traffic 45 percent.
Good one in four would leave the car in control under any circumstances.
