Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it is still hard
On Pakistan to push in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad, England has selected for the tour you can see a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin player in the batting line-up, and the community spirit is strong; they are no scars of 2012 Calendar, only a teen-positive attitude.
With the ball to Moeen Ali developed as a spin-bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for the attack.
Thereafter related message: Adam Lyth is leaving the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
Of course, the decision to leave out Adam Lyth is, for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, difficult to analyze.
In his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and is the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are geared to results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, because - and I have said before this - players are their own best selector.
Long ago, one would have extended the run of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he knocks out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if it did not yield as good performance, and that does not surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time gets a Test batsman to put his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton nine got.
Only Compton got the chance to home and away games.
The only reproach which one can raise, was that England first Jonathan Trott began in the Caribbean - as Lyth was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman, the I value highly.
He's an X-factor Cricketer what we saw in Yorkshire early this season when he scored on a Trent Bridge Place 236 against us, which was very hit us.
He must have at least the same opportunities as the get in front of him, but this of course depends on the team's formation, in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to propose Moeen beside Cook what an extra-spin bowler and provide four Quicks would receive, appeared, and I do not mind.
I do not see why a batsman there can not be beat, and the left-handed has already shown that he's a hotshot Cricket Player.
Moeen might have his job for his County Worcestershire not done, but it is a number 3 on it, and since there is no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drop before it occurred 2001 as opener.
He managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People look at possibly its statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - think and it is a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and have the coach opted for youth ,
He will learn on this tour a lot.
Apart from the team England has made some clever additions at the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as advisor for the test matches could be a champion coup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup.
I always felt already that it is designed for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and as Mahela he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room, even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing.
Collys teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the one-dayers, Root received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem on my part with it.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team stand not to specify the schedule.
And you must remember that their jobs depend on the outcome as the players.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
