BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of parliament criticized the station for its "dumbing down"
He argues that it is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice, saying that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "up converts" to Classic FM, says a leading member of parliament and raised new pressure on the sender to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters do.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also said the BBC bosses that the public radio station "verdumme" and is increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word '' not like - but it seems to transform into Classic FM" dumb down, he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, which started last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year seem to have The Brits just under a different name.
So if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you actually only imitate what is already on the market, "Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director General dismissed the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial rivals lie when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, which I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly second to none.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and give new works, I really think this is important," he said.
Earlier this year, argued BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey that harder must be worked to engage the audience, as it did so in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only member of the BBC production which it fell during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport under fire, the commercial rival to step on their feet.
The Tory MPs Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show by the BBC, which was bought by the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of Â£ 22 million.
See a why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced "in a special BBC-way".
He added that he wished that the company "a hit from our own barn find" when it next time Create an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out the appointment of another series of The Voice in the future or spend money the fee payer for other entertainment formats.
