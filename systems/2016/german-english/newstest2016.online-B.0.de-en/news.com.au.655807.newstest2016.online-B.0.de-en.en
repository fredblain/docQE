reveals secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly apparently who wins The Bachelor.
The woman at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally lands was shrouded in absolute secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether it is the one that the last rose has received.
But when we on the day before are two of three, checked with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, you may have given an indication by mistake, who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed tight until the final on Thursday
All three women have omitted lyrical manner about why Wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should get Woods last rose?", Might their responses to be a spoilsport, who won the heart of the Bachelors.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both named soon - except itself - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had with each other from day one a simple relationship.
"From the moment when I went into the house and (Sarah) and Sams energies noticed because I felt that they were quite compatible, I would have thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From their perspective, told Mackay that the home visit last week you made it clear that Wood "the One" could be.
"Once I saw it with my friends and family, I realized that this is clearly not just a game - I am now set unconditionally to him," she said.
And when asked who should choose Wood, when, as it was not puzzling.
"I do not know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it is a tie between Snezana and Lana.
