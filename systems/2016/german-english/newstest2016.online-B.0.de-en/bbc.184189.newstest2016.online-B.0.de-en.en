formed homeless youths to photographers: 'Shot in Joburg'
The center of Johannesburg is a tough place when you're homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and to earn a livelihood.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was ge in Joburg (achieved) shot) is a nonprofit club that teaches homeless youth in how they take pictures of their surroundings and make a profit from it.
BBC News has taken one of the first graduates of the project.
