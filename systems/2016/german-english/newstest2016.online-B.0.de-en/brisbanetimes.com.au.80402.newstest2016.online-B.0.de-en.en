Metcash starts Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi incident
Metcash trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepared to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen Metcash and IGA supermarkets its relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media, as well as through events Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jumping on board, with brands such as ice maker Simmo from Dunsborough, which distributes in IGA stores samples and shopkeepers who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that Metcash more details of its defense strategy on 29 September published if the wholesaler of food, alcohol and equipment performs its annual Investor Strategy Day.
Much is at stake, as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia, compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern countries.
However, analysts believe how Morgan Stanley that Aldi will snatch twelve months following the opening of its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two countries and all known actors, but mainly independent retailers sales will take away.
A report published this week report, estimated the Analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers could lose $ 360 million in sales per year and Metcash $ 250 million by the end of 2016th
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and in the quantities on Metcashs high fixed cost base could Metcash cost around $ 13 million profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time loses Metcash market share in the Eastern countries, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcashs sales in the food and grocery will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent will reduce to 2020th
Last week told the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash probably within a decade. will Metcash disappear.
Metcash declined to respond publicly on the comments of Mr Douglass.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash with Mr Douglass last week contacted.
IGAs market share has dropped since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailer, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins ,
However, the wholesalers defends itself by investing more than $ 150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products every week and improve IGA retailers in improving their shops by faster-growing fresh food and a better selection of private label to provide -Lebensmitteln.
Metcashs chief executive Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store refurbishment programs are set to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return in 2017 for the first time in four years at a profit growth.
