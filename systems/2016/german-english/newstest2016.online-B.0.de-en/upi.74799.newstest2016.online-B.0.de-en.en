Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tigers.
Earlier they used to be one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played this role perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted an opportunity for advancement within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild card place.
For Detroit, even if only for an evening, there was a return of the three-letter F-word, which was so hard to put on a lot of the second half of the season away.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support than Detroit three times scored in the first two innings, then again in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck 6 times on the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish strong this year," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and therefore I will totally focused to go into the game.
The designated hitter Victor Martinez Tiger had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez, since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has the bat well swinging," said Ausmus.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it into play.
With three runs in behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double to the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks reached a colorful, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to strikeout, before he was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy went over the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the nominee for Rookie batsman Miguel Sano, of the right-Drew Verhagen snatched a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second brought Verhagen third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading in Major League 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit at the end of the ninth inning added an insurance run, managed wall an RBI-double against the Tigers Closer Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
However, the right-handed stabbed Sano out in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by a not moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed before the game from the injury list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back injury.
"Obviously not the start that I have liked," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable than I reciting and felt that I could do some pretty good pitches as in the third inning."
After they got the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes fired a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play which managed a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez managed his success 0-21 series with runners in scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right side, managed another run, but Victor Martinez was kicked out of the game, as he was trying to get to the third, what the threat ended.
The Tigers were up in the second, scored a one-out double by catcher James McCann and a two-out single by center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big shock," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He did not particularly well beaten, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.
When Hughes led to three runs and six hits a walk with four strikeouts.
