The Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union-bearing (Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union = withdrawal of Britain from the EU) could gain in feed when the economy is up to 2017 in the doldrums
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will fall every day deeper in trouble even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "Is it yes or no?" Corbyn the leader of Labour or the TUC, the violently quarreled for Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises, such as the EU, it is now time and not always their own fault, Britain created Agenda with split concessions and disruptive treaty changes, they usually do not want to be sick ,
In Brighton the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they also do not like when they threaten social protection.
We could also call it Dave and Georges Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Finance climbing summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local variables, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It is always about me.
My European friend who wants a-sighted outside Britain inside the EU tent - "Let us not only with France," says Berlin - and lets slip that more and come more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals to the point are, where they do not care whether we stay or go.
Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she's 10 years in power and wants to leave the office before it bad for her looks as in the exaggerated long persevering as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and carbon (16) is done.
France François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017th
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon a nationalist right-wing government, a left Spain.
It is hard to imagine that they will bend over backwards to help the Selfie-British, whose power would be better used for preventing Scotland exit from the UK - something they do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, you may plan some such ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments, quite the SNP-style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Proposed referendum on United Kingdom membership of the European Union process, suspected my friend.
"The renegotiation was a disaster" and "Britain has not won anything of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be on their costs and what Eurosceptics is the oligarchy of the press barons, as they did not had it during inspired by Tony Benn referendum in 1975 that our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2: 1 supported.
You can faintly remember Boris Johnson, the ore-Euro-opportunist who has made a name for himself as an "EU-straight bananas' Brussels correspondent in the early 90s.
For all his madness knew Ed Miliband, who were his enemies.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains Phone chopping foreigners and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but noted that, if you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better bananas distributed to distract him, instead of being to his lunch, and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer as Blair himself when he Camerons referendum vertebrae opposed because Blair had put the principle about not adopted the EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving it thus a backdoor opened.
The press has also never forgave him.
But the cute Jeremy Corbyn, the Westminster a friendly pat on the back gave me on Monday - I told him that he need not waste any more time for me - seems in danger, Neil Kinnock boycott Murdoch strategy 80s to repeat a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but it must develop a coherent strategy to attract the media, not to me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position on Europe is - I press it times out nicely - in development.
He says that we should remain in a reformed EU.
Now, most people outside Ukips traditional blue dye trend and the wilder realms of Torys small Engländerismus can say yes to each well.
It's what Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn said this week on radio and television, as the Scouts fought in it, not admitting that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70's, when his old father on television therefore tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his Cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow MPs and by all accounts at their meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever wants to convey the sentimental bottom-up Image Corbyn - remember that he has stirred even me - Message discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and, above all, in the vortex of social media a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe, which allowed him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign for granted, like McDonnell said it.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities towards EU membership - in accordance with its Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents, for the narcissism of small difference, a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC does not start a campaign for the exit - will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superiors at home foreign diplomats.
Why should Paris or Berlin political capital waste, - they have a mistrustful voters - to make concessions to the British, if anything can be meaningless?
The US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in cost of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something British Influence Security Forum called ,
