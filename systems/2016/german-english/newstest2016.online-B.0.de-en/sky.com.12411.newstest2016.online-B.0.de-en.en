Why am I witnessing an execution in Oklahoma
Later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already the first time in January on his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to be afraid.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way, the whole story about the death penalty to tell.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and often there are more applications than places available, there will be a macabre lottery to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has the number of media seats reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen, it is observed emotion.
I can not do this.
I'll sit next to Richard Glossips tightest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a half hours visiting.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist, so I shall be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter to abandon my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and for access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have been better formulated" but she still thinks that it is wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things that I have said and written.
He does not tell me what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter is present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
Please, if you want to know more about the case, you will hear the series of podcasts that I have made.
I will not go into all the details again.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary indeed.
But I believe that a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to warrant a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will watch him die.
I can not claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn it.
What you will get from me, is what it is, an unnecessary death dying to see a man.
