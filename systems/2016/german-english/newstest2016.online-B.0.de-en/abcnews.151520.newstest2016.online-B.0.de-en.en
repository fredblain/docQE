Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was professionally a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was remarkable also for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary "Back in Time ".
The film begins, and it comes into my mind that I'm a simulated yawning and an arm's length away from being the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, and with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere 30 years ago.
"It is for me really," Spielberg said, "indisputably the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be seen on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
