The park is located in ancient Rome next to the Coliseum.
The name had been requested by the Association of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, Pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday because the Protestants were for centuries as a minority often live their faith in secret in the City of the Popes.
The space will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome was welcome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) kept a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year 1510/11 a few months in Rome.
He found the city at that time as depraved iniquity.
His negative impressions expected him to historians have confirmed in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against indulgences.
