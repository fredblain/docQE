Friends Festival: the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male friendships
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up, is now made more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013 it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the issue, announced the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) of 2015 as the year of the man who, with the aim of placing culture at issue that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that when the sufferer a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy atmosphere" had his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, halved, a group of sane friends the risks of mental health problems.
Of course, one must first have friends so a friendship can work.
In the era of guided through social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, doubled, although in reality dominates the insulation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all intrinsic cost values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects much deeper on our mental health.
And like a video game creator billionaire recently declared, money can buy happiness not really.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality that shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments when watching football in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross by Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often hold back fully their feelings to explore.
As an employee of the telephone counseling it told me: ... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and suicidal are, I really shown clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying, "I come so rightly" has a tremendous impact, like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking openly about problems. "
Friends is one of the shows that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It presents very clearly the little moments of male friendships.
Like My objective outsider status over the phone to help people so much in moments of desperation and that long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit this weekend Comedy Central Friends festival with the honor of the day completely redesigned backdrop, why do not you take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk with.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sit in Starbucks alone, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
