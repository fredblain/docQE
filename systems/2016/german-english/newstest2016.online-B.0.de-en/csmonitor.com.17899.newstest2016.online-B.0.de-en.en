Five members of the Brotherhood with the death of Baruch College Freshman loaded
Nearly two years after a student during a vexatious ritual a fraternity in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania died, filed murder charges against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual introduction in September 2013 brutally and delayed his journey to hospital, which has contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been debited blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and have been repeatedly attacked as he tried to reach out to a target on a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call the emergency number 911, after Deng passed out and waited allegedly an hour before they took him to a hospital, according to police.
However, they have had time to change clothes Deng googling his symptoms and Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood to contact for advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the good of the fraternity principle about Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
After an autopsy report Deng were repeatedly inflicted blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student died since 1970 every year to the harassment," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step of authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a murder charge third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng are also accused vexatious attacks and criminal association.
"We do not only make the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization - formally or informally - has sanctioned this, so we will hold accountable those," Wagner told a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their membership in the local group.
