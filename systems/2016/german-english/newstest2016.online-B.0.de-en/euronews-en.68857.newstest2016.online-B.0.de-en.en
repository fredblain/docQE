Time deciding on interest rates on the US Federal Reserve
The world observed when the US Federal Reserve in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision, whether for almost a decade, interest rates are raised for the first time or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters, found that slightly more than half of which was last week of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks the Fed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level of 0 - will hold 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event because it was seven years ago, since the Fed interest rates to zero set.
"For the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-range and a process of normalization of interest rates will start", Angel Ubide, senior staff said at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good level of performance, trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed can not ignore the less rosy view of global relationships.
She has the markets warned to prepare for an increase, but the indications are that the odds against such a step are good.
The decision is to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
