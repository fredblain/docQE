Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of very great fashion show and a waxwork Gruselkabinett: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has presented an exhibition of his work in Munich on Wednesday.
Highlights: mannequins that look frighteningly human thanks video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of French designer, which has been used with Madonna's stage outfits to big star of the fashion scene - and the fact that he put men in skirts.
"I can no longer say that I am, the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair."
"Earlier it was bleached, now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen on 18 September at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the couturier its initially dismissive attitude has changed to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me an exhibition sounded a bit like death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously done this in Montreal and in Paris station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen said.
This is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the barely over-looking work of the man, the fashion history wrote, without ever having received training.
Chronologically, the exhibition is not built up, but it is a perfectly choreographed Gesamtkunstwerk, for much effort has been made: to comb the dolls, specially a stylist for example, was committed.
14 tons of material have carted according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich the makers.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest a special treat was still in the process: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He had always been interested in strong women ( "women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Also Gaultier old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.
It represents the first, tentative fashionable baby steps of the designer.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad in football) he had his teddy dressed bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
Playing with a puppet, his parents would not allow him.
Designing fashion he had later taught himself.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the other designers such as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later I then but of course bought.
For his first fashion show he had the models can not pay.
They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.
