Rosberg single currency: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows in the battle for the world title in Formula 1 to its clear leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton only one motto: "Full attack".
The WM-Second emphasized before the start of the crucial seven flyaways, "I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the runner-up in front of the night race in Singapore this Sunday by defending champion and double champion Hamilton.
The Briton has won seven of the previous twelve races and taking the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state is also the favorite in attack.
2009, last year was the 30 year old Briton to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state at the Singapore Grand Prix will have an impact, is still unclear.
For days a pall of smog hangs over the city, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
