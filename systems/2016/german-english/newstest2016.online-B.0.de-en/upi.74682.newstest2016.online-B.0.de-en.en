'American Ninja Warrior' crowned first Champion
Professional sports climbers and busboy Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete of the American Ninja Warrior won on Monday night and the Grand Prize of $ 1 million took home.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never seen a competition participant, who was able to complete all the steps of his obstacle course.
During the season finale made it two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, to the finals.
For the last task climbing belonged to a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time which he was the first athlete who completed the grueling phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However Caldiero ended this challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke with E! News after the hard-fought victory, still under the shock of winning the grand prize of $ 1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $ 10,000 or had to live," Isaac said E! over his pile of money.
So all of a sudden .. I can not even imagine what it's like ... the future is unknown to me.
The executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter, to discuss the finale and why Britten, although he was the first ever finished the course, does not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it is replaced by one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changing, he receives the great bonus.
I do not think that he also harbors some resentment.
He is to have just done so happy that he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if they had reversed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the shooting will begin in the spring 2016th
