This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know this.
What we do not know how long all this and how long it will last.
In particular, has the history of the economy little guidance on the conduct.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US Federal Reserve have so vigorously emphasized that investors should not focus on when they begin to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
However, at the end of market participants might find that all the excitement may have been exaggerated for a rate increase.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably by some as a signal for the end of the era of" "be interpreted" cheap money, said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still at too low level to cause seismic shock, many seem to fear.
This does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a based on historical trends look at how some sectors of the economy might react:
As the market has seen in the past month, the anticipation of rate hikes can make things for a while volatile.
Once the increase is received, the effect is not as dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that investment income from 12 to 24 months after the first increase be stalled, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said German Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after rate hikes by the Fed ,
More specifically, the market is in the last 35 years mostly on the rise - about 14 percent - on the way to raise interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis, published Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset management in Barron's.
The German bank said that the impact on the stocks tend to occur later in the cycle and increase the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes they promote often.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
Most notable here is that the gross domestic product close to its lowest point will be at a rate hike by the Fed.
According to German Bank nominal GDP stood at the 118 rate hikes since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, expect just that this will continue and expected for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed only 1.5 percent.
Increases in interest rates at such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question, "whether this time is different," the German bank said.
Market participants have made throughout the year in for a rate hike by the Fed, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week that ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session, the futures trading shows only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles have occurred from 1950 to the present in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs made very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shadows", the report said.
In contrast, this is a unique slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect of bond is faster than stocks when the change its strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to change direction when the first increase / reduction is performed in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle increasing bond yields fall immediately, the German bank said.
The strategist with Charles Schwab believe that the rise will result in interest rates means that yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High yield bonds often bring in such a climate better yields, although "we are careful not to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones said that the markets have already adapted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened their strategy.
By and large, are companies which conduct a large proportion of their business in the United States, benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with large debts are worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market as well as to finance their debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend to respond very positively three months after an initial rate hike," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded company with weak balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and lower volatility in their shares outperformed their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 each (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debts are a major problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity Games consumers will also benefit by the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts disagree on how quickly this will take place.
