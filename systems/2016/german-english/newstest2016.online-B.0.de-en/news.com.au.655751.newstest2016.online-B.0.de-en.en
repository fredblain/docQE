Seven's Sunrise dominated the ratings, despite the attempts of Nine to accept the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liberals in the port, but it has provided no major shifts in the ratings for Today.
The breakfast show from Nine aired from the federal capital, as Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television programs, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun belonged.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to 339,000 Today.
Today achieved a slight increase on the ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his numbers fell short of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has in recent months closed the gap to Sunrise.
In August Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year went the distance 40000-50000.
So far in September Sunrise is at an average of 349,000 viewers to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting, what happens every morning.
The winds of change regarding this morning people over the Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!
