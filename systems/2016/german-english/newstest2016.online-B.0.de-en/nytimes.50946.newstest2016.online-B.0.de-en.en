killed 4 people after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police shot rubber bullets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rupandehi, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District Officer, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, where some of them stones and threw firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police have used tear gas and fired into the air, before they resorted to rubber bullets.
20 policemen and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, one of which is known to kill while, but which are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The dispute was the latest violent in weeks protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of ethnic Madhesi say that new provinces, which are formed under the proposed new constitution, would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, in violent clashes since the 10th
killed August when the four major political parties signed agreements to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been ruled for centuries centrally.
The work on a new constitution since 2008 on the way, but the legislature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake which had killed thousands of people in April.
The legislature voted this week about certain provisions in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
