Exceptions for new Bernrieder Gymnasium
The council Bernried approved the planning application for the 2.3 million-euro Gymnasium.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flat for solar system.
Planning for the long-awaited turn Hall on Bernrieder Sportgel√§nde progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting of elaborate planning application was approved unanimously without much discussion.
Previously, the Panel had decided to apply for a baugesetzliche "exceptional" respectively "liberation" from the current development plan, among other things.
In the "exception" dealt with the permission of a special form with respect to the roof structure.
Accordingly, to be built a "gabled roof with non-center type First and roof overhang".
Background of the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: "This means we get a wonderful large south-facing roof together," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
In the "liberation" went there again to the roof slope, the energetic reasons - the manner not specified in the development plan - should be below ten degrees.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "strong" therefore became necessary because of the development plan with respect to the roof slope does not allow "exceptions" - said Bernrieder council moves rather restrictive usually in relief requests.
On the turn Hall is however not a recurring project: "We are creating a precedent," said Steigenberger.
The turn on hall sports center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
To cost around 2.3 million euros are discounted.
Grants are expected from the school and popular sports promotion.
In the next step of the planning application for the 18 x 36 meters will be presented large hall the district office for review.
