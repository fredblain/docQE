Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy strikes against rivals due to allegations wrestling back
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the Tackling his players as "agenda-setting" of two Premier League favorite NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have the Storm players "wrestling" allows his team during the high-Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled note to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "prime example" of Rugby League, saying that not "too good" were the two from Queensland in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the Tacklimg his team and said that they are focused only on their "Contact" at the tackle.
Bellamy added that the review of two leading trainer at his team confident vote him because it meant that they were concerned to be hit by Storm team.
"This comes up again and again - I did not hear that Trent Robinson talked about wrestling when she 24 us: have 2 hit," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing defensive in our system or the techniques throughout the year. But in the last six weeks we have made a real focus our contact in tackles, and has provided the turnaround for us.
Trent is now three years there, and he obviously has to train a great team. It is therefore probably not accustomed to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny how this keeps coming up this time of year.
Bellamy has Bennetts idea of "exciting football" attacked and remembers his mentor because Bennetts St. George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember that St George was criticized as a boring team in 2010, and Wayne said that he would not give a shit about.
But now he has a team that can play and which we consider interesting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game that you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all his own way of playing football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I build more confidence, because they say these things, because they are a bit worried having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game against Storm Roosters scored a higher result than the game Broncos against Cowboys.
The play of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not considered it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two further attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are making breaks and no points something exciting?
For me it is the match schedule.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet in a phase of it.
The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to either North or the receiving Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks next Saturday evening at Vorfinale in AAMI Park. Ticket sales will begin from next Tuesday morning.
