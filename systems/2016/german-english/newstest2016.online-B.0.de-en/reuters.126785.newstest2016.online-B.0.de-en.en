For slightly overweight diabetic weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data take a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight Loss surgery or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
Reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, have obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes proved to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study in 2007 used for the new study and compare between two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained at those non-surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal in 29th
Among those who underwent surgery, the diabetes disease broke up at 36% completely and 28% partially.
In the medically treated group of diabetic dissolved compared to fully only in one percent and partial only about two percent.
Moreover, the results in the checks of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group remained however stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - how is reflected in the level of hemoglobin A1c improved - did not reduce mortality in five years, so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% vs. 2.1%) and showed more of a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study was obese people an obesity surgery underwent, about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35, who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower", without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start weight to be taken seriously, as soon as the patient lies with his BMI 27 to 30
"I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that their bodies with obesity and diabetes firmly connected, a reversal is really hard. "
