Stevan Hogg used phone from girl to lure pedophiles on sending pictures
A pedophile used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl, as this was sleeping, logged onto an online messaging service, from which he received a number of indecent images of children that have been sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She saw it through, was the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
Police cared and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that have been found at the address and discovered "concerned" web searches, used the terms to search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed against the officers that he did it because it "would lead pedophiles on the Internet" to and he "pretended to be a police officer, to frighten them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were performed on the computer from him, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a cop to scare predators.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.
He said that he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head, when he drinks, and said he would then see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and the wines.
then you saw the indecent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and Playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty to the indictment, to have taken indecent images of children on June 14, last year, to have violated on 25 January this year against the pads and not in court for a hearing to be published on 24 March this year.
Defense attorney Gregory Sim asked that Hogg will not appear in the sex offenders' register, since one could argue that was to be found "no significant sexual element" in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October in order to obtain background information on social work.
Hogg has been granted in this case deposit, but was kept in custody for hearings on other cases pending.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
