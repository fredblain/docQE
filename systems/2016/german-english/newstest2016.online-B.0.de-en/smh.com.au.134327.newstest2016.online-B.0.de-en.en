Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install last year a spy in his barns and threatened to finish the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Division of Racing Victoria, claiming that because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, led by a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching Lady Tatai.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself found in difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at Lidaris that he can not explain.
He had 18 months held back because of the spying allegations and did not want it "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I had planned nothing to say, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that all comes out at once," Moody said.
They know that it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want his head held high walking around, and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them.
If they begin to think, I do not, then I should not be more coach.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had let off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Integrity Department had tried to spy on his stable.
"Eighteen months ago, sat Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I'll call when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to information about what I within my stables do deliver "Moody said on Racing.com.
They seem to believe that I'm a cheater.
If that is the case, they should certainly hold their noses because they have in trying to contain myself, failed.
Robert Roulston, Former. Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, President of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL were aware of at the time and still are today.
If me bring to the view that it is personally?
Has the RVL behave cowardly and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think out there, it's me.
Maybe they need to take away my license and cast me, and I have no doubt that what I say, they can now think about it.
But I am now arrived at the point where I do not care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will exert the pressure on them and urge them to come to a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration level of the coach have built up with the long-term cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he "could take his license over the table."
Moody, best known for its preparation of an undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the Race Day-treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horse's legs had been applied, which was against the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I need it to take full responsibility, "he said.
"One of my employees has erroneously applied the mud on the leg.
It could have been so last night.
It had all day yesterday may be so, what was that way.
It had also so on race day.
Moody could be faced with a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on race day. An investigation into this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all have seen that we need rules, but here one has gone too far," Moody said.
