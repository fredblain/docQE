Seehofer: "borders are not closed off"
In a lengthy telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) has akkordiert further action on the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not closed off.
The onward journey of refugees in the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there is now doing just the appropriate border control.
Special trains with refugees to Germany there will initially be no more.
The asylum seekers would however brought with regular trains to Germany.
Of the other EU Member States Pühringer demanded once more an enhanced solidarity in the refugee question.
That now Austria reintroduce controls at its frontiers, is for Pühringer "a logical consequence" of the action by the Germans.
