FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must stand before the match against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere, that it was only September and provided his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario is already that Wilshere sure at least the next four games for England will miss and, given its history is its participation in the next summer at the European sure still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had strong finishes last season after a separate ankle injury and had then found back again to his old swing during preseason.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that does not heal well.
This is no more matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his knuckles or with the injuries he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the inherent risk of further injury, always when a player tries to return in mid-season.
It also developed an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd. listed 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded the most days of injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement will continue in the injury rate during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat power," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will do it and it will go through a career of the way he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League campaign on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger makes a rotation within the teams.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to indulge a little breather," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo are unbeaten after 41 games, after which was launched "invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has the doctrine drawn from the last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope, with his management team to lead to his first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were in 2006 very close to it, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
