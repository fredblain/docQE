Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal against Malmo.
Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday, helping PSG to overtake Malmö.
Here are the game and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League started the season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo in Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but after they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute scored with a header.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish champions as they strive not just to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class match of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic missed opportunities in front of goal. He was later in the game against his hometown team and to the club with which he began his illustrious career in 1999, substituted.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League Therefore, it is a good start. 2: 0 win to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we in the course the season still need perfecting, "Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have scored one or two more goals not yet. "
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes in the Paris team back, which is a 2 weekend: could hold 2 draws on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division, but he was upstaged in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine winger was named the man of the PSG can take to the next level in Europe when he was acquired last month by Manchester United, and he indicated why, when he was running in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmö-defense before passing beautifully finished to Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, which was disappointed.
Malmö, the Celtic in a play-off hit to reach this stage, joined Anpiff with nine internationals in the field and was associated with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield lined up a tough opponent.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic who passed away on Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave itself to sometimes, with some bad passes and bad accounts, not the least of Ibrahimovic, who slips up alone in the first half with no less than five attempts and was then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, the Di Maria turned in a shot on the turn, which was deflected past Wiland from 52 minutes to the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season so after Ibrahimovic had fished a left flank by Maxwell.
This ended all thought that Malmö could come back into play, and only an excellent intervention by Wiland blank range to stop David Luiz, could hold the final low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi goal was disallowed at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Åge Hareide, admitted later that PSG played a class on his team, and the Norwegians said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year.
Since then we have played only in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
