Certainly David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
It is one thing to learn all parents soon: If your child likes a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems, to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister of The Lorax, in 1971 published environmental fable by Dr. Seuss decided.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of Super Camps, and continues: "funny, touching, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read to my children, because it always seems to give an image or message that we've been missing. "
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead a synopsis of the film version of 2012 reflects that added new characters and details to enhance the rather short original.
"In the midst of the walled city Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, hoping a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams by to see their desire to have a real tree takes place, "one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and in 1991 died, but completely unknown.
As if that was not suspicious enough would be: The plan submitted by Cameron text reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hoping a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, to win the girl of his dreams. "
Although he admits so, to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar. Here ends an unnamed boy, as the local environment by greedy, trees felling, thneed knitting Once-ler is despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a squatting, mustachioed creatures, "speaking on behalf of the Trees", devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task has been delegated to a helper who Lorax has not 20 times consecutively read a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super Camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's employees, but gave no further immediate comment.
