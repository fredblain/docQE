Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do it"
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is committed to meeting them.
What is in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum applicants are in this year, according to forecasts of the Ministry of the Interior to Germany, according to statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany even able to take a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated, given the unusual challenge determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do that."
What to expect Germany, provides the following overview.
be used by different forecasts between 350,000 (estimation of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) flats a year - and the next five years.
That's almost twice as much as is being built to date (250,000 apartments).
Dramatically the lack of housing is above all at affordable rental properties: annual fall 60000-80000 social housing out of rent control, and to this particularly favorable apartments also refugees apply.
Bundesbauministerin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is from the perspective of Pestel Institute: arise need 80,000 social housing units annually and it takes the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion a year to invest.
Agreement among scientists and Bundesbauministerin are that it must also give more tax breaks for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research is assumed that in the long term, with 55 percent of the fugitives may be employed in Germany.
However, the refugees were not systematically asked in Germany to their qualifications to help them get started, criticized Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
but is crucial for the integration of refugees, whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of migrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany there has been a change of regime, according Thränhardt: the ban on working for refugees to recognition of work.
While there was a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years earlier, this the applicant was reduced in November 2014, three months as well as the residence obligation, limited to a residence.
the view of the majority prevailed that refugees access to the labor market should be made possible faster - In the Company has - also because of the shortage of skilled workers.
A major hurdle for access to the labor market are missing knowledge of German.
So far there is no sufficient supply of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that most jobs are mediated by personal contacts.
The development of networks is therefore the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to work integration.
The Berlin school directorate has found that few refugee parents give their children to day care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: "For the uprooted parents, it is once very important, keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for Youth and Family in the Berlin Senate.
However, to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, distributed management handouts in different languages.
Should the demand for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise sharply, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about by allowing more schools.
In the countries students are prepared without knowledge of German welcome classes to teach.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
In them there is no shortage, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school directorate.
The German Student Union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle prohibits any State applicants or tolerated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin's Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has his attitude but now abandoned.
Studierwilligen refugees could access to college easier.
For refugees with a residence permit or submission to get any benefits under the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz more when they start studying.
The latter basically get no student loans because they do not fall within the circle of persons entitled BAföG.
Tolerated refugees had previously lived for four years in Germany to be BafÃ¶g entitled from 1 January 2016, this margin reduced to 15 months.
but these funding gap must be closed, ask Steffen Barney, Berlin State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
Students should immediately get student loans.
Islam will play a more important role, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually give Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law evolve to a new state-religion relationship.
Important would be the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, the professional care of the new arrivals.
The rights include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and should have some control options.
This includes the willingness to bravely combat religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday concern religious conflicts could be carried into them by Germany.
Those who wanted to deliver such conflicts in Germany, "immediately have their right to stay here, forfeited in Germany," he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He suggested that the Basic Law to translate in Arabic.
Integration is much more than today in future be an issue of the whole society.
This also explains the majority society will have to change, is the eradication of discrimination and racism more pressing.
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for nearly a decade, an anti-discrimination office and a General Act on Equality.
But he learns very slowly, as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organizations and stakeholders not white German have long been demanding and what international agreements such as the ICERD Germany undertake, must become a reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - to benefit of all.
Generally Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees medicine, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"Concerning Man- power and capacity, we can do that," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, should it flow into the system additional money.
To avoid bottlenecks, calls Montgomery, all comers equal hand over health card when registering.
Services provided may be charged later with the provinces.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to fob so many people with the limited catalog of services, the providing for the Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz.
Otherwise, go to work the doctors, especially the language barriers.
Even before this, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated migrants are poor aware of their disease than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, in doctors' offices would interpreter costs are covered, she asks.
Helped would many refugees but even with more general medical correspondents in emergency departments.
And with another diagnostic view.
Among refugee children as there were significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it related to HIV education.
With the partial other conditions would German doctors of their education here but clearly says Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not as difficult to detect". As for the shortage of doctors, whether by refugees maybe even relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed educational system, many refugees are even doctors.
However, to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their competence and perhaps again take exams.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill, according to estimates of the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recent study of the Technical University of Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee child traumatized arrives in Germany.
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering, among others, so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems, strong startle response and emotional numbness.
To prevent that symptoms would chronically, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees received psychotherapy.
Although can mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services make a request for psychotherapy, but processing takes usually several months.
In addition, would in the social services usually clerk or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness, decide whether a treatment is necessary or not.
This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.
