BBC should give EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not transmitted by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for being to place public service programs that are likely to see a smaller audience in hard controversial time slot against the popular shows of their rivals and from channels like BBC4.
After the BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time at Channel 4, unsuccessfully, to come into contact with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are or sends that would also shown clearly by non-subsidized rivals in order," Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee as part of its study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the license fee, which I medium or long term not consider it a good idea, you should give its production at least on programs that others do not, or in order.
Send The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to reach the widest possible support for its future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax programs financed, which could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both productions.
would Honestly other channels give their right arm for.
I struggle to see how this public television should be.
I do not think that this would reduce the BBC ever.
Johnson, a contractor for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 headed, said that the BBC was responsible for chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support. "
His comments on the most popular programs of the BBC give back what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, the BBC shows should sell like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs should go to BBC4 "where you pretty much the audience can not measure, but they carry out their tasks, and they can argue when their sanctimonious missions to justify 4 billion £ broadcast fees go, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
Place it in a window of time in which no one would ever see.
For broadcasting fee Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think, we all think that one here gets a great value for £ 150 per year, but for people, which is a lot of money for the £ 150, wonder if that's true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who testified on Tuesday before the Committee, demanded that the BBC should reconsider its Reithian mission, "to inform, to educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that there were 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should be and the public television channels in Australia Canada is an example take this change in "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships said Elstein, the BBC should do more. In areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of TV show, and go with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online
