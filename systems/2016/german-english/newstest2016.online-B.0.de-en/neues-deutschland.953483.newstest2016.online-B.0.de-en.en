The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestor of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called informer.
This property combines many also with the billionaire who wants to become US president.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for Aufreger.
Whether he xenophobic remarks, journalists As rude or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy disclosed - the candidates for the US presidency swirls campaigning vigorously on.
And scores well here.
That is also registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with Föhnfrisur many is a term in the wine-producing village on the wine trail.
Many in the 1200-inhabitant city is akin over tens corners with him.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think the following is somehow exciting, but are in their Kallstadter kind not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
Born Kallstädterin has an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring rotated, which is next to Trump the ketchup Heinz family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) also have their say - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in Kallstadt.
For king of hearts he did not put there.
Whereas there is respect for the work of the family, but also tend to think that Trump "has a bit of a loudmouth" was said Wendel.
Coincidentally loud the nickname Kallstadt have within, "The Brulljesmacher" - to High German: the informer, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of informers.
The Trump'sche success story began in 1885, emigrated when the future grandfather and the United States opened a place for gold mining.
Cornerstone of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York.
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: Your desire to return permanently in the home, was denied by the Bavarian State to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He had Trump not included because it was once cut down without permission, the Director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul had declared the film's release.
Trump is the grandson of "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of descendants.
He had repeated derogatory talk about Mexican immigrants in the United States and the construction of a border wall required to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just as the rumbles, is not so appealing," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative Trumps ( "The grandmother was born Trump, the grandfather was born Heinz").
The winemaker retired sees the Americans rather distant, "he is always so short-tempered".
Does he believe that Trump is not?
"I can not imagine," says the 72-year-old.
"He has never cared about Kallstadt".
The landlady Veronika Schramm mentioned some Kallstadter that a descendant of the Heinz family something donated during a visit to the church organ, which arrived in general good.
"I can not imagine the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
They think it would be better if he did not gain the election because "who has such radical views, I do not know if that's good."
If those in the United States were in charge at the time of his grandfather, would have been like him, "he would be there even never arrived".
"There are more interesting subjects than him," says winemaker daughter Sarah Buhler.
And as president?
"My President, it's not," she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe, even without the President Trump".
Wendel's film, was interviewed for the Trump long have seen 12,000 moviegoers in the US wakes up the interest.
