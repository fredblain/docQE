The people running their errands, partly fast pace, partly cozy loitering.
You control the two stations of Mannheim auto showroom at the Paradeplatz.
keep light rail.
Pulsating, plump life in glorious autumn sunshine and the middle four large panels each with the heading "Before I die I want" ....
The Ecumenical hospice aid made by this action attention to their 20th anniversary and looks quite confronted with mixed reactions.
"It comes to life, so we are with the action in the middle of the city and gone among men," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the World Hospice Support is available to passersby as for questions and interviews available as volunteers.
While many a passerby intervenes spontaneously chalk and set to "My Life in the affirmative", "read", "to the campers go through the United States", "stop the war" or "do not suffer long" adds stop other short , read, say phrases like "I'm not ready" and then move on.
Again and again develop on the outskirts of small discussion about the action per se, about life, dealing with dying.
Even Peter HÃ¼binger just locally.
"Only if I'm clear that for me sometime the end comes to this world, I can responsibly live", the Director of Social Service Agency of Mannheim, which is carrier of World Hospice help together with the Caritas says.
Therefore, this effective public action is good for 20-year-olds.
That would not be notified of any publicly on the panels, but is understandable, after all if it were a very personal thing.
The subject of death and dying was to be fraught with taboos, so the experience of Josefine Lammer, although just the hospice movement has contributed in recent years, much to the fact that open people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and funeral attendant is one of the volunteers of the first hour.
Through personal experience with the subject confronted, she read a lot of literature and decided to want to get involved in the euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Help sought volunteers per call, she had reported immediately and had been with the foundation in 1995 there.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied the patients and their families in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and hospice Saint Vincent.
All they are carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid good with their task and the experience and experiences gained from this.
"I see life from a different perspective, consider it precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of outpatient hospice Ecumenical service is free of charge and non-denominational independent.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from family and clubs allow the training and further training and supervision of death and grief counselors.
Every two years offered training for new employees.
The panels described on Saturday are now in the house of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6) issued.
Also there, additional personal wishes are written on postcards.
