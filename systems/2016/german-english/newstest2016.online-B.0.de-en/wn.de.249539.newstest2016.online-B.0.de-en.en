McLaren reserve driver Magnussen incapacitated ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo and stated that he had suffered the injury when he was thrown off the bike.
He rides the night race in Singapore at the weekend as little as a reserve driver for the two race drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in question, as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
