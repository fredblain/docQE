Experts criticize report by Public Health England on e-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), located Lancet joined by criticizing evidence of Public Health England (PHE) used in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Policy Report" last month, describing him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data in question and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extremely windy basis" on which PHE explained his main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and asked if the allegations "are based on rock or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies on the demonstration of efficacy is based should."
They said that the public expects the assertion of PHE that "is the current best estimate that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking," is based on a detailed review of the evidence and the modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who have been called to a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) to develop to their opinions about the harms of various nicotine containing products to result in a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting a company called Euro Swiss Health was its CEO earlier by British American Tobacco Central (BAT) should have received for an independent study.
He also wrote the references of BAT for public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants said the meeting, to obtain funds from an e-cigarette manufacturers, but not the financing, he is said to have previously obtained, according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting the members of the panel are not supplied, but can include several well-known E-Cigarette Champions, some of which specify an industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco pipe of PHE participated.
The research group "admits characteristically" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Capewell said that the allegations of PHE that "so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are used as a way to smoke for children or Non smoking" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that has already responded to the allegations of BMJ previously.
He said: "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifetime smokers die of his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison to, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence is and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative risks compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die every year from an illness related to smoking, and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year.
The clear presenting of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking represent, we fulfill our national responsibility.
