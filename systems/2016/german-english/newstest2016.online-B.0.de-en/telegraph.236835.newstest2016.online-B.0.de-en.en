Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe keeps false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, beginning of the year fell by a panel down the stairs.
He was unhurt, but the video of the event spread quickly through social media.
The opening of Parliament was marred by allegations of opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany the speech by Mr Mugabe with boos.
Last month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their cell phones, which they warned of disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The news comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
Warns the concerned Parliament members that the immunity ends in parliament, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said, led by Morgan Tsvangirai party was "concerned" about the dangers of the politicians.
