We need to move this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the head of a British listed in the FTSE100 index leader, also has her top team umstruktiert to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has gone to women exactly 50 percent of the team, including its management and CFO.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
