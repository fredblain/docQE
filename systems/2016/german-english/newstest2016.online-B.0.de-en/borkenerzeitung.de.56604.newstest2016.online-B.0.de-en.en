Pegida Poster brings Lebanese potato kebab idea
Potatoes or kebab?
It's both - in the potato pizza, the Oldenburg Takeaway owner Hani Alhay has developed.
Inspired by the phrase "potato instead Döner" on a poster of Pegida movement Alhay has potato and meat stuck together on a spit.
On the idea of a poster put him at a Pegida demonstration labeled "potatoes instead Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then a spit, which is equipped with Meat and Potatoes turns in his shop.
"That's multiculturalism for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has let the Lebanese now register with the Patent Office in Munich.
There she is protected, according to the authority recently as a utility model.
How much meat and how much potatoes skewer containing Alhay will therefore not reveal.
Only this: "It tastes even better together," he says.
Even with its customers the culinary understanding'm good.
