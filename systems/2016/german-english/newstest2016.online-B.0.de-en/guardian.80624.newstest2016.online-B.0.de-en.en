'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction in the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
Change the tiny nematode, the direction in the moment in which they are using sound pulses which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard, irradiated.
The pulses work by switching on of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method, called Sonogenetics, can be used in the ultrasound to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the method could one day replace the depth brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease gives ,
Nematodes usually respond not on ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out that amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures that TRP-4-called ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report Nature Communications.
To provide ultrasound-guided nematodes, altered genetically Chalasani the worms so that carry some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to changing creatures that sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the amended motoneurons.
The method has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists neurons switched with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves can pass through tissue without hindrance and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
