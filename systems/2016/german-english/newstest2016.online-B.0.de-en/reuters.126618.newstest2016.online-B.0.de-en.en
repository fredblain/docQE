Google launches doubling donation campaign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a doubling fundraising campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help the thousands of refugees who have overrun the European nations as they flee torn and impoverished by war countries ,
Google has an unusually personal approach when announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager making the announcement, Rita Masoud wrote a Google employee who has fled Kabul with her family when she was seven years old. about their personal experiences
"During our travels were many dark train and bus journeys, as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family desperately looking for help.
The donations will go to four charities that provide assistance to refugees and migrants are available: MSF, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million doubled to google.com/refugeerelief to $ 11 million.
Europe is confronted with his worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has sold more than 4 million people this year.
Many flee also from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
