Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented 2008 transfer to FC Bayern
World and European champions Xavi plays since summer 2015 for the al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar
Bayern was obviously a few years ago, shortly before the signing of Spain superstar Xavi, then playing for FC Barcelona.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four time Champions League winners, twice club champion, twice European champion, one time world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the now 35-year-old left after 24 years of FC Barcelona and joined the al-Sadd Sports Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca reveals Xavi now that he was before the Euro 2008 before departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won then all we have nothing," he says.
And that also recorded the FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
Reminder: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not materialize.
And the decisive man for now works for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça Guardiola contracted and I played a great championship."
"Pep told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me."
"So he got me."
Who knows how Bavaria Time had run 2008/2009 with Xavi.
Xavi was for Barca in the quarterfinals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, turned the Reds from (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the premier class triumph.
