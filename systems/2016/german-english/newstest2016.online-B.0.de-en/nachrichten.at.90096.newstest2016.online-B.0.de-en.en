That Viktor Orbán now sends more Thousands to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has high officially and publicly pushed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism.
Victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
The fugitives will have to find that the "promised land", which she has invited and welcomed, not as another refugee camp is.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and the approaching winter, make decent conditions for those seeking sanctuary with us.
And it will be even more - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
