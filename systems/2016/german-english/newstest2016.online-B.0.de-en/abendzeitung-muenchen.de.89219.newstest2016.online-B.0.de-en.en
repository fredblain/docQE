Munich, Sylt and Co .: The five exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive condominium - with views over the North Sea Watt.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched house on average will cost 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt supply is limited by nature of objects", according to the study - which is why so the high price.
A new study shows, in which specific documents cost a square meter at the most.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square meter for a student's room in Munich are not really little.

The Property Engel & VÃ¶lkers has a ranking of the most exclusive residential locations German published - with prices per square meter in dizzying heights.
There are times tens of thousands of euros nix - per square meter, mind you.
But well, who can afford it ...
Incidentally, Munich is here once not at the top.
