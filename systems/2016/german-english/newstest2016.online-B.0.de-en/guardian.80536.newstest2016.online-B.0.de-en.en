Luke Shaw Manchester United can not play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left back to the wines and will exclude him for at least six months from playing, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by HÃ©ctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He is laid tomorrow or maybe the day after surgery and then in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 for Manchester United, it was very difficult and then plays awesome, and then this happens.
In the dressing room he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then takes the six months, he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card, and the imposition of a penalty kick.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both feet.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages Words can not describe how broke I am, my road to recovery starts now, I'll be back stronger again.."

The England defender has with the European Championship in France, to recover an additional incentive to the next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
If a player with this type of injury leaves the place, they are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team in the 2014 World Cup.
"He finds it very difficult, because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy, and then you hear that it is a very bad injury, which is not good," Cocu said.
For me it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was traveling in a different direction, so that it looked as if he had [Moreno] touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know, may be such a thing as hard.
I feel very bad about it. I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andres Guardado was also taken to hospital - for a foul by Chris Smalling.
