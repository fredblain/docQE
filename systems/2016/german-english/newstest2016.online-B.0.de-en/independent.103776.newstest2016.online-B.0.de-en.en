iOS 9: How do you get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be obtained by going to the Settings app, tap "General" and then select "Software Update".
When it is ready, gives the phone the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered after installation problems because they receive an error message that tells you that the "Software update failed" is.
To work around this problem, users are recommended either to wait until the rush back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
That may mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made this less likely by the streamlining of the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if one uses a special tool to remove Apps, and then re-install, once the process is complete.
It pays to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow that the update will proceed because the phone may shut down halfway, and this could lead to an interruption of the update.
