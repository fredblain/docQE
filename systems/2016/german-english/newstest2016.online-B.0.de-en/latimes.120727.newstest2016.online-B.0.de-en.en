At its most anticipated meeting in years Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table in order to decide whether it's time for the first time in nearly a decade to raise the key interest rate.
Threatening is above them at one end of the ornate, two-story courtroom a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: keep maximizing US employment and prices here stable.
But since the great recession the Fed leaders recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor is a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented stimulus by the lying close to zero short-term interest rates since the end of 2008.
Although most of the data of the economy show that it grows strong, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to strengthen this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and even if only by a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the rate of interest is the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do what insecure in themselves the financial market.
About half of the economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed Waiting, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This points to a decline of the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless that strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy maintains the set this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets, so they do not panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets, because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on track to set to increase by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the US.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer, that they that more economic progress would be needed this year, despite the complaints of liberals, expecting an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs in August slowed, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation constantly proceeded with the annual target of 2% of the central bank, said the Fed's representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tightening of the labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world jumped end together last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its peak, feared as investors that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would curb global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, the Dow is now up by almost 10% below the May high.
For the Fed's representatives the turmoil affecting the complex calculation when they should raise interest rates.
"If the events in financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the past few weeks had not occurred, it would in this session the reins tighten," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
He predicts that they'll wait at least a month to get the effects better grip.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so they should be technically involved in their decision making.
But in the end the Fed monetary authority in the world has become.
The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years.
The mere statement of the then head Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "narrow" its monetary expansion, sparked confusion from around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly interlinked, can be expected from the Fed representatives, that they not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to a better understanding of the to obtain global economy.
Your decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of the company Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., Noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that are not associated with apparently with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de's commitment to raise interest rates, citing decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited discernible effect on growth in the US," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed's representatives made these cuts reversed.
The Fed should put questions of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the collapse of the market in 2008 in the first place, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the interest rate down the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil do not come close to this level, he said.
"You will not surely fall into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest rates, because the markets are upset," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and did not mention the financial stability, and to the changes, I do not think that they should run ahead of time.
