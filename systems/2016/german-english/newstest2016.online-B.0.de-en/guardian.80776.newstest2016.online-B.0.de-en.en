Eight golden rules for living in student dormitories
Eleven years ago I pulled a self-forgetful 19-year-old in a college dorm, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I have gotten - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about other ,
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student residences ranges from slightly unnerving to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to talk: tell people where you come from, if and where you took sabbatical where you stand in terms of Corbyn and why you "honestly Marmite neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room. "
Breathe.
And you help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find the people you love, as opposed to those with whom you would not talk, even if your lashes caught fire and this fire extinguisher would.
Let people.
The rooms of people transform themselves often in drinks receptions, movie night venues and local meeting places, but they are also the places where people get dressed and straighten her underwear.
Then based: Do not think to start at the university with a relationship
Introverts get a rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refuge, but many halls of residence form a room-to-room spree culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say "I like you, and I want our friendship goes on, but you have to go away for me to get back the energy that I have used for interacting with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of knocking.
knock Speaking: Do it.
A guy in my halls of residence had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make friends by baking.
As you begin university at the peak of the back-mania, is knocking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brownies, less strange as the greeting of the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have you baked something. Well, now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions. "
offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommate feel obliged to entertain themselves and so perhaps associate your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent bakery.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people ask to be asleep when you knock.
stealing food, is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but it is taking a drop of lactic your tea also?
Check the milk with the owner.
Chances are that they say themselves to use, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that's annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to make a balanced deal than my roommate, who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in jail.
You should not make any noise, the people from sleep or from work keeps.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but you are in the truest sense of the saying to the people who sit in glass houses.
A girl on my hallway asked their neighbors if it makes them a little to make drum & bass a little quieter because there three in the morning, and she had a morning examination.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 am, they let their neighbors kindly sleep another two hours before they could blare their own music, completed her door and went to their three-hour examination.
Would not it romantic if your future spouse would happen to move in the same dorm?
Conversely, it would not profoundly embarrassing when you hold a roommate for your future spouse to ranmachen them, separate again and they then have to see every day and perhaps witness how pulling them all together to be friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but when a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try your abdomen persuade some reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has leave his keys in his not locked room, the line between a joke and bullying is more subtle than it seems.
A good trick is fun, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Grant by hiding a valuable and entertaining lesson about safety - but you never screw up one's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Seal your door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but you tackern their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice firmly.
