Servians with $ 200,000 bail after drug charges
A man, to risk of a life sentence for attempting to take possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland, was released on bail of $ 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men who last month were arrested after the Federal Police 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay found that came from South America and Vanuatu docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed, as he met his co-defendants in the marina during the morning and later in the caf√© Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, argued the lawyer Maksimovic that there was no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount and that in the cafe could have been a harmless ground.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the risk of absconding with Maksimovic.
He has clear relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia, "he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had a deposit of $ 200,000 jointly offered as collateral to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of two persons, it is clear that the issue of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him, not to appear, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that it gives off its Australian and his Serbian passport, logs daily to the police and a curfew from 18: 00 holds: 00-06.
