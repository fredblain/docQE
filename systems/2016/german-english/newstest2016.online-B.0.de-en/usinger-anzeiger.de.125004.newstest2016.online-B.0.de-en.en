Spacecraft "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice crust of Saturn moon Enceladus spills a global ocean.
The researchers conclude from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit around the ringed planet.
While this wobble is only small, but too large for a continuous solid celestial bodies, according to a release from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis before in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be under the ice from Enceladus liquid water.
So "Cassini" had been discovered in 2006 at the South Pole ice volcanoes of Saturn moon that spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded that time.
The extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
