halved Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll: Election-2016
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins her over ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries.
More than five months before the primaries, say most Democratic voters that it is too early to say that their opinion, it is clear which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice.
Since the CBS News poll has Clinton at a number of demographic groups lost while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but those projections have decreased.
Your support for men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is lagging behind with only 5 points.
Clinton's advantage in Democratic voters under age 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was before Sanders double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters say the primaries nationwide that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she nominated by the party.
A quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would support only because it is the candidate.
Six percent would not support.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly impressed by it.
The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support it enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters primaries say they support Clinton enthusiastically, say less Republican voters this via their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters will be asked in an open question as to why they want to be the candidate, the most common answer is that they did (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time the right experience that a woman President (13 percent) and that they are the best candidate for the job (10 percent) is.
From Clinton's supporters also their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent) is mentioned.
Approval for dealing with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president casts a potential run for president in the balance, want to see him in the race, 57 percent of Democratic voters of the primaries - although one third believes that he should not do it.
If democratic voters the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, is Biden at the top.
From Clinton's supporters say more than half that Biden would be their second choice long before Sanders.
Biden opts not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton increases lead over Sanders, 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the election; However, this figure of 78 percent has fallen in the past month.
Biden is by far a second in this measurement, but the percentage who sees him as the "w√§hlbarsten", has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is more important in a candidate, call Democratic voters questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month stands not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters primaries emerged as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidate or potential candidate give good results in some important traits in voters of their party primaries.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership skills.
Biden cuts in the three candidate came out on top with honesty while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters primaries see also generally Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all of these measurements has about a quarter of Democratic voters no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton's use of a personal e-mail address and a server during the tenure as Secretary of State continue to be made, most Democratic voters the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has their opinions in total not affected.
But there is another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement, while only about a third is satisfied.
Public opinion this was in March, shortly after the problem came to light split.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsened by it.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say that their views of Clinton have worsened.
Although Clinton is viewed by voters of their party as honest and trustworthy, this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total: they see only 32 percent as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of the electorate do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time see 55 percent of the electorate nationally and Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy to.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good grades executive.
Of the six candidates tested cutting Biden, Carson and Bush came out on top with honesty.
A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with many Carson have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
