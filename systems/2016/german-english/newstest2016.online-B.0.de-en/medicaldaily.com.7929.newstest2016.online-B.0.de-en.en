Brazil Pediatric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS attempted to elucidate shockingly women about the importance of good nutrition during lactation. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on breasts, which are painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, which give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements pregnant women and young mothers are advised of their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day increase.
However, new research findings suggest that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them against the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child negatively affect the immune system.
