Jarryd Hayne had several options to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams, the end of last year sent requests for his impressive open training day.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision from.
Some coaches have banned for the rest of the game on the bench, as he so lost a scramble, as did the Aussie rugby league convert his first punt return during Tuesday's 20-3 win over Minnesota Hayne.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also in the running game after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game.
Instead his rookies before the rest of the team to grind through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sportscaster Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and to take care of the next game.

It certainly was not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian followers for his NFL debut had hoped.
Hayne left after the fumble cursing the pitch and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have worse start to his NFL career imagine
"That was a thing that happens now time, it only cares about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the blunders with his Origin debut at that time in 2007, as a pass resulted in his own in-goal area for a try for Queensland.
Overall it was still a great experience for the 27-year-olds.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, keeping an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
