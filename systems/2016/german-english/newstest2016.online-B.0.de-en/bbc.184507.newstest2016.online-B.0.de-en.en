The head of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers."
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset higher labor costs in his company, he says.
The cost could make the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer new jobs.
