Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still difficult
Against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if the squad that was selected for the tour of England, is a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.
"I would not rule out a victory.
Alastair Cook's side may have less than three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting and fielding, and the community spirit is strong; they will bear no scars of 2012, only a youthful, positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali as a spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at test level, is an option for the attack.

The decision to leave Adam Lyth, of course, is for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven Tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are focused on results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, that led to the nomination - and I have said this before - players are their own best chooser.
Long ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he beats out more runs for Yorkshire, another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he is not so good services, and this does not surprise me; he is first and foremost a team man.
The question of how much time a test-shot man gets to his character, is difficult.
Lyth had seven chances - as Sam Robson got in front of him - while Nick Compton nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away.
The only criticism I can make is that England was Jonathan routine first began in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top shape - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex disaster comes in, and he is a man, and I have.
He is an X-Factor-cricketers in Yorkshire we saw early in this season, when he 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch was what hit us.
He must be at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen alongside Cook beat what an extra spin-Bowler and provide four Quicks would receive, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why a man could not beat, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a vicious bastard of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for them, and there is no difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an opener.
He has managed three hundred runs immediately and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him, he has impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his statistics, an average of 31 to 35 with the bat and with the ball - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka batsman out, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience, having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood for the white-ball stage of the tour and will bring energy and a powerful presence in the setup.
I always felt that he was on the international cricket competition is created, as a player or as a coach, and how he had Mahela insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes, new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the dressing room, even if the messages are consistent with the previously said.
Collys teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team director do not determine the timetable.
And you must remember that their jobs depend on the players from the results.
Such decisions are taken not with a light heart.
