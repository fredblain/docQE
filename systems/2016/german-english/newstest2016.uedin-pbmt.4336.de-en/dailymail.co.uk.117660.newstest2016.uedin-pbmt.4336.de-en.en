Hundreds of Muslims gathered, as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collapsed at the Grand Mosque Mekkas.
Mourning filled, mostly dressed in white, the route to pay their respects, as the first of the dead on their final journey to the Al-Moaissem-cemetery.
The funeral procession moved over at the holy site, where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque and then the praying.

The bodies of 29 Betern, who were killed when a crane through the Great Central Mosque Mekkas crashed, were carried through the streets.
Among the dead, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage, when the crane crashed down.
Akram was MR mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the Great.

Today, said King Salman, the Bin Laden Group, the arm of the crane would not stand to leave when he was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service, the news agency reported that detail, but said that the leadership of the company were banned from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that fell into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj pilgrimage, which takes place later this month.
The Bin Laden group has no statements about the collapse of a crane, and their representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also chided the group for not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mekkas Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project, the Bin Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family for decades, is connected with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a renegade son, who in the 1990s was disowned by the family.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just a few days before arrival of millions in the UK the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime of every Muslim is required for healthy.
Officials said that 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials ordered that 1 million rial (Â£174.000) are to be paid to the families of those killed and injured in the same amount.
