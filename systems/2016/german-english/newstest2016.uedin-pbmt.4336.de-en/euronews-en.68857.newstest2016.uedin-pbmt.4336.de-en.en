The decision on interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching, if the US Federal Reserve in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, come together to make the important decision to make, whether for the first time in nearly a decade, the interest rates will be raised or not.
A survey of 80 economists who were interviewed by Reuters, found that a little more than half who only last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now that the Fed will remain a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it is seven years since the Fed set interest rates at zero.
"For the first time, we are moving towards a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero-field and a process of normalisation of interest rates will start," said Angel Ubide, chief researcher at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is in a relatively good performance, trillion will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move.
The decision is at 8 p.m. CET on Thursday will be announced
