Disney plans new stage adaptation of "Mary Poppins"
Legends should not be touched, but still Disney ventures in a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins."
This is according to "Entertainment Weekly," but not a Parisian, but a kind of continuation, 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the experience of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the Great Depression in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, is still unclear.
But the director is clear: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" at the cinema.
