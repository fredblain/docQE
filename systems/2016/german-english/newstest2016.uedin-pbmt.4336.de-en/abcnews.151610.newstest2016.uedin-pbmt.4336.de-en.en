UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says that his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons, violence and misery for millions of people, only worse.
The UN chief once again urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly to meet later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers are "impossible to solve this situation."
Ban urged the five permanent members, to show in dealing with the crisis in Syria, the same solidarity and unity that they have in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
