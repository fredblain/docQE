Jewelry will net curtain - "top as a fashion niche
Previously, it was the long embroidery machines in Plauen to make yards.
The embroidered fabrics and lace in large quantities for customers who, for example, processed them with blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer works, Andreas Reinhardt, CEO of fashion tip Plauen explains.
Instead, the fashion is important.
In the early days of the "top fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: Lead in jewellery, accessories such as handbags and in regional costumes.
Put all the so-called vintage fashion, which in past eras, a growing job potential.
Anyone who served in the textile industry in Germany is not a niche that is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen is a member, along with nine other companies in the industry association "lace and embroidery.
Only they are allowed to carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales are there.
Private shops and wholesale, there is almost no more.
Our products reach the customers in this way.
Today's mass-produced goods will be cheaper in Asia and sold almost exclusively on chains.
In addition, the export schwächle, after Russia and the United States.
So plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association is trying to score points by environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer said of the stick pearl in Falkenstein: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable manner."
Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the snow Berger of West Saxon University of Applied Sciences Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specialises in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from Asia, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of designers and companies, especially the need to think economically, "says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often vary only slightly to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic pyramid top.
The machine uses small beads in some places.
The Goldsmiths "champion Bianca Hall Bach did it inspire Krauße became:" Before, I couldn't deal with traditional "top."
Now she uses the snowball head for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region to identify with the subject" tip - young and old, "says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want a memento.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of "tip.
