Peter Moody claimed that stewards attempted to spy on him and threatens to end the racing
Peter Moody claimed that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried last year to install a spy in his stables and threatened to end the race immediately.
He appealed to the stewards and the Integritäts Department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they have a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai due to a race-day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions, as the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris was that he could not explain.
He had 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want it to look like "high-hanging grapes."
"I was going to say nothing about it, and I have sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once, Moody said.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to walk with my head held high, and I want my owners think that I will try my best for them.
If they start to think, I am not doing that, then I should no longer be coach.
Then I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody's had the bomb in an interview with racing.com high let go that the Integritäts department tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man, whom I will call when I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information about what I am doing in my stables," Moody said on Racing.
You seem to believe that I am a cheater.
If that is the case, surely they should be on their noses because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of at the time and it still is today.
This should bring me to the view that it will personally?
The RVL Hat behave cowardly and perhaps people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there thinking that I am there.
Maybe they have to give me my license and I run, and I have no doubt that what I say, think about it.
But I am now at the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.
This makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The levels of the trainer is to have the long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari, and the late scratching meant that he said that he was "his license could throw on the table."
Moody, best known for its preparation of the master's unbeaten Black Caviar, described the race-day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay on the horses legs had been applied, which was against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I have to take the full responsibility for it, "he said.
"One of my employees has mistakenly applied mud on the leg.
So it would have been last night.
It would have been all day yesterday, which was the case.
But it was also so on race day.
Moody with a three-month disqualification for the treatment to be confronted with the pack on race day, and opened an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here they have gone too far," said Moody.
