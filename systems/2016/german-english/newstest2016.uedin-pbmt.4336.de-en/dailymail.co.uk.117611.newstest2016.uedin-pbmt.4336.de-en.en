BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbing down"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The bathrooms smelt
House-colleague Damien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, a leading member of parliament and new claims increased pressure on the broadcaster to prove that he is doing something that the private sector do not.
The Conservative MP Andrew Bingham said the BBC bosses that public service radio station "verdumme" and increasingly unable to distinguish from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems to be - I use the word" verdummen "not like - but it seems to turn on Classic FM," he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, seem to be The bathrooms smelt just under a different name.
So if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you really only "imitate what is already on the market, said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director-General dismissed the accusations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors, when it comes to live music and educating the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, which I will learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and new works, I think is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, Radio 3 controller Alan facilities that should be working harder to engage the audience argued the BBC, as it did in the past, because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only element of the BBC production, during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture, media and sport, it came under fire, commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the musical talent show on the BBC, the Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of Â£22 million was purchased.
Take a look at why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as a judge - "on a special BBC way" was produced.
He added that he wished that the company "is a hit from our barn," when we start the next time an entertainment series.
However, he refused to order for another series of The Voice in the future, or to exclude the fee payers money for other entertainment formats.
