Surely David Cameron The Lorax knows better?
There is one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
As a provider of childcare systems was asked his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister opted for The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. / he.
It is a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company super camps, and continues: "It was funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children, because it always seems to be an image or a message that we've been missing."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, but a summary of the film version of 2012, the new characters and details added to the relatively short text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and the air is a commodity, is hoping for a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win by their desire to see a real tree," reads one. Dr. / he was a love interest, whose real name was Theodor / he hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text proposed by Cameron reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax's film, on the website of the Internet Movie Database, and so begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, hopes a boy named Ted, the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams to win."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book is so unfamiliar, hears an unnamed boy, as the local environment by the greedy, trees cases, Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the name Lorax, Hock, schnurrb√§rtigen nature, "that" speaks on behalf of the trees, is devastated.
Most likely, it was such a relatively low PR task delegated to a helper, The Lorax not 20 times in a row, read to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but had no further immediate comment.
