Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We create the"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to adopt them.
What lies ahead for Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will come after predictions of the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year after Germany, according to Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is even able to absorb a million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination, given the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we do it."
What is in store for Germany, conveys the following overview.
Used to be, according to various estimates between 350000 (estimate) and the German Federal Ministry of 400,000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as previously (250000 homes will be built.
Dramatically, however, is the lack of housing, especially affordable rental properties: 60000-80000 per year falling out social housing from the rental price, and the affordable housing will apply as refugees.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) intends to double the funding, currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute: 80 000 social housing should occur annually, and the federal funding of EUR 6.4 billion per year.
Agree scientists and federal minister of construction is that it must also give more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research, 55 percent of the countryside can be employed in Germany in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them start, criticised Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also the self-esteem of immigrants, migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt says.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political shift: The work ban for refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was once a work ban on asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence requirement limits the asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In the view of society - is also due to the shortage of - mostly enforced that refugees should be allowed for faster access to the labour market.
A big hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of German.
So far, there is still no sufficient supply of general and work-related language courses.
Moreover, studies show that most jobs are conveyed through personal contacts.
The development of networks is, therefore, in the opinion of Thränhardt the royal road to integration.
The Berlin school administration has noted that few parents from giving their children in day-care centres, there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent, "for the displaced parents is very important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, managing leaflet distributed in different languages.
The demand for teachers is rising due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by not allowing multiple schools.
In countries without knowledge of German pupils in classes to be prepared for the classroom.
But they are not always taught by fully qualified teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from teachers who have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, Beate Stoffers says of the Berlin school administration.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state asylum seekers or indulgent prohibits the study - the only exception Berlin interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has so far but now has abandoned its stance.
Studierwilligen refugees could be facilitated access to university.
As refugees with a stay of reimbursements or receive no benefits under the current law more asylum seekers when they begin their studies.
The latter have basically no Bafög, since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to trainees.
Refugees waited until now had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be Bafög-entitled, from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.
This funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen crash, Berlin's Secretary of State for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
The students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
Islam, the state should grant the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state-church law to a new state-religions-relationship develop.
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, the professional cares for the newcomers.
To the rights and obligations.
The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact and be prepared to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some control.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Ayman Mazyek, said on Thursday the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany have, "for her right now, here, in Germany, forfeited, he said in the Bavarian Radio.
He proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more so than today, be a matter of the whole society.
The majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade, an anti-discrimination and a general equality law.
But it is very slow, as the spirits-murder series showed that the police and authorities are systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and stakeholders not white German demand for a long time and which require international agreements such as the anti-racism convention, must become a reality in the next few years, if the country will remain peaceful and its new citizens to exploit their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to provide the expected refugees medically, doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.
"As far as a power and capacity, we create that," he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, this extra money to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery wants to distribute to all arrivals when registering for health cards.
Services could be charged later with the Länder.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to fob off so many people with limited services, the law stipulated that asylum seekers performance.
Otherwise, the doctors make the language barriers.
Until now, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown that migrants are informed about their illness worse than other patients.
Not only in clinics, in doctors "offices interpreting costs would have to be accepted, she says.
Many refugees would be helped but also with more general medical correspondents in emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people go for HIV awareness.
With some of the other diseases German doctors would come from their training, but clearly, Montgomery says.
"Parasite infections or tuberculosis are not so difficult to discern." And as far as the shortage of doctors, even through the refugees might be relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practise, but they would have to prove their qualifications and may drop again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK) mentally ill, most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, said Dietrich Munz, President of BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Anyone who is suffering from a post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from so-called flashbacks with breathlessness, dizziness, palpitation and Todesängsten.
Other symptoms of sleep and concentration, strong shock and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent the symptoms would be chronic, early treatment needed, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum-seekers in the social services can make a request for psychotherapy, but the process usually takes several months.
In addition, officers or doctors who are trained for mental illness would not usually in the social services, decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to miscalculations, Munz said.
