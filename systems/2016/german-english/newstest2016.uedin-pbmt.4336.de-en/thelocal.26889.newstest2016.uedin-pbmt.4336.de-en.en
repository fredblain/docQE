Here's the match report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept course, as Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Princes Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PSG, the French champions on the road, but then they missed a series of chances before they finally increased their lead when Cavani in the 61st minute a Kopfballtor.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donetsk in Group A Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, because they not only the qualification for the K.O.-Runden, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-final in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blancs team with real Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal, and he was later in the game against his hometown team, and against the club with which he began his illustrious career began back in 1999, changed.
"It is not easy to win at home and away in the Champions League, so it is a good place to start looking back, 2: 0 to win, and to cause problems for our opponents, even if there are certain things that" over the course of the season, we still need to improve, "Blanc said.
"This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals. "
Who returned after his injury in one of three changes to the team back in Paris, at the weekend, a 2: 2 draw against Bordeaux on home ground in the league could hold, but it was in the fourth minute by Di Maria trumped.
The Argentine wing striker has been described as the man, the PSG to the next level in Europe can take when he last month was taken over by Manchester United, and he hinted at why he in Marco Erzähler TTI pass behind the Malmö-defense ran into it before he passed on Johan Wiland well long into the corner of the net.
If anyone believed, however, that PSG would achieve a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, Celtic beat in a play-off to reach this stage, joined by National Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a five-man defence and two deep in the midfield lined up a serious opponent.
But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away at Kevin Music post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves sometimes, with some bad passes and poor qualifications, not least from Inter, patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the reboot.
Nevertheless, he proved a lot more skill, when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from Inter, Di Maria turned in a low shot which by Wiland in the 52nd minute was turned past the post...
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer scored his sixth Saisontor after Inter left flank of Maxwell had been exploited.
That ended any thoughts that Malmö could come back into play, and only a superb intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz was the end result, keep low, before substitute player was Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, was later that PSG was a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which does not have the same level.
The qualifying games are not enough. "
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
