"Cassini space probe finds" ocean on Saturn moon Enceladus
Under the Eispanzer Saturnmonds of Enceladus is a global ocean.
The researchers conclude from observations made by the Cassini space probe "."
Thus, the moon is teetering on its orbit around the planet.
This tumbler movement is only small, but too big for a consistently solid celestial body, reads a statement of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York (Tuesday).
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus."
It was already known that there must be under the ice on Enceladus liquid water.
So "Cassini had already" 2006 covering the Saturnmonds discovered ice-volcanoes that spew out water vapor and Eispartikel and thus the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At the South Pole, at least, there should be an underground sea, astronomers concluded at the time.
The extension of the hidden ocean was not resolved.
