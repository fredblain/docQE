For slightly overweight diabetics can be helpful for weight loss surgery.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes, according to a new study may take at least five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight-loss surgery live longer than those who received non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to get something to show," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight-loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods in order to reduce the size of the stomach.
You reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, have obesity-surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficient, but most studies have been carried out by people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to height, is considered normal is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

For the new study, researchers used from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital data since 2007, they have collected in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who undergo this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI was among those non-surgical diabetes treatments were roughly equal at 29.
Among those who have undergone surgery, with 36% of the total diabetes disease and at 28%.
In the medically-treated group disintegrated completely diabetes compared to only one percent, with only about two percent.
In addition, the results were in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol "generally better in the 'surgical' group," the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient's blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept under 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c levels fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, remained stable at around 8%.
But this better "glycemic control" - as in the improved hemoglobin A1c levels - not reflect reduced the mortality rate in five years, so the Chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year had the bypass surgery group compared to the gastrectomy group lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes (million vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage for surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study was in obese people who are subjected to an obesity surgery, about 29 percent less likely over the course of 15 years of dying - compared to a group that tried conventional methods.
Although the new study no advantage for survival in the surgery patients showed, Blackstone said, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in the lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start to take seriously weight, once the patient with a BMI between 27 and 30.
"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that a reversal "as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their body with obesity and diabetes is hard, really hard.
