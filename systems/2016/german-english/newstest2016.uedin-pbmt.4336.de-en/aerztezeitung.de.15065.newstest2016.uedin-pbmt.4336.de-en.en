Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Smokers not only harms the lungs, but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news: The risk of abandonment is falling fast.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
It emerges from the long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees of the German Institute of Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers, the risk of losing their teeth prematurely, the 2.5 to 3.6-fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than 23.300 participants.
Main causes of tooth loss are dental caries and inflammation of the meat, DIfE stressed.
For these periodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors say.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss, go back to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who stop smoking, reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, "the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research."
However, it could take more than ten years until the threat to sinke back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham, England.
We need to convince people to be non-smokers, study director Heiner Boeing from DIfE declared: "Smoking shortens the life."
Not to smoke in the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our knowledge is good to a good dental health well into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population over the age of 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, DIfE said.
Previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study, the findings untermauere.
