Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the royalty, and I realize that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The film begins, and it comes to my mind, that I am a simuliertes yawn and an arms length from the Princess of Wales with a date.
"Back in Time," a documentary about "Back to the Future," presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, along with Robert Zemecki's director and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "no doubt the greatest time travel movie that was ever made."
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
