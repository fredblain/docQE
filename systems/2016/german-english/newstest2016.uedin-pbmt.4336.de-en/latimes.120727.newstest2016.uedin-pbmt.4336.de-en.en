At their most anticipated meeting in years Fed strategists spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table, to decide whether it is time, for the first time in almost a decade to raise the federal funds rate.
Loom over them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting hall there is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the nation above all other things to do.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: The US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision, which is too close to predict, it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 to be weaned.
Although most of the economic data show that it is solid, the recent turmoil in global financial markets already cautious Fed officials are fearful that this volatility by increasing the interest rate for Bunds to increase - if only by a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be first and foremost the most important thing they" observe, Lindsey M. Piegza, Chef√∂konomin at brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said
"But I think if they were looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate is not the increased uncertainty is to wait around the global market enough justification to continue," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do what insecure themselves in the financial market.
About half of the economists who were recently surveyed by Bloomberg, have forecast a rate hike this week.
The financial markets expect a wait of the Fed, with a key indicator, showing only a 30% chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises rates, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raise rates at this time would be, "he said.
If it does, "they would have to go very far in its statement to calm the financial markets, so that they do not end up in panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had in the spring and early summer said that this year, despite the complaints from liberals that more economic progress would require an increase in the rate expected.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and close to the levels that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation is below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed officials said that the main reason for the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the strain on the labour market," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
But the financial markets around the world together zuckten late last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in May by more than 16% below its all-time high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now down by almost 10% lower than in May.
The Fed representatives influence the market turbulence, the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy over the past few weeks had not occurred, they would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that it will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the impact.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the global economy is not the main concern of the Fed, so technically they should not be involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the central bank was enormously in recent years.
The mere hint of then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed's monetary expansion could "narrow" triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, representatives from the Fed can be expected to not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks and experts advise to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is "more art than science," Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy, said the asset management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not associated with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, is campaigning for a rate hike, cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should only include aspects of financial stability during a severe crisis like the 2008 market collapse in the first place, Adam S. Posen, a former member of the committee, said the interest rate set by the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"You will certainly not get into a situation where they fear a rise in interest rates, because the markets" are concerned, Poznan, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not believe that they should jump ahead of time.
