Five members of the Brotherhood, with the death of a Baruch College-newcomer charged
Nearly two years after a student died during a fraternity ritual bullying in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, to be filed murder charges against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 to brutal and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, the police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged, and have been repeatedly attacked while he tried on a frozen field to reach a goal.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi-Brotherhood called the emergency number 911 after Deng was powerless and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, according to the police.
But you had the time to change Deng's clothes to googled his symptoms and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, in order to obtain advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide equipment and the welfare of the Brotherhood were fundamentally about what Michael Deng," Police Chief Wagner said.
He could not be revived, and he died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report Deng were repeatedly dealt with blunt force injuries to the head, trunk and legs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood, and at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the harassment," said Douglas Fier Berg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Congregations, and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County grand jury recommended charges of third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, also be charged with religious attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We want to make not only the individuals involved, but if there is one organisation that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will also be accountable for this," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.
