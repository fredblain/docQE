Detroit Tigers at Minnesota Twins creep over
MINNEAPOLIS--Die second half of the season for the Detroit Tigers, was not particularly funny.
Previously, they were once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, but played his part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to climb within a half game of Houston retired for the second American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return to the three-letter F-word, which has a large part of the second half of the season was so hard to take.
"All victories are fun, no matter how it comes," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon gave his early offensive support, as Detroit three times in the first two innings scored, then again in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) struck out 6 times in the 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year," Simon said.
It is hard to throw in the Bullpen every game, and that is why I want to go very concentrated on the game.
The designated Tiger pitchers Victor Martinez had three hits and drove in two runs, wrote his first since mid-August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has swung the wood well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in training at the (strike), looked much better in the Bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the background at the end of the seventh innings, the Twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double to the left-field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks had a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Browns Brian Dozier to Strikeout, before he was replaced by the left-handed losing Hardy.
Hardy was on the wall, the only man with whom he was facing before the designated rookie-blow man Miguel Sano, the right-handed Drew Verhagen grabbed a Two-Run.
With a pair of runners and the end-run the second Verhagen brought the third Browns Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It was the 27th in Major League-leading time this season that Plouffe suggested a Double Play
After Detroit at the end of the ninth innings added an insurance run, Wall was a RBI-double against the Tigers Closer Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
However, the right-handed sprang from Sano in three pitch for his fifth save.
Detroit was at the beginning of the game by not moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers have scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who before the game from the injured list had been removed after suffering because of a spine had been missing more than a month.
Hughes "obviously not the start that I have liked," said, "but I felt more comfortable than I'd loslegte and felt that I create some pretty good pitch in the third inning."
When she first received the Leadoff-Matty, Hushes gave a single Browns Ian Kinsler at second.
A two-out walk to J.D. Martinez, Victor Martinez into the game, a single "up the middle" in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the Runnern in scoring position.
The third Browns Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right side, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers came in the second, got a one-out double by Dreamcatcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big blow," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He has not done particularly well, but he has found the right place.
Hughes was on a pitch count, no points scored in the third inning before he the right-handed Reliever A.J.Achter was replaced.
When Hughes led to three runs on six hits and a walk with four strike outs.
