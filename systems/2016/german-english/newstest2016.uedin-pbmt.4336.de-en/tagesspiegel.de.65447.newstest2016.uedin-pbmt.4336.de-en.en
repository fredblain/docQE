JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square metre cell are degrading
The Federal Constitutional Court has an ex-prisoner which role he can fairly given that for months in a small cell was housed.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation, if they are housed in small cells.
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision released on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the parties can even hope to get money, if they were locked up for a few days in tight spaces (Az.: 1 BvR 1127 / 14).
It was an ex-prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was in the prison hospital Berlin-Tegel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space housed; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man who, according to his lawyer now been released, had been transferred to a larger cell.
His liability lawsuit because of the substandard conditions of detention against the country failed in Berlin.
But the constitutional judges waived the judgment of the Court of Berlin and had the case back for further examination.
You can see the dignity of the man.
Now the supreme court decides on the amount of compensation
Even if only for a few days in prison days are compensation for legal reasons from the period in question was relevant, given a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise, its decline is a legal protection of personality "would be to fear."
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation.
The constitutional judges have strengthened in the past often the rights of prisoners.
So they spoke only in April a detainee compensation because he was locked naked in a cell.
Degrading the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is, according to a decision by 2011.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday, the German Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009, a decent accommodation.
The plaintiff was placed on three months between 15 to 21 hours in the same type of cell, such as in the case of Karlsruhe.
The Berlin prisons had come in recent weeks due to a lack of personnel in the headlines.
Prisoners are locked up for 23 hours, again and again, the increasing aggressiveness, even with beatings, it should be because of the tense situation.
According to the press office of Justice 21 posts in Tegel are not due to defect, 19, 2016 will be lost.
