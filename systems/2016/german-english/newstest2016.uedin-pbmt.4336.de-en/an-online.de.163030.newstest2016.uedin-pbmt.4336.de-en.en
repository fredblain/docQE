Eleven years ago a sceptic on stage in Cologne Prime Club (now sits: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart, the shy looking folk singers of the US state of Michigan has recorded with felt-tip pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Stevens.
He told through various places that he always einzeichnet back on the map, which will report its meticulously and delicately arranged songs.
Where they are and how it looks there, in his home country.
Since then, Stevens turns out to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings From Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can harmoniously very close to American folk of the late sixties snuggle, but opulent always drifting into the great seem wise.
There is a rumour, "Michigan" would be the first part of a series of audacious: Each of the 50 US states should be sung in a row.
But as early as 2004 and is already published "Seven Swans" and breaks some positive expectations.
Reduced Stevens occurs here.

A year later, the New-York-based musician back to the series.
"Illinois" ("a sceptic Invites You To: Come on Feel the Illinoise") in 2005, is a universally-celebrated masterpiece.

Although now nearly 2,000 guests sit glued to their chairs, which has become a much more mature Stevens returns to the intimacy and the folk.
Without a word to say to the audience, a group of excellent musicians is enriched by the album.
We hear from the audience: The lecture was "opulent" and thus you can basically throw away the "plate."
It was only thanks to an encore Stevens modest plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bowed its head to a barrage of applause.
