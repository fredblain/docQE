The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood, he is the perfect man - but who is going to choose?
Secret revealed?...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly apparently who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, in which Sam Wood from The Bachelor finally lands, was shrouded in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not disclose whether she is the one that has received the final rose.
But when we with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski or Lana Jeavons-Fellows in the day before from three to two, eincheckten, you may have inadvertently given an indication of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have ruminated on lyrical way about why Wood is the perfect man, and his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should be given Woods last Rose?" Their answers could be the spoiler who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had from day one, a simple relationship with each other.
"From the moment when I went into the house and (Sarah) and Sam's sources said, because I felt that they were very compatible, and I have thought throughout the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah is with both feet on the ground, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I have seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited.
In their view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear that Wood "A" could be.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now fully focused on him," she said.
And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if they don't, because it was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls - it is a draw between Lana and Snezana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 7: 30 p.m., on Ten.
