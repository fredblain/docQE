Experts stress that it was at this time in 2011 by Rick Perry's leadership to the rising Herman Cain, none of which also won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.

Republican voters get used to the idea.
If they put their scholars hats, Republican voters think Trump is for real.
