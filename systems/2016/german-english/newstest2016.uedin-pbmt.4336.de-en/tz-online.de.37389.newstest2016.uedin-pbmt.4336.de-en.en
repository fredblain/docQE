Xavi: Pep Guardiola 2008 prevented changes to the FC Bayern
World and European champion Xavi plays since summer 2015 for the al-checkpoint guards sports club in Qatar
The FC Bayern was evident a few years ago, shortly before the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona.
Eight-time Spanish champion, three-time Cup winner, four-time Champions League winner, two-time club champion, two-time European champion, a world champion - the title list of Xavi is breathtaking.
In summer, the now 35-year-old left after 24 years with the FC Barcelona and moved to al-checkpoint guards sports club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca Xavi now reveals that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"They told me that Barça wants to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at that time, we have nothing," he says.
And the FC Bayern registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"I wanted to have support."
Reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi was not
The change came about but not.
And the key man for now works for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça Guardiola has taken under contract and I played a great Championship."
"PEP has told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me."
"He has got me."
Who knows how the season would have gone with Xavi in 2008 / 2009.
Xavi was for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern over the entire distance on the grass, turned the Red (4: 0, 1: 1) and celebrated at the end of the king class triumph.
