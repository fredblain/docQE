The Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack must be Goal.com
Wenger told Goal.com stressed that it was only September, and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario means that Goal.com will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship will still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that the Goal.com had finished last season strongly after a separate ankle injury and then was back to his old swing found during the early season.
This kind of "threat of injury is not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that has not healed well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not linked to his ankles, or with the injury he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but also, as Wenger acknowledged, there is the risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also developed an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation of Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases from Goal.com recorded since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of arsenal 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08, one of the two Premier League clubs, who have had the most injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and gain power struggle," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and go through a career of the sort that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players who need to get a little breather," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unrivalled, even after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, with 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal, the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco has taken and will continue to be driven by the distant hope, with his management of the club to its first UEFA Champions League triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close, but on the other hand, I am long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
