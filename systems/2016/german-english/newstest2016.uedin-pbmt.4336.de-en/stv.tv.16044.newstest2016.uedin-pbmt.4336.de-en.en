Stevan Hogg telephone used by girls to attract paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl as this slept loggte itself into an online messaging service, a number of which he received dishonest images of children who had been sent by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
You saw it, found the confusing messages and alarmed her mother immediately.
The police took it and saw the five images, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "relevant" web searches, the terms of the search for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officers that he had done it, because it would lead to "paedophiles on the Internet" and then "pretending to be a policeman, to frighten them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scare people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer from him, but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos.
He said that he did it to attract them.
He said he was sick in the head when he drinks, and said that he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
MS Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and weeping.
They also saw the indecent images on the phone and then confronted the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendants used computer and Playstation to talk to girls, who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty on the indictment to have included indecent images of children on June 14, last year, on the 25th of January this year, against the rules, and not to have appeared in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg did not appear in the register of sexual offenders, because one could argue that "no significant sexual element" in his crime was to be found.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred the verdict until October in order to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept for hearings on other outstanding cases in custody.
He was taken before the date of the judgment in the register of sexual offenders.
