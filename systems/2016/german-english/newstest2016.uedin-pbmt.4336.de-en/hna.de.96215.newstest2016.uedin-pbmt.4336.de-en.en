Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in the Franconian Eckental terraced houses for people who do not have a lot of money.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Wohnhraum need not only refugees, but also the single mother and the low earners."
"I show how you still can build cheap and good," says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees are pushing on the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: He builds in a project terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because the people here are to a large extent.
In view of the refugees, we also need enough housing in the next few decades.
A very facile, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs less space.
It facilitates the integration.
It is different when you are among the people who live in apartment buildings.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project, consists of three apartments, each for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What is the cost?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without a plot.
This is manageable.
Took six months of construction.
This is appropriate.
The building regulations have complicated their plans?
Gildner: Planning, I have learned through my project.
Particularly complicated there is always the looming sword of Damocles and expect the pitch regulation.
Creepy. "
It is still assumed that anyone who creates in a terraced house with three apartments, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities of the lack of space.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did the residents reacted to her terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who have accused me of creating luxury housing for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But you do not exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true that we have had in the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but built luxury apartments that can afford a little more.
My project has the message that the ordinary people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earners.
I show how you can still build cheap and good.
That is what it is.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystems technology in Regensburg and dealt with environmental analyses.
