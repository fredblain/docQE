Robot cars: Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany should be according to the will of the federal government to change the car a technological pioneer.
The federal cabinet on Wednesday approved a strategy paper from the house of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, investment in digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the IAA auto show of a "new era of mobility."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and provide less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants the issue with his counterparts from the G7 to discuss at the IAA will also meet with representatives of the industry.
The strategy of the Ministry of Transport, among other things, stressed the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
Testing new technology at a test track on the highway 9 is currently in Bavaria.
So no additional liability risks being saddled with the "driver," the federal government wants to review the legal framework "and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments."
So, for example, Germany wants to work internationally to ensure that the speed limit is raised for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km / h.
The federal government also wants to push for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only the people as a driver.
The automated driving the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver will be more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless cars on public roads "were not expected until well after 2020."
The added value in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany, the authors of the study estimate for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of the cars to improve safety and efficiency in road transport," said the SPD politician traffic SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in case of accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver but clearly needs to be clarified.
The Germans, however, self-driving cars are sceptical - much more than the French or Americans.
On Wednesday one of the AA's poll by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the inspection organization Dekra has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars over the next ten years will prevail, only 32 percent expected in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in them.
In France, 21 percent of respondents anticipate that by 2025, with autonomous driving cars, 33% in the US.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey of the digital association Bitkom only seven percent would agree to cede control over the whole driving on all roads.
On the highway, it could present in flowing traffic as much as 15 percent to 45 percent in a traffic jam.
Well, one in four would car control under any circumstances.
