This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, as bond yields will rise, and the economy is sliding into a recession.
What we know.
What we do not know how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process.
A recession came in just 11 months after the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial system.
Therefore, representatives of the US central bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather on the period which is needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants could see that all the fuss was exaggerated, perhaps because of a rate increase.
"The Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of" cheap money, "Julian Jessop, economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a low level, the seismic shock that many seem to fear to lead.
This does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here's a look based on historical trends, as some sectors of the economy might react:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of rate hikes could make things volatile for a while.
Once it arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for asset returns of 12 to 24 months after the first increase will be undermined, perhaps again reflecting the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happened after the Fed's interest-rate increases.
More specifically, the market is mostly over the last 35 years in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike, pretty flat over the next 250 days (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average rate of return over the past six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle, and thus increase the yield begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they often promote interest rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions, which did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
Most remarkable is that GDP is near its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank's nominal GDP stood at 118 rate hikes only twice since 1950 under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 per cent, only a few, and we expect that this will continue in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed just 1.5 percent.
Interest rate increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants throughout the year on a rate hike by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee addressed this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC increased could approve during this session, the futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all have cycles increase from 1950 to today in a super-cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre-recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade provided," according to the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting since the end of the last recession, the record was 35 months, and there have been 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, because the market is anticipating a rate hike, and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks if the change their strategic direction.
With bond yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing bond yields fall, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause bond yields between longer and shorter closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yielding bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting that Jones believes that the markets are already in Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has changed," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened its strategy.
By and large, companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US, will benefit if interest rates rise and local products are more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as well as the financing of their debt.
"History shows that" quality "stocks tend, three months after an initial rate hike to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets have surpassed companies with weak balance sheets after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality (by an average of 4 percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games consumers also will benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts are divided on how soon that will happen.
