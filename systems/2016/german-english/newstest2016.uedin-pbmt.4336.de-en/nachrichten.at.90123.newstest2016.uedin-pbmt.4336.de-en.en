Seehofer said: "Borders are not sealed off"
In a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) Provincial Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) dint on Monday further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders not be sealed off.
The journey of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible.
However, there is now doing precisely the appropriate controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being, there will be no more.
The protection would be brought, however, with regular trains to Germany.
Of the other EU member states Pühringer once again called for more solidarity in the refugee issue.
Now that Austria introduces controls at its borders again, for Pühringer is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
