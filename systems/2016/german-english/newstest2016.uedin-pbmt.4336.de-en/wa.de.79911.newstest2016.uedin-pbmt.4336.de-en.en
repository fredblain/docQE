Hammer artists spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with a crown of thorns (gold) is one of the main works, Otmar Alt has painted for his Bible.
Klaus old post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not in the Otmar-Alt-Bible, now with splendid images appeared.
In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has put in 150 designs his own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with bright colors and fanciful shapes, the 75-year-old - but what is not synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary, in line with the relevant issues, which may seem pretty bleak.
Roughly three years, Otmar Alt worked on his Bible Project, for which he has a subjective artistic choice from the many areas of the "Book of Books".
Born cycles that address issues such as crossroads, plagues, bids or Our Father.
So has he spontaneously several partners fascinated: This applies to the Luther-publisher with his theological orientation, as well as for the Kettler-Verlag, with its focus on art books.
And since the author Klaus old post office, who has worked on the basis of the painting with the relevant biblical passages is especially.
He has interpreted the Bible chosen by Otmar Alt, and so to the present day, in the current context "translated."
These texts are like verbal mirror of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote from Martin Luther and a set of the artist, his own personal thoughts on the situation.
The jewellery cover has golden letters.
This allows the 75-year-old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were the trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict Protestant doctrine-Order.
"As the education was" already with the cane, Otmar Alt remembers.
"I tried to come to terms with it, to stand by me, perhaps with the father."
His second concern was to help the arts in faster time to value: "The perception of visual worlds today is dominated by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is out there.
Artists have a different pleasure and joy to show things.
Pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer into the images "fall" are allowed to work, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture is looking for his counterpart."
Klaus post confessed on Tuesday during the presentation of the Otmar Alt-Bible-in-Otmar Alt-Foundation, "has always been a lover of Otmar Alts art was to be:" I like how he sees life with his images. "
Old did not care to fully understand the Bible, but the key for him, even mysterious issues.
"This was no cooperation on an equal footing," the post says: "This is about the images, the text merely explained." It was a Bible.
For Hans Möhler from Luther-publishing this book is an invitation to "deepen his life and find freedom."
Otmar Alts images speak for Möhler (biblical) both the language of love and responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition, on 15 November in the Otmar Alt-Foundation will be opened.
