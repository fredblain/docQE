Jarryd Hayne had several options in order to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there are many other teams that sent after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers have Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench, when he was a free-for-all as lost, as the Aussie rugby league convert on his first punt return on Tuesday during a 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula gave Hayne trusted his man and the next opportunity for a punt return and also in the running game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula also showed his true colors in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of trying to grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged it.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne on special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey was encouraged, advised him that his botched fishing and forgetting about the next game.
