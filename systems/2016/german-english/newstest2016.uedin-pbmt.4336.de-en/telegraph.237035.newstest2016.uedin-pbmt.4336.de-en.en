Friends: The comedy show that serious lessons about male friendships granted
The lack of similar images in the show is obvious, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up, now more desperate than ever, as suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - Campaign announced against a pathetic life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to challenge the culture in question, the men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to meet this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the suffering a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "healthy" mood, had doubled his chances of recovery are.
For those who are not depressed, cut a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems.
But, of course, you have to have friends, a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communications, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives are lively, strong, and to be successful, doubled, even if, in fact, dominated the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, reputation, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health is much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently declared that money really can't buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus has been turned upside down.
Each character has been defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was notable for the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers frequent hugs, moments when football peering into comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross, Rachel, all of which came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case, even if they are often reluctant to fully explore their feelings.
As an employee of the telecommunications ministry told me:... "my audience role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide, has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.
The old saying "I get it" has a huge impact, as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about issues openly. "
Friends of one of the shows that comes to my mind is when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
You clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
So my objective outsider status over the phone to people in moments of despair, may also contribute to the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend, Comedy Central friends decided to celebrate the day with the completely redesigned backdrop, why don't you take your friends for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you are sitting around in Starbucks alone someone see you give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
