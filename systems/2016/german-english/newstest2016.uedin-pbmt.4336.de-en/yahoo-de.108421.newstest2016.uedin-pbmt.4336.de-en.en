EU wants to limit mercury in carnivorous fish double
The European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large predators and consumers expect a significantly higher dose of nerves gifts.
The consumer organisation Food Watch, submitted a working paper of the European Union, sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects of misguided industrial and environmental policies with full force passed on pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt of the Watch.
Wolf Schmidt, the limits of the nerve poison should be increased for large fish at the end of the food chain such as swordfish Hai- or for "economic reasons" from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predators are already burdened with so much mercury that approximately 50 percent of the catches should be based on the current limits have not yet sold.
After doubling the limit then only 14.5% would be unsaleable.
In return, the EU wants to tighten this easing in food Watch the limits on other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams of 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described it as a "trick" because smaller Fried fish, such as carp are usually charged so low that they already comply with the proposed limits.
The reduction of small fish is therefore a perfides diversionary tactic that helps the economy alone, "said Wolf Schmidt.
Mercury is highly toxic to humans, a heavy metal that accumulates in the food chain, especially in carnivorous fish.
Therefore, the federal government warns that "even small amounts can cause great damage to the nervous system in the unborn."
The Federal Ministry for the Environment said on its website in relation to the current levels, but that a "health risk to the general population" is not expected.
Mercury mainly by the burning of coal in the environment.
The German coal-fired power plants to meet a written information of the German Federal Ministry for Environment at the Green members Anna Lena Baer wanted more than six tonnes of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total issued in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Danube was "permanently and all the" mirror "in March exceeded" from the paper, was quoted as saying.
In the past year were Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish is already among the most common reported health risks in the EU alert system RASFF.
