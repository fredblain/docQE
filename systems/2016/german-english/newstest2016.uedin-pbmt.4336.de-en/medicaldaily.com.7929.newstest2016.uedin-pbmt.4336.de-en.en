Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy nutrition for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Pediatric organisation SPRS is trying, in a shocking way to educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, it does so with the presentation of pictures of babies who suck on breasts that are painted with images of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements will be pregnant women and young mothers, their daily caloric intake by about 500 calories per day.
But new research suggests that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adjustment that should make mothers.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and it protects against the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
