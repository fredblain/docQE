IOS 9: How do you get the new iPhone operating system, when Apple released update
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tap on "General" and then "Software Update."
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some are after the installation on problems encountered when they receive an error message that says that the "software update failed."
To get around this problem, users are encouraged to wait either, dates back to the rush or to try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself guides you through the rest of the process.
This could potentially mean deleting apps to create space - but Apple has made it through the streamlining of the updates less likely, and it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re-install it once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade, or is located near a battery charger, so that the battery is loaded.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not mean that the update will continue, because the phone could possibly halfway switched off and lead to a breakdown of the updates.
