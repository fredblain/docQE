The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The major overhaul of the "New" shipyard in Linz industry line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of office and production building is the Stock Exchange listed IT group S & T, the rest (2,700 square meters) of young, innovative companies in the technology sector are rented.
"In the IT are the wise heads our raw material - and we have to try to make it work for us," says S & T CEO Hannes Lower Hauser.
He could imagine, in start-up companies to invest in the new shipyard and later what to acquire.
From the outset, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - which houses down some promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested in S & T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which is one-third of the city of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Federal (FFG clubs).
The building is leased by the Linz AG for 60 years of S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of space in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent, there are questions.
