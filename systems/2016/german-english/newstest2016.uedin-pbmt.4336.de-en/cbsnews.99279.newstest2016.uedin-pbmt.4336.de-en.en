Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closing the border, refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and riegelte from the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and stuck all who tried to come into the country illegally, all with the aim to stop the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border, as hundreds of migrants have refrained in a no man's land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land along the road between the two checkpoints and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations grew.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted "open the borders!" And screaming insults against the Hungarian riot police.
Some had food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister, said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary were returned, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.

The turmoil at the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc at a contentious meeting in Brussels to agree on a common immigration policy.
However, the ministers agreed that the responsibility for 40,000 people to share the überrumpelten in Italy and Greece had taken refuge, they expressed their hope that finally, next month, or until the end of the year, an agreement was reached that EU states further 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary, would resume.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special summit of the European Union, to discuss the immigration crisis on the continent.
Hungary, however, was not his hopes for a speedy action from Brussels or from its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they were able to seal off roads and speeding up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also planned to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence along the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prison inmates in the race, the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, have been used.
In recent months, many war refugees in Hungary from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the entry point into the European Union.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that most of the economic refugees are arriving in search of a better life and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view very much at odds with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, making the crossing the border or the Beschädigen of the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence which the government along the southern border with Serbia was build to a crime. These laws also give higher sentences for convicted traffickers.
"Because of the situation caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declared the Notzustand," said government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Procedurally, the parliament must still approve the deployment of the military, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters saw heavily armed soldiers at the border with vehicles and dogs for days already.
Gyorgy Bakondi, national-security adviser to Orban, said that 45 people authorities while trying to cross the border caught, 15 others were already penetrated deep into the country.
You come across as they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and the committing of crimes are accused under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia after a Zugwaggon arrived with barbed wire to close the borders.
Confusion surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians a small office opened in a metal container, in order to process the data from people and a crowd of people pressed to hineinzudrängen there.
