The BBC should give up Eastenders, former head of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop programmes such as Eastenders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used in order to make the kind of programmes that are not by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public service programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in solid window against the most popular shows of its rivals and placing of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said that the company in partnership with other organisations to do, Johnson said that he was six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried, without success, to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have a problem with the idea that the BBC has commissioned programmes or broadcasts which are clearly non-subsidized rivals would be shown," said Johnson, the House of Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the licence fee, which I consider medium- or long-term is not a good idea, you should at least give its production programs that others do not.
Send The Voice in a prime-time window because they want to reach the broadest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show, this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is of course nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax funded programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is such a programme, Eastenders is another, admittedly, both in-house productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series of Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular programmes are what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows such as Eastenders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public-service niche programmes to BBC4 "should go where you can measure the audience not quite, but they do their job, and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcasting fees go," Well, of course, we have all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
You put them in a time window in which nobody ever wanted to see them.
The broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value.
Of course, you all think we all think that for £150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who are £150 is a lot of money, whether that is true wonder, because they don't consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to inform, educate and entertain. "
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now officially classified as education - he said that 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and it should be on the public television channels in Australia and Canada are an example of this change to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the issue of partnerships Elstein, the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, he said that only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial channels said to make everything available online.
