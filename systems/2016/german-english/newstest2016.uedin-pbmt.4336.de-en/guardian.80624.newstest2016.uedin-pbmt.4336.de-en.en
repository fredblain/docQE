"Sono Genetics' may control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by explosions of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction at the moment in which they are irradiated with sound pulses that the threshold of human hearing at high frequencies in order to be heard.
The impetus to work through the involvement of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called sono Genetics, where ultrasound can be used to create a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure will one day replace the deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found that the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures, the TRP-4 called ion channels in the membranes of cells, some of the worms are found.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.
By ultrasound-controlled nematodes to create genetically modified Chalasani, the worms so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels.
If he uses ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are reinforced by the micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists to neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that sono Genetics may have some advantages over this technology.
Unlike light in an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain needs to be sent down to low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through unimpeded and tissue in the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible that the human neurons were temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments to make," said Chalasani.
Other applications could be on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
