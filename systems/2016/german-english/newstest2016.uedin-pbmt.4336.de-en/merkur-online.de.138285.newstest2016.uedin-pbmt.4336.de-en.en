Exceptions to the new Bern Rieder sports
The council approved the Bern Ried Bauantrag for 2.3 million expensive gym.
And he made an exception.
The roof for the solar system may be flat.
Plans for the long-awaited turn buildings at the Bern Rieder sports grounds are progressing step by step: In a recent City Council meeting, the finalised Bauantrag was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the board had decided, among other things, a request for a project "exception" or "liberation" from the current construction plan.
In the "exception" was about the permission for a special form of roof construction.
So should a saddle roof with non-concentric First and roof over state "will be built.
Background of the planned use of the roof space for solar panels: "We get together a wonderfully great southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger said in the meeting.
In the "liberation," it went to the roof, which will be mandatory for energy reasons - other than the construction plan - under ten degrees.
The volume of the hall will be considerably reduced.
Therefore, a "liberation" was necessary because the development plan allows for the roof no "exceptions" - whereby the Bern Rieder council usually proceeds with exemption applications rather restrictive.
The physical structures, however, this is not a recurring project: "We are creating a precedent," said Steinberger.
The buildings at the centre is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Ried Bern.
Cost of around EUR 2.3 million are factored in.
Grants are expected from the school and sports promotion.
The next procedural step 18 x 36 metres wide hall Bauantrag for now will be presented to the local Health Authority for consideration.
