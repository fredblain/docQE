Eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
Eleven years ago I moved and even forgotten 19-year-old into student housing, still in the faith of Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the strained smile of those I've annoyed - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
In the student residences ranging from slightly nerve-wracking up to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to chat about: People, where you are coming from, and where you've taken sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you Marmite "frankly neither love nor hate, because seriously guys, it's only a yeast extract hahaha, I'm in my room.
You breathe through.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It steers the conversation and helps you to find the people you would like as opposed to those with whom you do not speak, even if your eyelashes were caught on fire and the fire extinguisher.
Let people.
The rooms of people turning into drink-receptions, movie-night venues and local venues, but they are also the places where people dress up and her underwear back.

Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a haven, but many student residences form a room-to-room-stroll-culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life-long friendship.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship to go on, but you have to leave so that I get back the energy that I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when the marshals is weary of sociability - and you will send an SMS knocking him.
Speaking of knock on the door: Do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a locked door was not an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since the university at the height of the Back-mania, is the knock on the doors of people with a plate of brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've baked you something. And now, please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Homemade offer is a good way to strike up new friendships.
Her housemates feel obliged to talk and perhaps eventually will associate your face with a tasty morsel.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Badly mixed clumps of flour, sugar and fat cause people are sleeping, if you knock on the door.
To steal food, is a common crime in student residence halls.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but it is the Milchs take a drop in your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it more balanced than my resident who added their milk a detergent to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise, dissuading people from sleeping or at work.
It is not just a matter of being a decent human being, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb about the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl in my hall asked her neighbour to ask whether it makes them something a little quieter drum & bass, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
They responded with even more loud music.
When they finally stop at 5 p.m., they let their neighbours kindly sleep two hours before they had their own music blaring, their door graduated and embarked on their three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic, if your future spouse would randomly collected in the same student housing?
Conversely, it would be deeply embarrassed if you keep your future as a resident assistant, a special feature to separate them, and then they have to see every day, and maybe see how it moves across all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way, but if a resident assistant is definitely not your future, try at least to persuade your body a little common sense.
Leave In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has not verschlossenem his keys in his room, the line between having fun appealed and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments until he becomes a boomerang.
Submit by hiding a valuable lesson about safety and amusing - but you never to flood someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
You are closing their doors, and put the key in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but you see tackern their possessions on the ceiling not more than twice.
