Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the president of the Association of Tennis Australia, Steve Healy praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo that is repeatedly referred to as the "Special Ks," came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the spotlight.
In a fiery qualification game in Cincinnati soon after his opponent had Kokkinakis and Ryan Harrison twice to be separated by the referee, with Harrison stated: "Kyrgios beat Wawrinka would have to, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he smashed a tennis racquet after a spasm of a potential US Open victory in Group of thwarted, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind an artist's Bernard in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"One thing that I'm quite ereifere is the fact that, in my view, Thanasi was embroiled in the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he Krampfes due to a lost in the US Open, but he is not the first player to make a racket out of frustration with himself has broken, Thanasi and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of.
But, really, he was in the US Open have behaved extremely well, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around, he has a great family around, and I think he was treated a bit too strict.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works extremely hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never been a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trained hard, he is in good form, he is a very stable and mature young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy also supported the decision to take Kyrgios at the important precedent, which starts on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as an integral part of a long-term return to the team. "
"First of all, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversy around [Kyrgios], Healy said.
And I think that Nick has managed to rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to explain to him the consequences of his actions, and some time out of the spotlight, in which he can only think about it, I think, is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best for him.
