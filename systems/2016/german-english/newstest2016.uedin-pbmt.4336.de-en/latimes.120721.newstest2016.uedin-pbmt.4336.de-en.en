The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent and effective on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which are collected in November.
The company said that it expect the result compared to the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenue and because of the growth in online trading will increase.
