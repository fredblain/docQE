Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered during the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven a double fracture of his right leg.
While this brought the left side defenders cry and it was ruled out for at least six months from the games, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area collapsed.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow, or perhaps a day later and then operates in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, then it is very difficult and great plays, and then this happens.
In the dressing room, he had an oxygen mask on.
He wept.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to escape a red card and the imposition of a Elfmeters.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, was not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very serious attack with both feet.
A tweet on Shaw's account was: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I come back stronger."

The England defender has with the European Championship in France an extra incentive to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious violation."
If a player leaves with this kind of violation of the place are all very sad.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg when Mexico against Van Gaals Holland team played in the World Cup in 2014.
"It is very difficult because it was not his intention to injure the opponent, and then when you hear that it is a very serious violation, it is not good," Cocu said.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see the ball, which was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he had touched him [Moreno], but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad. I am so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also brought to the hospital - after a foul play by Chris Smalling.
