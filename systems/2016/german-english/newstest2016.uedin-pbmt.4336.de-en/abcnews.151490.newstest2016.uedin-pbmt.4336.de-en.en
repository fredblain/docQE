Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that there are not so many Christmas seasonal employees as last year is set, but the toy and baby products retailer says that he's currently working on his staff and seasonal workers will be an opportunity to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, and at Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were employed.
Most of the jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that it will begin this month with job interviews and the number of employees rises from October to December.
While the holidays are still months away, the Christmas season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to provide stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
