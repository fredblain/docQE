Professional climbers and help Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete of the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and won the grand prize of $1 million home.
The competition show, which has just completed its seventh season, has never had a competitive participants experienced all the stages of his obstacle course was complete.
During the final season, the two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, until the finals.
The last task that was climbing on a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, and he was the first athlete to complete the arduous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. Caldiero, ended this challenge full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News $after the hard-won victory, still in shock over winning the Grand Prix of 1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or" to life, Isaac told E! About his pile of money.
So all of a sudden.. as I can not even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent weed, sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and gets why Britten, although he finished first in the course, not just any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalists it receives," the one with the fastest time to weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he gets a great bonus.
I do not think that he has any resentment about it.
He is just so happy to have done what he has done.
Mass of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I was to be beaten by someone, then I am glad that it was Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
