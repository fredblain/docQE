Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe is the wrong speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down at the beginning of the year by a panel of the staircase.
He was unhurt, but the video of the event quickly spread on social media.
The opening of Parliament has been marred by allegations of members of the opposition that they have received anonymous death threats and they were warned not to accompany the speech by Mr Mugabe with Buhrufen.
Last month, they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians SMS messages on their mobile phones have received the warning, Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message is coming from a number that is not shown, but she has the title of 'death', he told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the affected members of Parliament that the immunity ends in Parliament, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned" about the dangers to the politicians.
