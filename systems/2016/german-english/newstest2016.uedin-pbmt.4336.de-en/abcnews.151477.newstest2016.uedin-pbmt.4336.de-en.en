Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss, a handwritten note, scribbled on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to, I could make it back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, 300 miles already went to the school grounds, according to the police, a popular history professor Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office was shot and killed.

Recent changes in the employment of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard, for it does not guarantee an automatic path to a job as an assistant professor.
University President William upon said that he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, of course, but "there was something in Mr. Lambs idea."
These are questions that can no longer answer Lamb.
After fleeing the campus police later found Lambs when he could back into Mississippi from Arkansas.

"She was totally devastated," O 'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O 'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played guitar.
