Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut is expected at the Prime Minister's Question Time with
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to his debut at Prime Minister's Question Time, and for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will gather for the first of his six questions set out shortly after noon, with his performance of the media and probably the Labour MEPs will be examined closely.
He called for "less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he could skip some meetings to leave to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn's leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC's annual conference on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour leader, on Tuesday during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain to remain in silence, criticism from a number of Tory most recent provoked and is at the heart of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "stood in respectful silence" and he had acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith told BBC Two's Newsnight programme that he had advised the Labour leader, to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, and they rely on differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the Parliamentary party originally supported him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Charles says that political differences within Labour "pile up" after Mr Corbyn's comments on the position of the European Union and the reduction in profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour changes present to the whole idea of a limit to remove altogether.
Hours later, said Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions minister, that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government's plans, the cap of £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn is the fifth to be Labour leader, David Cameron, the Tory leader, in the last decade at the Dispatch Box in the House, is facing.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions for Mr Cameron, he has more than 30,000 comments were made.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will both repartee "and refrain from arguing with the barbs and has instead decided to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the shadow business minister, will represent him, if he does not take part - for example, if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He has also brought the idea into the conversation that other colleagues speak occasionally, and that he had contacted John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said that he is out of politics in the style of a "Ditherer-theatre" to remove, which is often associated with the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later, he admitted that he had failed it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister was seen as the main barometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons, and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature, and needs far-reaching reforms.
