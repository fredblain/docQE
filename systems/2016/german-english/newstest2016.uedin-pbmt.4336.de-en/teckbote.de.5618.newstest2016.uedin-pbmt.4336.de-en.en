Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging of "passion" the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of the circus arts.
The aim is to draw every age group under the spell of amazing acrobatics, animal dress and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites into the circus ring on the brick Hans√°g to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," Stephanie Probst, head teacher and junior leader says.
"Passion" - under this motto, the current Manegeninszenierung.
For more than 33 years, the circus is in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift to the delight of the family is in the blood.
"It is important to us, the people from their daily routine wegzuholen and for two hours in a completely different world to take," said the 27-year-old junior leader.
"Manegencocktail with cosmopolitan flair," says director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour this flair can now experience.
The programme of the circus with talented artists from all over the world.
Awards at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov clown Family draws the audience with wit and charm.
Also the Castillo brothers know their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films it wants to include the Cuban duo loose.
Lightness and agility - they identify with these words.
Their humorous art on the mast to conquer the hearts of women.
Except fascinated by many roars of laughter, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst with sensitivity and flexibility.
With the unicycle on a balance ball?
For He Yuan, no problem.
Snakes fascinate and scare people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated with its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals are part of our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst said.
Abuses in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also notes: "It is not good for our animals, it is also not good for us."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy any pranks canvas.
The "four-legged artists," as they are called, can be read as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
The animal is not feeling well, it is not in the circus ring.
So the top priority: Good care for the animals.
Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing has happened.
"But then, all of a sudden, our little Jumbo, was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is still not ready for the circus ring, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
So something for every visitor should be there.
"One thing is for sure," Stephanie Probst says: "Whether five or 1 200 spectators, we always do our best, with all my heart."
The Circus Probst invites from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 hours to his ideas.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is a day for the presentation at 5 p.m., the prices are reduced.
In addition, the show is open daily from 10: 00 to 18: 00.
