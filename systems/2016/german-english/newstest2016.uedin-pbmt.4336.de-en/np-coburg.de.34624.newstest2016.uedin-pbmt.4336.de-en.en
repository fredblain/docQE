The Free voters demand due to the high numbers of refugees, the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Party and group chief Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-autumn exam in Great Wall city facing a severe crisis in the schools, if not for the many new students according to new teachers: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers for the schools before the collapse to preserve," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise we will have distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Land of the Free group meets voters until Friday in the Lower Franconian municipality.
Actually quite different topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free meeting voters.
"Of course, the issue of asylum is" the closing of camps, Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the creation of UN safe havens for refugees in Syria, as they had during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"So it is not, we must deal with the causes," said the head of liberal voters.
Want to deport rejected asylum seekers outside the voters as quickly as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-chief criticized that several states are not consistent: "We need uniform standards across the provinces."
"Bayern deport, others not.
"We need to be able to act."
But the land policy in large Wall city should not fall under the table.
A long-standing remains on the agenda: The education policy.
As the new school year, Culture Minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched a pilot in 47 schools "intermediate plus" in which an extension to provide intermediate is tested by three to four years, as a result, it takes nine years to return to the school.
But the Aiwanger does not go far enough.
"The issue of G9 must be accelerated," said the FW-boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all schools that want it.
Free rides on the G9 wherever it is desired.
