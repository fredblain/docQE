4 people killed after police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police rubber bullets fired into a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted on Tuesday evening in Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, Chief District official, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
MR Dhakal said that the police had used tear gas and fired into the air before they grip on rubber bullets.
20 police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the use of rubber bullets is known by those that they can kill, but they are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The confrontation was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces that are formed in the context of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus, who want a state of their own.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were in violent clashes since the 10th
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but it is a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been ruled for centuries.
Work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April.
The lawmakers voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said that the new constitution would come into force on Sunday.
