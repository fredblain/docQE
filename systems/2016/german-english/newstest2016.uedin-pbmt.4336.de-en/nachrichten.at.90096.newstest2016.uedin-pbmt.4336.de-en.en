Now that Viktor Orbán sends many thousands more to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the camp at Röszke on the establishment of structures that ensure humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly brought up the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism.
Victim of this policy not only those Austrians, who are now faced with chaos in the border areas.
The countryside will have to conclude that the "promised land" that she has invited and welcomed, is nothing more than another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flow of refugees and of winter to make us humane conditions for asylum seekers.
And it will be an even bigger - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
