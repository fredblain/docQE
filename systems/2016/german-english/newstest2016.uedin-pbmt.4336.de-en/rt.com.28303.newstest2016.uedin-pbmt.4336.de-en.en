"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called the violence in the home countries of the refugees to end.
The Dalai Lama said the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for through in Oxford, which is devoted to ethics studies.
He claimed that the interests of humanity under the circumstances should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of the Western European countries on the refugee crisis is admirable, but the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible that anyone can come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany's and Austria's efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To care for several thousand refugees, is wonderful, but in the meantime, you need to think about long-term solutions, like a real peace and real development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries can be created," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama has addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack on 11 September, it became clear that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of uncontrollable events.
After September 11, I have expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know that his motives were good, but he used violence, and this has led to unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
