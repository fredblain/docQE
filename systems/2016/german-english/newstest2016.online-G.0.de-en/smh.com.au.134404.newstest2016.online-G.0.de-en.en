Serbier $ 200,000 bail after drug charges
A man may be a life-long penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine that were smuggled into Queensland, was released on bail of $ 200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month, after the Federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Solay, who came from South America, Vanuatu, and in August in Coomera docked.
Maksimovic was observed, how he met his co-defendants in the Marina during the Morning and later in the cafe Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
In spite of a possible a life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, argued the lawyer of Maksimovic, that there is no evidence that he tried to have the entire amount, and that in the cafe of a harmless reason could be.
The judges of the Supreme court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the flight risk Maksimovic.
He has clear relations to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he had lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovics mother and stepfather had offered a bail of $ 200,000 as a security together in order to achieve his release.
"After reading the affidavits of two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden," said judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not appear to be enough to keep him from, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, under the conditions that he give up his Australian and his Serbian passport at the police daily reports, and a curfew from 18:00-06:00.
