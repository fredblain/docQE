On their most anticipated meeting in years of the Federal Reserve to spend strategists for two days this week, around a 27-foot Honduran-mahogany table in the sitting position, in order to decide whether it is time, for the first Time in nearly a decade, raise the key interest rate.
Looming menacingly over them at one end of the ornate, two-storey meeting hall, there is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that the Fed should set Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues on the economic interests of the Nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from the Congress: maximize U.S. employment, and prices here are stable.
But since the great recession, the Fed's leaders have recognised that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too tight to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start, to be of the unprecedented stimulus by the near Zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008 weaned.
Although most of the data of the economy show that it is growing solidly, could make the recent turmoil in the global financial markets, the already cautious Fed representatives anxious to add to this volatility by raising the interest rate for Federal loans - and it was also only a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and Inflation will be in the first line the most important thing you observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.
"But I think, if you were not looking for a pretext to increase the interest rate, is the increased uncertainty around the global market, enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what will the Fed do, what is insecure in themselves the financial market.
About half of the Economists surveyed recently by Bloomberg, have said a rate increase this week before.
The financial markets expect a Wait for the Fed, a key indicator, which indicates only a 30% Chance of an increase.
This suggests a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial jumped in average value to 228,89 points, or 1.4 %, to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy keeps the set in this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a Surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time," he said.
If you do it, "she would have to go in your statement, very far, to calm the financial markets in order to panic."
Other experts argued that a rate hike would calm the financial markets, because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed to be well on the way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer, that you expect this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be required, an increase in the rate.
Although job creation slowed in August, was the improvement on the labour market in this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level that the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of a recovery.
And although Inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, said the Fed representatives that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower Oil prices.
The "economy can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world flashed at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell in may by more than 16 % below its peak, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow the global growth.
The market has recovered a little this month, the Dow is now up almost 10% below the High in may.
For the Fed-representative of the market turbulence affecting the complex calculation, when should the interest rates increase.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news would not be about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last couple of weeks, you would attract in this session, take the reins," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Central Bank.
Now he predicts that you will at least have to wait a month to get the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data, describing the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concern of the Fed, therefore, it should not be technically involved in their decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed is a monetary authority in the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere note of the former head of Ben S. Bernanke in the year 2013, that the Fed could its monetary Expansion "narrow", and caused confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can not be expected from the Fed representatives that you simply monitor developments elsewhere, but also with other Central banks, and experts advise you to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is more art than science, "" said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the management of the assets of the company Envestnet, Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of over-reaction to financial market movements, which are not associated, apparently, with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, de is committed to an increase in interest rates, the quoted decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia brought the Fed to lower its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings", in spite of limited discernible impact on growth in the United States," said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives made these cuts.
The Fed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the Market meltdown in 2008 in the first place, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for interest rate setting by the Bank of England.
The recent turbulence will not come close to this level, he said.
"You don't want to certainly get to a Situation in which you fear a rate rise, because the markets get upset," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not to mention the financial stability, and until that is changed, I don't think you should rush ahead of the time.
