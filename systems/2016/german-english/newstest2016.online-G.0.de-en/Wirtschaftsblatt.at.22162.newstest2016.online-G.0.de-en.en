Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
At the meeting, it is the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed Two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is strained after years.
Washington criticized the ongoing settlement building by Israel and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of willingness in the peace process.
The Obama advertised Deal to the Iranian nuclear program has worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had held, at the invitation of the Republicans in the US Congress a controversial speech, which was partly seen as an Affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a Meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel.
