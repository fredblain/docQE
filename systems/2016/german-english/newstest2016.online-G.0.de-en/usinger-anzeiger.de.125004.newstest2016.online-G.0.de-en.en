Space probe Cassini finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice crust of the Saturnmonds Enceladus, a global ocean spills.
The researchers from observations of the spacecraft "Cassini".
Therefore, the moon wobbles slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
This wobbling motion is only small, but still too large for a consistently solid celestial body, according to an announcement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US-state of New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus".
Quite some time it was known that it must be under the ice of Enceladus liquid water.
So Cassini had "discovered" already in 2006, Eisvulkane at the South pole of the Saturnmonds, the water vapor and ice Particles spew and the so-called E-Ring of Saturn feed.
At least at the South pole there must be an underground sea, joined by the astronomers at that time.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, was not clarified.
