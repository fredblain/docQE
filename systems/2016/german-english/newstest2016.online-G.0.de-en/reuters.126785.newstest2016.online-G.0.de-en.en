For slightly obese diabetics weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 Diabetes can take according to a new study a minimum of five years.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people live with Diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data require a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial to the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to shrink to the size of the stomach.
They reduce Hunger and the body to limit its own ability to take in food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 have proven to be Diabetes as efficiently, but most of the studies were conducted in people, the morbidly obese with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.

For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital the data that you have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 Diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this Operation, declined from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained in those, the non-surgical Diabetes treatments received approximately the same at 29.
Among those who underwent a surgical procedure, dissolved in 36 % of the Diabetes disease completely, and 28 % partially.
In the medically-treated group disbanded in comparison, the Diabetes is complete only in the case of a percent, and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results were at the controls of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL-cholesterol ", in General, better in the 'surgical' group," found the authors.
The researchers monitored the patients ' blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - not decreased as reflected in the improvement in hemoglobin A1c level - the mortality rate in five years, according to the lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year of the Bypass surgery group had lost compared to the gastrectomy group, more weight (to 18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved larger decreases in BMI (7,4 against 5.1) and haemoglobin A1c (3,1 % vs. 2.1 %) and experienced more of a complete Overcoming of the Diabetes (46,9 % vs. 16.7 percent).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that Operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study was in obese people undergoing bariatric surgery to die is about 29 percent less likely to be in the course of 15 years, compared to a group, the more conventional methods tried.
Although the new study showed no advantage for the Survival in the surgery patients, said Blackstone, it should be reassuring for those with a BMI under 35, who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this Operation group is in this lower BMI-lower", without the increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their Doctors should start to take weight seriously, as soon as the Patient lies with his BMI of between 27 and 30.
"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once you have accumulated these genetic Changes, which have associated their body with obesity and Diabetes, is a reversal of really hard."
