Why I have to witness an execution in Oklahoma will be
A little later today, except in the case of a late legal Intervention, I can see how a man to death.
If it happens, and I hope it happens, I'm going to sit in a spectators gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at the time of his death.
The invitation was made already, for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day grew closer, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed, because I thought it would be a good opportunity to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery, to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Anyone who is selected, observe it without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossips a confined friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I can't be a witness and a Journalist, so it will not be allowed, a notebook and a pen with me to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the Details.
A Journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
They tell the story of the detainee, as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
You admitted that you "could have done better formulate", but she still thinks that it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a Problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He says to me, what I write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international Reporter is present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the Publicity of this movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please stop the series of Podcasts, which I have made.
I do not want to go back to all the Details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the fact.
But I think that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty of murder.
I certainly don't think there is enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters, to which you can apply.
What you will get from me, is what it means to see a man in an unnecessary death.
