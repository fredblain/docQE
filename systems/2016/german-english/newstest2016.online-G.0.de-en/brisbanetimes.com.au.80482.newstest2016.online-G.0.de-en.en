Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Association, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis earned more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and earned according to the President of the Australian tennis Association, Steve Healy more praise than criticism for its own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented Duo, will always be referred to as the "Special Ks", was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters into the limelight.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be twice separated by the referee, with Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen as he smashed a tennis racket after a spasm foiled a potential US Open victory with Richard Gasquet, was Kokkinakis of Healy staunchly defended.
The Teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against great Britain.
"One thing that I ereifere me pretty, is the fact that, according to my view, Thanasi a little in the dispute was dragged," said Healy.
He has broken a racket as he lost due to a spasm in the U.S. Open, but he is not the first player who has broken a racquet out of frustration with yourself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he is proud of it.
But, really, he behaved the same way in the US Open extremely well, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison, and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great Team around him, he has a great family around you, and I think he was treated a little too harsh.
He is a very Mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits in the Team and so on, he has never had a Problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker area, he trains hard, he is in good Form, he is a very stable and Mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be on its own merits evaluated.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the all-important preliminary, which begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra, as a long-term integral part of the Team to return."
"First of all, we hope that the Team is completely focused on competition and not on all the Controversy around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think that Nick has very quickly managed to the rise of what people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the Public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him the consequences of his actions understandable. Some time outside of the spotlight, he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the Best thing for him.
