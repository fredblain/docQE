Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were a lot of other Teams, sent to his impressive open training day at the end of last year's requests.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers have banned Hayne for the Rest of the game on the bench, as he lost a scramble as the Aussie Rugby League convert for his first Punt Return on Tuesday in the 20-3 victory against Minnesota in the act.
But Tomsula trusted his man, and Hayne was the next opportunity at a Punt Return and in the running game after an injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula is still showing his true face in the locker room after the game.
To grind instead of his Rookies before the Rest of the team by the mill, he encouraged you.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne also publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch, and to take care of the next game.

It is not the Start, of the Hayne, and its massive Australian followers for his NFL was certainly debut had hoped for.
Hayne left after the Fumble cursing the game field, and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1, that he could imagine a worse Start to his NFL career,
"That was a thing that occurs now, it only cares about the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne has compared the Schnitzer and his Origin debut back in 2007, as a Pass in his own in-Goal area, a Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27-Year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with Fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
