The BBC should EastEnders give up, says a former boss of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop to send programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals "would give their right Arm" for Hit Shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programmes that are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for you to place public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in hard controversial window of time against the most popular Shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years during his time at Channel 4, without success, to come up with the BBC in contact.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC are programs in order, or sends, which would also clearly shown of non-subsidised rivals," said Johnson in the house of lords communications Committee's inquiry on the future of the BBC.
If you don't want to keep the licence fee, which I think is in the medium or long term is a good idea, you should.its production, at least on programs that do not make others, or in order to give
Send The Voice in a first-class window of time, because you want to reach the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would, this show is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I can see why a regressive tax funded programs, which could also be without the subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is a further, admittedly, both productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right Arm for.
I'm trying to see how this is to be public-broadcasting.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a contractor for the series, the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 was head, said that the BBC is to blame for the hunting for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments to the most popular broadcasts of the BBC's what the former head of Sky, Tony Ball, who in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell Shows such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and you can argue, if you go to your hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion pounds of licence fee, "Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
Put it in a window of time in which nobody wanted to see ever.
The licence fee Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive System, in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think, we all think that you can get for £ 150 per year, here is a great value, but for people who is for the 150 £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 boss, David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian Mission "to inform, to educate and to entertain".
He said, only a little of the BBC production would now be classified officially as an education - he said that it had 1% of their TV-production and 0.1% in the Radio and you should take to the public television stations in Australia and Canada is an example of this change in "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only a handful of shown on television and with the commercial broadcasters form alliances, to make everything available online.
