Jewelry instead of a Curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it went to the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to make meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace created in large quantity for customers, which Cover, for example, and curtains that have been further processed.
This alone no longer works today, said Andreas Reinhardt, managing Director of the fashion tip in Plauen.
Instead, the Mode is again important.
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a larger role, and was then supplanted by the home textile industry and is now being discovered as a niche.
Reinhardt mentions a few examples: top in jewelry, accessories such as bags and in regional Costumes.
Even the so-called Vintage-fashion-inspired eras of past style the picture, this is a growing job potential.
Who operated in the textile industry in Germany, no niches, no longer on the market.
With us, you already make up half of all jobs.
Fashion tip member is Plauen, together with nine other companies in the industry Association Plauener lace and embroidery.
Only you are allowed to carry the protected Label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of the sales were broken.
Private specialist shops and also the wholesale trade it is almost.
Our products reach the customer in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays produced in Asia, much cheaper and almost exclusively on chains sold.
In addition, the Export schwächle, currently Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons, therefore, for new ways.
The industry Association is trying to score points through environmental awareness, such as Cordula Bauer of the stick pearl explains in Falkenstein: "Since this year we carry a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and in a socially responsible manner".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used".
Diplom designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger foreign office of West Saxon University of Zwickau - in the faculty of applied arts, and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
Of the competition from the Asian region to oppose something, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think, especially economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing Design will varies often only slightly, in order to keep a customer base.
Several years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historical snow ball top.
The machine embroiders in some Places, small beads.
The Plauener gold champion Bianca hall Bach wrought-Krauße was inspired by them: "Before, I could start with the traditional Plauener Spitze nothing".
Now, you used the snow-ball top for your jewelry.
In a complex process shaping the pattern in silver.
"A lot of people in the Region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also provides in the United States, Australia, and Finland - and especially to customers whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and want to have a piece of memorabilia.
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauener Spitze.
