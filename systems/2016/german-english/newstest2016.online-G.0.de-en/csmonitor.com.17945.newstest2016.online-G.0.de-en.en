That will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
A rate hike is coming, and the boom will falter, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is, how long will it take and how long it will last.
In particular, the story provides for economic low the instructions to the end.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in Raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial systems to respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US have stressed the Central Bank so violently that investors should focus on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period of time that is needed for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, market participants may find, however, that all the excitement was exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates may.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be used by some as a Signal for the end of the Era of "cheap money" interpreted," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights, but still on a low level, in order to lead to the seismic shock, the fear many seem to.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no impact.
Here's a historical trend-based view of it is likely to react to, as some sectors of the economy:
As the market has in the last month seen, can make the anticipation of interest rate increases in things for a while volatile.
As soon as the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency that income on the assets 12 to 24 months will be stalled after the first increase, perhaps reflecting again the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts happened in a recent study, which increases to interest rates by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is in the last 35 years, mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest rates fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 per cent), then back to the normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six past cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis, the Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the share tends to occur later in the hike cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in interest rates, they often promote.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with some of the conditions that existed before and which could hasten a recession.
Extremely noteworthy is that the gross domestic product will be in the vicinity of its lowest point in the case of an interest-rate increase by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank was one of the 118 interest rate, the nominal GDP increases since 1950, only twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, expect only a few that this will continue and expect for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed, only 1.5 percent.
Increases in interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this Time," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made throughout the year on an interest-rate increase by the Fed in focus, and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and Economists believe that the FOMC could authorize an increase in this session, the Futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all of the increase in cycles from 1950 to today, in a Super-cycle took place with increasing momentum in GDP and in Front of-recession highs very soon after the beginning of the recovery in the shadow," the report said.
In contrast, this is a unequivocally slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed Phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the the Fed since the end of the last recession has been waiting for; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income is also volatile, as the market takes an increase in interest rates is anticipated, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect for bonds is faster than in the case of shares, if the change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease is done in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, the bond fall yields immediately, said Deutsche Bank.
The strategist of Charles Schwab, believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring in such a climate, better yields, although "we are still careful not to expect higher yields," said Kathy Jones, Fixed-Income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
It is interesting to note, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to the Fed-strategy-expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, Credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened their strategy.
All in all, companies that handle the larger part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates rise, local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies with high debt are worse off, because a rising Dollar makes their products in the global market, more expensive, and as well the financing of their debt.
"History shows that "quality" tend to share, three months after an initial rate increase to respond very positively to," said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report for the customer.
Companies with a strong balance sheet companies with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate hikes in 1994, 1999 and 2004, an average of 5 percentage points exceeded.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in its shares also outperformed their counterparts with lower quality on average in each of 4 (percentage points), and 3 (percentage points).
Debts become a big Problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most, said Goldman.
Outside of pure share a consumer will benefit games also due to the rising Dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even if the experts are of different opinion, how quickly will this take place.
