Seven's Sunrise has dominated the ratings, despite Attempts by Nine to take the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to rush to Canberra to report in connection to the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it has not produced any large shifts in the reviews for Today.
The Breakfast show of Nine was broadcast from the Federal capital, when Malcolm Turnbull made the downfall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, with the presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to be for Australian TV viewers to play no role, since Sunrise scored an average of 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, in comparison, Today 339.000.
Today recorded a slight increase over the Ratings for Monday (317.000) and last Tuesday (283.000), but his number was behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Yesterday has closed in the last few months the gap to Sunrise.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000, compared to the 330,000 of the Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the interval between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is at an average of 349.000 viewers to 314.000 in Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every Morning.
The winds of change regarding this morning people more than the Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the Review!
