The Free voters are demanding due to the high number of refugees, the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria figures.
Party - and party leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW-autumn exam in grosswallstadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools, if it were not for the many new students to new teachers: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will get distortions in the Bavarian educational system."
The parliamentary group of the Free voters in session until Friday in the lower Franconian municipality.
Actually, the whole of the other main topics were provided.
But the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters.
"Of course, the issue of asylum is superimposed on the exam," said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN-protected zones for refugees in Syria, as it did during the Yugoslavian wars in the nineties.
"It cannot continue like this, we need to get to the causes," said the Free voters-Chef.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the Free voters as quickly as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are for asylum claims responsibility: "We need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW-in-chief was critical of the fact that several States were not consistent: "We need uniform national Standards of the States."
"Bayern is not starting pushes, other."
"We have to be more capable of action."
But the land policy is not to fall in grosswallstadt under the table.
A year long duration, the burner is still on the agenda: the education and training policy.
For the new school year Minister of education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched at 47 schools in the pilot test of the "intermediate plus", an extension of the gymnasium, the intermediate level of three to four years will be tested in the result, it will take another nine years until graduation.
But Aiwanger far enough.
"The theme of G9 must be accelerated", said the FW-in-chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools want to.
Free travel to the G9 everywhere, where it is desired.
