Terraced houses for refugees, Single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner building in the Franconian city of Eckental number of houses for people who don't have a lot of money.
So for example, for refugees - but also as a Signal: "Not only refugees in need of Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and low income earners."
"I will show how one can, even today, cheap and good build," says the 44-Year-old in the Interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created: It builds in a project row houses for the refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many of the refugees are entering the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass housing in containers, or gyms has no sustainability.
Because the people remain to a large extent here.
In view of the refugee flow, we also need in the next few decades, plenty of living space.
A simple, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house needs the least amount of space.
It facilitates the Integration.
This is different when you bring people in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently built into the pilot project consists of three residential units for each of the four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a lounge.
It may be that many of the refugees are to say, it is peace again, I go back.
Then the houses can be converted easily according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro, without the land.
The is manageable.
Six months of the construction lasted.
The is appropriate.
Complicated building codes, your plans?
Gildner: by law I have withdrawn my project correctly.
Particularly complicated it's always, the looming sword of Damocles special construction and the Parking regulation.
Creepy.
It is always still, anyone who creates, in a row house of three apartments, one needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities of the place.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How was the reaction of the residents for your house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me, to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is not true.
But they are not increasing the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: True is: We had in the last five years, a construction boom in Germany, but luxury apartments that can barely afford a more were built.
My project has the message, even the normal people are in need of housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or low-income earners.
I show how one can, even today, cheap and good build.
That's about it.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and initially environmental analyses.
