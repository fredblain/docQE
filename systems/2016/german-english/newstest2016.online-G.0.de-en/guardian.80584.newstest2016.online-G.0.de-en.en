Experts criticize report from Public Health England about E-cigarettes
Allegations of a government-funded Agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than Smoking arose from a Meeting of 12 people, some with Connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), were joined by the Lancet, by criticizing the Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes used in evidence.
PHE has published the "basic report" in the last month, and describes him as a "comprehensive Review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data in question and highlighted the Connections between some of the experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal the Lancet last month to handle the "extremely windy" basis, the PHE his main conclusion is justified.
Two researchers writing in the BMJ, and asked whether the statements "build on rock or Sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Ã–ffentlichde health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cape corrugated, Professor of Clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health strategies on the demonstration of efficacy should be based."
They said that the Public expects, that the claim of PHE that "the current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than Smoking," based on a detailed Review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people, were convened in order to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis-MCDA) to guide their opinions about the harms of nicotine-containing products of a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said, that is a Sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose managing Director is previously from British American Tobacco middle (BAT) for an independent study.
He also references of BAT wrote to the Public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the Meetings said, to receive funds from an E-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing, he will have to Report in advance from the tobacco company Philip Morris International will receive, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the Board are not supplied, but several well-known E-cigarette Champions, some of which also specify a industries-Finance in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Expertise in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco-pipe of PHE took part.
The research work of the group, "admits, tellingly," that there is a lack of "hard Evidence of the damage of most of the products in most of the criteria," wrote McKee and Cape as well.
However, none of these Compounds or limitations in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Cape well said that the claims of PHE, that "there is no evidence that E-cigarettes as a way to Smoking for children or non-Smoking" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director for health and wellbeing at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously was not responding.
He said: "E-cigarettes are considerably less harmful than Smoking."
Every second of life long smokers dying of his Addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison to low, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to provide Information to the Public about what the evidence proves and what it is not, especially when so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a disease related to Smoking, and Smoking, the National health system costs two billion pounds per year.
Through the clear is not Present the current Evidence that E-cigarettes are not without risk, but only a fraction of the damage caused by Smoking, are present, we fulfill our national responsibility.
