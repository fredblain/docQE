Internet sales increased the most in August on slowly, and Black Friday can be responsible for that

In the last month, there was the lowest result since records began in the year 2000
Online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday has slowed down in November, the expenditure
For over a decade, the virtual shopping has boomed, and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into Ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs that the Online stagnate sales, after new Figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The total expenditure for the month of August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in the year 2000, with only a five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that Online sales are stagnating, after new Figures only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 indicated
"If you are the growth rates for previous years to consider, and until 2000, then has developed in the course of time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that the Online sales increased three years ago, began as a buyer to make their mobile purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online and that people were able to do this in different environments, e.g. at home on the Sofa.
But now, the swings, and we may experience that growth is reduced.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, as a reason for the decline in sales ends quotes.
Experts believe that buyers keep their purchases prior to this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
In the past year, the average number of shoppers flocked to five times to your Computer in order to make their bargain, and some of the dealer Websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, the buyer fought because of a bargain, might discourage buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that of Â£ 5 spending a little more than 1 pound was spent online.
For some products, such as televisions and washing machines more than a third of purchases are now carried out via Web-shop.
At the same time, more than a quarter of the people buy clothes and shoes online, rather than the fashion chains in the inner cities.
