The time of the decision on interest rates for the US Central Bank
The world is watching, if the US Central Bank comes on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, together, to make the important decision, whether for the first Time in nearly a decade, interest rates are raised or not.
A survey of 80 Economists surveyed by Reuters, found that a little more than half of that was last week, of the view that the Fed will do this, now thinks that the Fed will still remain a little longer and the interest rates will hold at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It is a historic event, because it's been seven years since the Fed has interest rates set to ZERO.
"For the first Time, we are approaching a Situation in which a large Central Bank leaves may be the Null area, and a process of normalization of interest rates starts," said Angel Ubide, a Senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low level of Inflation.
However, the Fed can't ignore the less-rosy Outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets that an increase in adjust, but the signs indicate that the chances against such a step are well.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
