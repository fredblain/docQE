'Sonogenetics can tax the brain cells by sound waves
The Video shows how the nematodes change direction in the Moment, in the sound pulses are irradiated.
Scientists have worms with genetically modified nervous systems bred, which can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment that you are with the sound impulses, which have for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard, to be irradiated.
The impetus to work through the Switching on of the motor neuron cells that have been genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said the worms showed the Power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, the ultrasound can be used to solve a series of brain-, heart -, and muscle-activating cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure might one day replace Deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure, the electrical impulses in the brain of people used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Roundworms do not typically respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic bubbles of air.
The blow, he found out, amplifying the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels and in the membranes of some of the worms cells are found.
The sound waves cause the Opening of ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-guided cyst nematodes, changed Chalasani genetically the worms so that some of your motoneurons TRP-4-carrying ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the changed creatures, bubbles in the sound waves by the micro-reinforced and in the worms, where you turn on to invoke the motoneurons.
The method has some Similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking Tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
In contrast to light, which must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain down, can pass through low frequency ultrasound waves the tissue without hindrance, and can be in the brain from the top to the skull sent.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic Virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound Signal in a clinical setting for specific neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and Insulin-producing cells, he added.
