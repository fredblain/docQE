Munich, Sylt and co.: The five most exclusive residential areas of Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg the most expensive residential complex, with views over the North sea, Wadden.
In the street, a square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average 73.300 Euro.
"On the island of Sylt, the range of objects is limited by nature", - stated in the study - so why the high price.
A new study shows in which particular layers of a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student flat in Munich is not really little.
In contrast to Germany's Top residential locations, the price is a but like Peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & VÃ¶lkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations, with prices per Square meter in dizzying heights.
Since several tens of thousands of euros are sometimes nothing - per square feet, mind you.
But well, who can afford to be ...
By the way: Munich is located here, for once, not at the top.
