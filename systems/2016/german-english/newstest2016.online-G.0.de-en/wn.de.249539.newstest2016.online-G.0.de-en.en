McLaren reserve driver Magnussen is out of action ...
Magnussen tweeted the photo and said that he had suffered the injury when he fell from the wheel.
He, therefore, is the night race in Singapore on the weekend, nor as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in question, like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
