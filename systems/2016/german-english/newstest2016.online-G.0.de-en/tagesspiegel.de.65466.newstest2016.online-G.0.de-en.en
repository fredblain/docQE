Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "We can do this"
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's coming to Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will continue to come according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the interior this year, according to Germany, according to a statement from Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany even able to a Million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated in the face of unusual challenge and determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do this".
What will happen to Germany, gives the following Overview.
Be used according to different forecasts between 350000 (as estimated by the Federal construction Ministry) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel-Institute) flats a year and the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as in the past, is built (250000 dwellings).
Dramatically, the lack of housing but especially in affordable rental properties: Year 60000 to 80000 falling out of social housing from Rent control, and particularly affordable housing will also apply to refugees.
Federal tree inisterin Barbara Hendricks (SPD) is planning to double the funding currently 518 million to a billion euros.
Much too little from the point of view of the Pestel-Institute: 80 000 social dwellings a year would need to occur and for the Federal government to invest should have a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year.
Agree scientists, and Federal tree inisterin are therein, that there should also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that in the long term, 55 percent of the Refugees in Germany, can be employed.
However, the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically according to their qualifications, to help you get started, writes Claudia Walter, project Manager for Integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the Integration of refugees is crucial, whether you find a job in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany it has given, according to Thränhardt a political turn: from the ban on employment for refugees for the recognition of work.
While there used to be a labour ban for asylum seekers for up to five years, this was reduced in February 2014 to three months, as well as the duty of residence, the asylum seeker to a place of residence restricted.
In the company of has - also due to the shortage of skilled workers - the majority of the view that refugees should be faster the access to the labour market.
A big hurdle for the access to the labour market lack of knowledge of the German language.
So far, there is not yet a sufficient supply of General and professional language courses.
Studies also show that the jobs to be taught most frequently through personal contacts.
The establishment of networks is therefore of the view that by Thränhardt, the Royal road to integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees parents give their children in the kindergartens, an estimated ten to 15 per cent: "For the uprooted parents, it is first of all important to keep the family together," says Ilya Koschembar, spokesman for the youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
The family still convince of the benefits of the nursery, and distributes the management handouts in different languages.
The demand for teachers should rise as a result of the large number of refugees that would try the Berlin Senate to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more trade and technical schools.
In the countries the students will be prepared without knowledge of the German language in the Welcome class to the lesson.
But they are not always aware of fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also from teachers, with only a qualification in English as a second language.
In them no defect, Beate Stoffers from Berlin's school administration says.
The Deutsche Studentenwerk is estimated that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no state of asylum seekers says or Tolerated the study - the only exception so far was Berlin, the Senator for the interior Frank Henkel (CDU) has abandoned its stance.
Studi willing refugees could be facilitated the access to higher education.
For refugees with a residence permit or toleration not receive benefits under the asylum seekers benefits act more, if you begin a course of study.
The latter do not get basically no student loans, as they fall under the circle of the bafög-entitled persons.
Tolerated refugees had to have four years in Germany lived to be Bafög-entitled from 1. January 2016, this margin is reduced to 15 months.
Also, this funding gap needs to be closed, ask Steffen noise, Berlin state Secretary for science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will in the future play a more important role, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many Religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should allow Islam to take over, with the same rights as you have, the churches, and the existing state-churches-to develop a new state-religions relationship.
Also important is the establishment of an Islamic would be welfare Association to take care of professionally to the newcomers.
To the Right also duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on a clear point of contact and be ready with the state in many areas to cooperate and give him a certain amount of control to give options.
This also includes the willingness to courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed on Thursday concern that religious conflicts could also be to Germany.
Those who wanted to play such conflicts in Germany, "to have immediately forfeited your right to dwell here, in Germany," he said on Bavarian radio.
He suggested to translate the basic law in Arabic.
Integration in the future will be much more even than it is today, a subject of the society as a whole.
This will also need to change the majority society, is the removal of discrimination and racism are becoming more pressing.
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - since less than a decade, anti-discrimination, and a General equality act.
But it learns very slowly, such as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and the authorities, the racist motive is systematically ignored.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups, non-white German long challenge and what international agreements such as the anti-racism Convention in Germany to undertake, must be in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful, and its new citizens to use their opportunities for the benefit of all.
Generally speaking, Germany was able to supply the previously expected refugees medically, says doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"What Man - Power and capacity is concerned, we create it," he told the daily mirror.
However, this extra money must flow into the System.
To avoid bottlenecks, calls Montgomery, to all comers at the time of registration, health cards.
Services provided could later be the States of settled.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable that so many people with the limited catalog of FOB off by the asylum seekers benefits act provides.
Otherwise, especially with the language barriers with the Doctors to create.
In the past, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, migrants are informed worse about their illnesses than other patients.
Not only in clinics, in doctor's offices, interpreters would have to be over the costs of calls for you.
Many of the refugees would be helped, but also with more General medical calls in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic views.
Among refugee children, there is significantly more untreated disabilities, and young people to HIV awareness.
With some of the other disease pictures of German Doctors come from their training but clear, says Montgomery.
"Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis, are not so difficult to recognize". And as for the shortage of Doctors, the refugees, perhaps even relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees were even Doctors.
To be able to practise, you must demonstrate your qualifications, and may again take exams.
At least half of the in Germany, incoming refugees, according to estimates by the Federal chamber of psychotherapists (BPtK) mentally ill: most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Particularly vulnerable refugee children, Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explained.
A recently published study of the TU Munich shows that one in every five Syrian refugee child traumatized in Germany arrives.
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, suffers from, among other things, to the so-called Flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and death anxiety.
Other symptoms of sleep - and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.
In order to prevent that the symptoms would chronic, early treatment is necessary, said Munz.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees, however, receive psychotherapy.
Although the mentally ill, asylum-seekers can ask at the end of in the social services, a request for a psychotherapy, but the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, would decide in the social services, mostly clerks or Doctors that are not trained for mental illness, whether treatment was necessary or not.
This often leads to misperceptions, says Munz.
