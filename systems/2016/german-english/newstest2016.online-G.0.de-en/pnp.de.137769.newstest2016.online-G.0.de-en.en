Twin offspring in Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about young in his Gorillas.
The 26-Year-old Dian, yesterday, brought twins to the world.
Twin births are Gorillas rarely.
The last in a German Zoo is nearly 50 years old and had been in 1967 in Frankfurt, said of the Zoo.
The gender of the newborn Gorilla twins are not fixed yet, as mother Dian holds you so far, close to the body.
First of all, the "had reports".
