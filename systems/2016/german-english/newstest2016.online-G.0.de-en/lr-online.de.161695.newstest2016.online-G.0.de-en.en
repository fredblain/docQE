Hoyerswerda: Small living assistance for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany.
To give you a warm Welcome, is not without the dedication of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda there are a whole range of people who support unselfishly asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine's body and soul to a teacher.
Also, with your 74 Lenzen she still teaches there.
Every Thursday she does it in the home for asylum seekers on Dillinger road.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan, to learn the German language.
Of course, the other lesson is as to a proper school.
