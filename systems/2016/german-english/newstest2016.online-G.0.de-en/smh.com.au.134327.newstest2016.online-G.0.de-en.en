Peter Moody claimed that Stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit the racing
Peter Moody claimed that the Stewards of Racing have tried to Victoria, to install in the past year, a spy in his stables, and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the integrity Department of Racing Victoria, and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratch of Lady Tatai because of a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and that he had himself found, under difficult conditions, as it went to the positive cobalt-swab sample at Lidaris, he can't explain.
He had held for 18 months because of the spying allegations back and didn't want it to "look like high-hanging grapes."
"I had nothing to say, and I have long been sitting on it, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know, it was on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going to go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to walk around head held high, and I want my owners think that I will try my Best for you.
To not think when you start, I do, then I should no longer be coach.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody's had the bomb in an Interview with racing.com high-that the integrity had been trying to Department, his Stall spy on.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat name in a room with a man - I will, if I am asked - and offered him a job in my stables, to provide information about what I'm doing in my stables," said Moody on Racing.com.
You seem to believe that I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, you should be certainly on your nose, because you have failed in the attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former. The Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, the current CEO of RVL, were at the time aware of and are now.
Should bring me to the view that it is personally?
Has Fig the RVL and perhaps people outside of the coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry?
I'm bad for the industry?
I'm so bad for the industry?
Maybe people think out there, that I am.
Maybe you need to take me for my license and me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying, can you now think about it.
But I'm now at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I'm going to put the pressure on you and push you to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The Frustration levels of the Trainers have built with the long-lasting cobalt-investigation, Lidari, and the Late Scratching led to the fact that he said that he "could throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar has been described by the race day-treatment rule, "ridiculous", after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for it," he said.
"One of my staff has erroneously applied the way the mud on the leg.
It would have been yesterday evening.
It could have been yesterday all day so, what was so.
It had been there but even so, on the day of the race.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the pack on race day. An inquiry into the matter was opened.
It is a joke.
People who establish these rules know nothing about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you went too far," said Moody.
