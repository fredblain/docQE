Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still hard
To face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but when selecting the squad, the England for the Tour, see, this is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair cook's side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, a youthful, positive attitude.
With the Ball, Moeen Ali developed as a Spin-Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, is an Option for the attack.
This related message: Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision of Adam Lyth to leave out, of course, is for me as a head coach in Yorkshire, and difficult to analyze.
In his seven Tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since, as I have said before - players are their own best selector.
A long time ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he fails, hopefully, more runs for Yorkshire, comes one more Chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss is not praised his attitude, even if he rendered such good services, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a Team man.
The question of how much time a Test batsman to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - such as Sam Robson in front of him, while Nick Compton nine got.
Only Compton got a Chance to home and away games.
The only criticism one can raise, was that England Trott first began Jonathan in the Caribbean - as Lyth in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a batsman that I would estimate to be high.
He is an X-factor-cricket player, what we saw in Yorkshire early this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge square, what struck us very much.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but this of course depends on the team line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea to let Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and four Quicks get, showed up, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a hit man can't hit, and this left-hander has already shown that he is one heck of a Cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his Job for his County, Worcestershire, but he is a number 3 for you, and since there is no big difference.
My former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests at first Drop, before he appeared in 2001 as an Opener.
He has made three hundred Runs immediately and not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes in the squad as Back-up Spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he has impressed me as a young man, very.
People may have their stats - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the Ball - and think it is a Punt, but there is no large number of Backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn on this Tour a lot.
Apart from the team of England has made a couple of clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahlah Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a Meistercoup.
He is one of the nicest guys of the game, will bring a Wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes on for the white ball Phase of the Tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he is created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a Coach, and how Mahlah, he has insights from which we benefit.
Sometimes new voices can bring in the locker room fresh Wind, even if the messages are in accordance with the foregoing.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One-Dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no Problem with it.
Some of you may not agree, but Coaches and team on the plates do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that, as for the players, their Jobs, the results depend on.
Such decisions are not taken lightly.
