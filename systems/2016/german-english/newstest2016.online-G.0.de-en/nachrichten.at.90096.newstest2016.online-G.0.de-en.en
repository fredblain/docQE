That Viktor Orbán sends many Thousands more of us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the warehouse Röszke immediately in the construction of structures, the humanity, to ensure that has brought our Chancellor, officially and publicly, the attitude of the Hungarian government into the orbit of national socialism.
Bear the brunt of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
Also the Refugees will need to find the "promised Land" you are invited and have been welcomed, nothing is as another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge, in view of the continuing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, we have decent conditions for protection seekers.
And it will be an even greater peace, security and stability in Austria to maintain.
