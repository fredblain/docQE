Di Maria hits on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG, Malmö is the place to pull.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were, of course, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria struck less than four minutes after the Start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player, brought the French champion on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities, before they increased their lead when Cavani in the 61. Minute, a headed goal to open the scoring.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in group A, Paris needed a strong Start against the Swedish Champions as they strive for qualification for the knockout rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game of Laurent Blanc's Team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed opportunities in front of goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown Team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career already in the year of 1999.
"It is not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League. Therefore, it is a good Start, to win 2:0, to cause our opponents problems and relaxed look back, even if there are certain things that we need to perfect in the course of the season," said Blanc.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we have not yet achieved one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three Changes in the Paris Team, which was able to hold on the weekend was a 2:2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the League, but he was upstaged in the fourth Minute through Di Maria.
The Argentine winger has been referred to as the man, the PSG can take to the next level in Europe, as he was taken in the last month from Manchester United, and he suggested, why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass in behind the Malmo defence, before he graduated to Johan Wiland over beautifully into the far corner of the net.
However, if someone believed that PSG would score a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmo, Celtic beat them in a Play-off to reach this level, competed in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a Five-man defence and two lined up deep in the midfield, a difficult opponent.
But apart from a shot from Thorsten kinhofer, far to Kevin Trapps post in the 34. A Minute went by, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG themselves were sometimes, with some misplaced passes and poor financial statements, not the least of Ibrahimovic, who bombed with no less than five attempts in the first half and then was abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless, he showed a lot more skill, when he brought his teammates into the game, and it's a Pass from Ibrahimovic, Di Maria turned in a turn and shot, which is of Wiland in the 52. A Minute was drawn past the post ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season, after Ibrahimovic had a left-wing cross from Maxwell up fishing.
That ended all thoughts of the fact that Malmo could get back into the game, and only an excellent Intervention from Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, was able to keep the final score low, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
The coach of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his Team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have not only played in the Swedish League, which has the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from you!
