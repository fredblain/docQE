FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that team-mates must stand before the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger told Wilshere, that it was only September, and if his Rehabilitation goes according to Plan, there is no reason why he can not play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer at the European championship is certainly still uncertain.
The great shame in this current Problem is that Wilshere had finished the last season, according to a separate ankle injury and then found back to his old swing during the preseason had to go back.
"This type of injury is not a threat to career," said Wenger.
It is a bone that did not heal well.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be from a purely medical point of view, true, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated danger of further injury, when a player is trying, in the middle of the season to return.
It is also an unpleasant pattern developing.
The investigation of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 of different diseases of Wilshere, since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal 157 League games in the last five seasons.
The wider picture for Arsenal is that they were in six of the eight seasons since 2007/08, one of the two Premier League Clubs that have suffered the most injury to-day.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will continue.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and combat power to win," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body has stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the Play against Chelsea on Saturday against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is a Rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu is likely to start Debuchy and Arteta.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and the players need to take a little breather," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites, through group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play areas with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is unbeaten after 41 Games, after the "invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was rocked on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, with the Richter scale, and 3.2 were measured.
This year it was the 10. in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the last season of the Champions League capitulation against Monaco, and the remains of the distant hope, driven to lead with his Management of the club its first European Cup Triumph.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It worked at Arsenal.
We were in the year 2006 very close to it, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in the business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
