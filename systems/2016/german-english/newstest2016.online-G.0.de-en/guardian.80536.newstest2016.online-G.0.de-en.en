Luke Shaw of Manchester United can not play for months because of a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven with a double fracture of his right leg.
While this defender brought the left to cry to him for at least six months from the Games, exclude, Louis van Gaal, the hope is that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was due to a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15 Minute causing, after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will come tomorrow or maybe a day later relocated and then in Manchester surgery.
It is terrible - a Boy, comes with 18 to Manchester United, it is very hard, and then fantastic play, and then this happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture then it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play this season.
Moreno seemed to be happy to be a Red card, and the imposition of a penalty-kick escape.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexicans.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself when I tell you that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account was: "I thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my road to recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger."

The only thing I could see was the Ball that was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] had touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
