Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber's Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
A mere 21 years young, a Linnet with top chic Frise.
The guy with the platinum blond hair, is 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Currently, Mr. Bieber in Berlin.
And the Generation of U17 by turns.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-Year-old has heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of Fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Including Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 o'clock in the morning, however, the Polish girl sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of Berlin's luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-construction: Here's your Idol whose posters hang abound in Szczecin lives, since Monday evening.
The Suite, in which the canadian singer lives, costs of the day just as much as your Mama Ewa earned in half a year.
If at all.
The says: "Actually, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the Gymnasium."
"I'm fulfilling a dream".
Education is compulsory?
Who cares?
The Fans do not.
Even Bieber himself is not.
Of the has already.
For the advertisement in the advertising break of the super bowl, he received three million, two year Deal with an Anti-pimple company many, many dollars flushed on Bieber's account.
And in the case of each doll, which looks like he is and over the counter, cashed Bieber.
If Justin Bieber is drinking a Cup of coffee, we are amazed at the Window.
More than 100 million, he should have captured.
Some say, the Hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new Single "What do you mean?" is # 1.
Bieber himself, whose fourth Album is due to follow in November, are not interested in a lot of zeros first.
At least he is doing so.
