Michael J. Fox jokes about his "Date" with Diana, Princess of Wales
The Premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great Moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also for personal reasons, remarkable.
"We were sitting in the Theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it will gradually clear that Princess Diana is sitting next to me," he said in a Trailer for an upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The Film begins, and it comes to me in the sense that I can be a simulated Yawn and an arm's length away am, with the Princess of Wales on a Date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents Interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had its Premiere 30 years ago.
"It is for me, really," said Spielberg, "without doubt, the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
