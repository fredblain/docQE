Certainly David Cameron, The Lorax knows better?
It is a thing that all parents soon learn: If your child is a book of loves, it will not take long until you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are, perhaps, David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, his favorite-to name a children's book, decided to the Prime Minister for The Lorax, in 1971, published in environmental fable by Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the Website of the company super camps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative, and with a powerful message, it is a book that I read to my children because it seems to always be a picture or a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, Cameron describes how, allegedly, the plot of the book, instead, a summary of the Film Version of 2012, the new characters and Details added, to extend the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all the nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he fulfilled their desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest of Dr. Seuss, whose real Name is Theodor Seuss Geisel was and died in 1991, however, completely unknown.
As if that wasn't suspicious enough of Cameron's Text reads, in part, as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the Website of the Internet Movie Database and so it begins: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, in hopes of a Boy named Ted, to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits Yes, to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron, the plot of the book is so little acquainted. Here is an unnamed Boy, how the local environment greedy by the money stops, trees cases, the Thneed knitting Once-ler, despite the protests of the Lorax, a squat, moustached beings, "speaks in the name of the trees", is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR has a delegated task to a helper that The Lorax didn't read 20 Times in a row to a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the Text was likely to come from Cameron's constituency office.
Super camps confirmed that the Text was supplied by Cameron's staff, but gave no other immediate comments.
