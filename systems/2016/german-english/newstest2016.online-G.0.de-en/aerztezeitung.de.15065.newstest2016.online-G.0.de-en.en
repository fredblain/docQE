Anyone who smokes has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smoke, which harms not only the lungs, but also the teeth - the Potsdam long-term study suggests.
The good news is that In the absence of the risk drops quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evident from the long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for nutritional research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
In comparison to non-smokers, the risk of losing your teeth prematurely and was in smokers, 2.5 - to 3.6-Fold higher.
The scientists had observed more than of 23,300 participants.
The main causes of Tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums stresses the DIfE.
For this periodontitis is a risk Smoking factor, stress the authors.
The connection between Smoking and tooth loss going back therefore to more frequent gingival inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear the extent to which Smoking also increases the risk for caries.
People who stopped Smoking, may reduce your risk but within a short period of time, write the researchers in the "Journal of Dental Research".
It can, however, take about ten years for the danger to sink back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of English, University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing from the DIfE: "Smoking shortens life time."
Not Smoking is good for lungs, and blood vessels and leads according to our findings, also to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, about 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by tooth loss, according to the DIfE.
Previous studies had already noted that Smoking increased the risk for early Tooth loss.
The new long-term study, the findings substantiate.
