8 survey values, the show that Donald Trump should be taken seriously.
Some have tried him as a Flop.
Others have him dismissed as a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to pull the Donald Trump of the top ranks in the polls below, it has not worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls, Donald Trump showed double-digit lead, and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate Moguls.
Of course, it is still too early in the term.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that to be delivered this time, in 2011, Rick Perry's guide to the ascendant Herman Cain, none of whom won a state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a General election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC, and the conservative business group Club for Growth Trumps now see-through and start to make your dollars flow, to overthrow him.
Here are some of the current survey are not values that indicate that the real estate Mogul is only a temporary Phase:
Trump's popularity ratings have turned around 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, showed a poll by the Monmouth University that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate Mogul is positive.
Until the middle of July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.
And these Numbers hold in the early States.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters the GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a survey conducted by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either "delighted" or "satisfied", if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "delighted" vs. 40 percent who say the same thing about Trump).
The next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they are "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush is the favorite of the Establishment, the candidate would be.
A majority of Republicans Trumps Temperament does not see as a Problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for its bombastic and offensive statements, believe 52 per cent of the to tend to the Republicans, the Irish voters that the real estate Mogul have the right Temperament for a President, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number is in the first pre-election state of the Nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality of a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 percent do not think that he had the personality to effectively be the office, and almost six out of 10 Independents say that his Temperament did not fit into the White house, so ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When you put your Gelehrtenh√ºte, to keep Republican voters Trump for real.
When you are asked who will win the most the GOP nomination, say according to a poll by CNN/ORC from last week's four out of ten, that Trump was the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July your money on Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: GOP voters the clearest crystal ball had not in the past.
To thinking at this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Romney, Mitt.
However, a variety of GOP voters Trumps reputation campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to trump leadership, while the Anti-Trump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates, diffuse.
But a survey by the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most of the other Republican candidates, Trump the majority garners support.
He has Carly Fiorina a 13-point lead, ahead of Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker with 15 points, ahead of Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, in front of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie's 33 points.
It is a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who beats him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A slight majority of Donald-Trump-Fans says that you have formed your opinion.
A new survey from CBS/NYT on Tuesday, shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump, say that you have awarded your votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really tell you to never change the opinion.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, trump's strongest competition at the Moment, the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that you have formed your opinion, are twice as likely to be for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump said in his campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico, "rapist", was turning the immigration the focal point in the public discourse to 2016.
Some are worried that the bombastic manner of expression, Trump will hold a crucial Hispano-Americans from the Republican party remote and the Neuorientierungs efforts will damage it.
But according to the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump in matters of immigration.
Thus, as long as immigration stays in the spotlight, Donald Trump, apparently.
The Frustration over the government's climb to new highs.
On Donald Trump and Ben Carson about half of the support of Republican voters now account for, especially by their outsider Status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say the new Monday survey of ABC/Post, you prefer a political outsider as someone with government experience.
And they are also angry at Washington.
A survey of the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa two weeks ago, shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans than the Republicans are frustrated in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellishly angry".
