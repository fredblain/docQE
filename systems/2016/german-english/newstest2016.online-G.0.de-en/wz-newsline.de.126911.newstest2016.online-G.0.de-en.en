Gaultier feels too old for an Enfant terrible
It is a mixture of great fashion show and a wax chamber of horrors: The Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) has unveiled on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition on his work.
The highlights: mannequins, human appearance, thanks to video projections, scary.
You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who was, among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits to the big Star of the fashion scene and that he put men in skirts.
"I can say today that I am the Enfant terrible of Haute Couture, because I have white hair."
"Before, it was bleached and now it's real," said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From the sidewalk to the catwalk), the of 18. September is to be seen in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initial negative attitude to a Look about his Person.
Actually, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition of sound a bit like death," he said.
If you die, you come to the Museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in the canadian city of Montreal and in Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than beautiful dresses," said the Director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is a matter of tolerance, acceptance and the Vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the has hardly written overview at the end of the work of the man, the history of fashion, without ever training completed.
Chronologically, the Exhibition is not constructed, but it is a superbly choreographed a total work of art, for the lots of effort was put: to style the dolls, was hired for example, a dedicated Stylist.
14 tons of Material have been carted off to the creators, according to the curator, Thierry-Maxime Loriot to Munich.
Shortly before the Start of the Oktoberfest, a special treat was yet to come: a Lederhosen Outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He had always been interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a little bit different, said Gaultier.
Even Gaultier's old Teddy bear is on display in the exhibition.
He is the first, timid fashionable steps of the designer.
As a child (he is not a good student, and bad at football) he has attracted to his Teddy, Bras and dresses, said Gaultier.
To play with a doll, they would not have allowed his parents to him.
The Design of fashion he had taught later on.
He stole fashion magazines and the designs of other designers, such as Gaultier told me in Munich.
Later I bought the then but of course.
For his first fashion show, he said, the Models do not pay.
You got nothing, but had to keep the clothes.
