The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages threaten the Expansion.
The managing Director of JD Sports, Peter Cowgill said that a higher minimum wage for UK workers "could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it was unlikely that the purchasing power of the higher labor costs in its company will compensate, he says.
The cost could meet the expansion plans by JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
