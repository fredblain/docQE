The last three agree: the Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly apparently, who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, in Sam Wood in The Bachelor finally ends up, has been shrouded in greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give the price, whether she is the one that has received the last Rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows, the day before two out of three, you may be given accidentally a clue as to who will be the winner.
Sam Wood is holding his lips up to the finals on Thursday sealed
All three women have skipped on lyrical way, about why Wood is the perfect man, and called his sense of Humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like his partner to be.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should Woods get the last Rose?", could be your answers to the Killjoy, who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows, and Markoski called both of them quickly - except for yourself - Mackay, as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had from day one a simple relationship to each other.
"From the Moment I walked into the house, and (Sarah's) and Sam's energies noticed, because I felt that they were pretty compatible, and I thought that in the whole course of the Show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the earth, it's so much fun to be with her," added Markoski.
I've seen you together, and you have the right chemistry.
You will feel enjoyable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood as a Few well-would be suitable.
In their view, Mackay said that the home visit last week made it clear to her that "could be Wood".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, not, it was clear to me that this is obviously just a game - I am now set unconditionally to him," she said.
And when she was asked whom to choose Wood, if not you, since you was a mystery.
"I don't know if I can say this," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday at 19:30 on Ten.
