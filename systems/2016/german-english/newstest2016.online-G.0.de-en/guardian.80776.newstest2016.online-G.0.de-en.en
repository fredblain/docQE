Eight Golden rules for living in halls of residence
Eleven years ago, I as a self-forgotten 19-Year old in a Dorm, still in the Faith of Berets and moral relativism, but it is only now that I remember the strained Smiles of those who I have annoyed and to the numerous, long-winded complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The catchment in the student residences ranges from the slightly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It is tempting to talk to: people tell where you come from, whether and where you the Sabbath, have taken, where they stand in relation to Corbyn and why you "honestly Marmite neither love nor hate, because Seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Take a deep breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you people find out that you like, in contrast to those with whom you would not speak, even if your eyelashes were on fire, and this fire extinguisher would be.
You Can People.
The room of people transform often, drinks receptions, Film-night venues and local hangouts, but they are also the Places where people wear their underwear right now.
Related to: not remember, at University, with a relationship to start
Introverts get a rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refuge, but many of the student residences to form a room-to-room-shopping-culture that is friendly and social, and to lead life-long friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away, so I get the energy I've consumed for the interaction with you."
You try to feel, when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted and you send him a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of waiting: Do it.
A guy in my student halls of residence had the idea that a locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friends by baking.
As you start University at the height of the Baking-mania, is the Knock on the doors of people to come up with a plate full of Brownies to present less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."
Homemade Treats are a good way to make friends is to offer.
Your roommate feel obligated to entertain, and will associate at the end of maybe your face with a delicious Surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.
Bad lumps from flour, sugar, and fat mixed cause people to be asleep when you knocked.
To steal food, homes, a common crime in student housing.
Of course, the Mouth of chicken is a theft, but it is Taking a drop of Lactobacillus for your tea?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that you say to support yourself, even if you cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but they are trying to make a balanced deal as my roommate, the milk a detergent added, to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make any noise, the people from sleep or work.
It's not just about being a decent human being, but that they belong in the truest sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl on my floor asked your neighbors whether you'd mind, to Drum & Bass a bit quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and you had an exam Tomorrow.
They responded with even louder music.
When they stopped, finally, at 5 o'clock, let your neighbors in a friendly manner, sleep on it for two hours before they had their own music blaring, your door graduated and went of their three-hour examination.
It would be romantic, if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same Dorm?
Conversely, it would not be profoundly embarrassed if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, you go for it, again disconnect and you will then have to see every day and maybe see how she pulls all the common friends to be over?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, try to at least, to your abdomen a bit of reason to convince.
In the exciting Moment in which you notice that someone let his keys in his locked room, is the border between a joke and bullying is fine, as it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it just eyes take glances, until he becomes a boomerang.
You give by Hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but they mess it up never someone's room with toothpaste and Shampoo.
You close your door and place your keys in a glass of water, which is then set in the freezer - but you staple your possessions to the ceiling is not more than twice.
