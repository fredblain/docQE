Detroit Tigers sneak to the Minnesota Twins over
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was for the Detroit Tigers not particularly funny.
Earlier you were once one of the best Teams in Baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as a Spoiler, played this Part, however, on Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins wasted a Chance to climb within a game and half the Houston Astros for the second American League Wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for a night, it was a return of the three-letter F-word that was a large part of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers Pitcher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support as the Detroit three Times in the first two Innings and scored, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 Innings and allowed three Runs.
It was his third successful Start in his last nine games.
"I want to finish this year strong," said Simon.
It's hard to throw in the Bullpen every game, and that is why I want to go in all the way focused in the game.
The designated Tiger Hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and two Runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three-Hit game from Martinez, and since then, he has four Hits against the Seattle Mariners on may 6. July had.
"He has swung the bat well," said Ausmus.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked significantly better in the Bullpen, and he brought it into the game.
With three Runs in the background at the end of the seventh Inning, the Twins had their best Chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the Inning with a double to the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached on a Bunt, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to Strikeout before he was replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy turned the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted in front of the designated Rookie hitter Miguel Sano, of the right-handers Drew Verhagen, a Two-Run tore.
With a Pair of runners and the final-Run in the second Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a Double Play.
It is the in the Major League-leading 27. Time this season that Plouffe hit a Double Play
After Detroit added at the end of the ninth Inning, an Insurance Run, and made a wall for a RBI-double against the Closer of the Tigers, Bruce Rondon and scored the 5-4.
The right-hander stood out, however, Sano on three Pitches for his fifth Save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a non-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three Runs in the first two Innings against the right-handed Veteran who had been deleted before the game from the injured list after he had missed because of a back complaint more than a month.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable, as I began, I felt that I would create some pretty good Pitches in the third Inning".
After you got in the first, the Leadoff-Batter, gave Hushes a Single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out Walk to J. D. Martinez that brought Victor Martinez to the game, managed to put a Single "up the middle" at the first Run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 streak of success with runners in Scoring Position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a Single to the right side, managed another Run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game, as he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The Tigers picked up in the second, achieved a One-Out Double from Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out Single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said Twins Manager Paul Molitor.
He has not hit particularly well, but he got to the right place.
Hughes was in a Pitch-Count, scored no points in the third Inning before he was replaced by Reliever right-hander A. J. Achter.
In the case of Hughes, it came down to three Runs on six Hits and a Walk with four Strikeouts.
