Robot cars: government wants leading role for Germany
Germany is supposed to be according to the will of the Federal government in the transformation of the car is a technological pioneer.
The Federal Cabinet approved on Wednesday a policy paper from the house of transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for, among other things, investments in the Expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the auto show IAA of a "new era in mobility".
The automated and connected Driving will increase road safety and less congestion to worry, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, which come together at the IAA, also with representatives of the industry.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion, and a rapid transition to digital radio.
For the testing of new technology, a test is currently being built distance on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
The rider of the "no additional liability risks to be saddled with" wants to check the Federal government the legal framework ", and, where necessary, to the new developments to adapt".
So to use Germany, for example, at international level, the maximum allowable speed for self-driving will be raised at the end of cars from 10 to 130 kilometres an hour.
The Federal government wants to call for an Amendment to the Vienna Convention, which provides, so far, only the people as a driver.
In automated Driving, the car takes on, increasingly, the leadership, the driver is more and more to the passenger.
The technology is based on Sensors and cameras that capture the environment and the data in a matter of seconds to process.
According to the Ministry of economy submitted to the study, highly automated Driving on motorways by 2020 is technically possible.
Nevertheless, the driver can be expected lots of vehicles on public roads "after 2020".
The value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany will appreciate the authors of the study for 2025, to around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of Cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport", said the SPD transport policy-makers SÃ¶ren Bartol.
The question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clarified.
Even the Germans see self-driving cars, however, skeptical - a lot more than the French or Americans.
A on Wednesday at the AA presented a survey conducted by the Forsa Institute on behalf of testing organisation Dekra has come to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that Autonomous driving will win out in the end cars in the next ten years, 32 percent don't expect in 20 years, 31 per cent believe it at all.
In France 21 percent of those surveyed expect by 2025 autonomously driving cars, in the USA, 33 per cent.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital Association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to be in control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the highway, the could imagine in free-flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in a traffic jam 45 percent.
Well, every Fourth would leave the car in control under any circumstances.
