Man to wet police pursuit persuaded to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale police officer remained dry, as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth, the police hang out, was unsuccessful, as he was in the shallow and marshy water, only a few metres away from a police officer away and tried "to persuade him gently to the shore to return to."
The police, of Canning Vale was launched on Tuesday to a trespassing incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the Suspect tried to escape in the direction of the Canning River.
But he didn't come too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not negotiated too excited about it, making his Uniform wet, so he turned to a more reliable tactic - "A good COP".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship-football player Ben Cousins offers a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the ditch to avoid an alcohol-control, and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired Locals to the humorous planning a Ben Cousins Biathlon.
