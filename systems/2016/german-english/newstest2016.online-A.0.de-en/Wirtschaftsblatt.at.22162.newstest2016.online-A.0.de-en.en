Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement, as well as Tehran's destabilizing actions in the Middle East.
The meeting will be also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-State solution, which is discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is stretched for years.
Washington criticizes Israel's ongoing settlement construction, and accused Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal promoted by Obama to the Iranian nuclear program, the relationship between of the two has deteriorated further.
In March, Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the US Congress, which partly was seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not discussed with Obama, a meeting had rejected this with reference to the then forthcoming elections in Israel.
