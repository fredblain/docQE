Seehofer: "borders are not closed"
In a long phone call with the Bavarian Minister-President Horst Seehofer (CSU), Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) has agreed the way forward on the refugee issue on Monday.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off.
The onward travel of refugees in the Federal Republic was still possible.
However, there are in just the appropriate border controls.
With refugees to Germany there will be for the time being no more special trains.
The people would associated, however, with regular trains to Germany.
Pühringer demanded even greater solidarity on the refugee issue from the other EU Member States.
"A logical consequence" from the approach of the Germans for Pühringer is also Austria's borders to introduce controls again.
