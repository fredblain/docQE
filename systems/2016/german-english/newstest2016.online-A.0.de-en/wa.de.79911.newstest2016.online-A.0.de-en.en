Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) the Crown of thorns is one of the major works, painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.
Klaus senior post has written the introduction and updated texts of the Bible.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar ALT Bible, which now appeared with splendid images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects.
The 75-year old has received his "language" with bright colours and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.
On the contrary: the respective topics adapted can have a quite quite bleak.
Three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Cycles, which are dedicated to topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, bids, or Lord's prayer were created.
Thus he has fascinated spontaneously several partners: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books.
And especially the author Klaus senior post, which dealt with the respective places of the Bible based on the painting.
He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so today, in the current context "translated into".
These texts are like verbal mirror of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each set of the artist of who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here.
The cover of jewelry has golden letters.
Thus the 75th allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions double.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately ever trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in New York City born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church order.
"As the education happened already with the cane", recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work this might again get me along with the father".
His second concern was to restore the art to more important in fast-moving time: "the perception of imagery is today characterized by advertising, and is noisy.
Symbolism is as displaced.
Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.
Images have always something mysterious and not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants to, discover that the viewer into the pictures "fall into", they let on, and feel what power they have: "The image is looking his counterpart".
Klaus senior post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar ALT Bible in the Otmar ALT Foundation, "has always been" a lover of Otmar ALTs art to have been: "I like how he sees life with his paintings".
Old did not care fully to capture the Bible, but important, even mysterious themes selected for him.
Alte post "That was no cooperation at eye level," says: "this is the images, the text explains only". a picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler by Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar ALTs images speak the (Biblical) language of love as well as the responsibility for Möhler.
A part of the original paper and canvas images - will be presented in an exhibition, which opens on November 15 in the Otmar ALT Foundation.
