Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sports Hall
The Municipal Council of Bernried approved the planning application for the 2.3 million euro Sports Hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof should be flat for solar system.
Plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernrieder sports area step by step progress: in the most recent Council meeting was unanimously endorsed the elaborate planning application without major discussions.
Previously, the Panel decided to include an application for a construction law "exception" or "Liberation" from the current development plan.
It was the "exception" permission for a special form on the roof.
Therefore, a "saddle roof with non-central first and roof overhang" will be built.
Planning is the intended use of the roof for solar panels: "As a result we get together a wonderfully large roof of the South", declared at the meeting Mayor Josef Steigenberger.
The "liberation" was, in turn, to the roof inclination, which should be below 10 degrees for energy reasons â€“ other than prescribed in the zoning -.
This significantly reduces the volume of the Hall.
A "liberation" was necessary because the development plan with regard to the roof pitch is no "exceptions" - where the Bernrieder rather restrictive moves Municipal Council normally for exemption applications.
The gym building is, however, no recurring project: "We create no precedent", so Steigenberger.
The gym at the Sports Centre is a joint project between the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Around 2.3 million euros are included at cost.
Grants are expected from the school and grassroots support.
In the next step, the planning application for the 18 x 36 meter Hall is now submitted to the District Office for the examination.
