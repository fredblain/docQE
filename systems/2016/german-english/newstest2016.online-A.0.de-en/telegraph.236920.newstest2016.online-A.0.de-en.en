FC arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must be ahead of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger compared Wilshere to stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given its history, its participation is still uncertain in the next summer at the European Championships.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere after a separate ankle injury had finished last season strongly, and then back to his old swing had returned during the previous season.
"This kind of injury threatened not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone that is not well healed.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was in conjunction with his ankles or the injuries that he had before.
That may be true from a purely medical standpoint, but as Wenger also recognized, there are the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It developed also an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 League games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for arsenal is that they Premier were League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 of one of the two, which have recorded the most days of the injury.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and have to win power", said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and to treat those who need it, a small breather," Wenger said.
Although arsenal are favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is undefeated after 41 games, after the "Invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the Club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked for arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in business to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
