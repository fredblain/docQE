The last three are the same: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret unveiled?...
Lana Jeavons-fellows, Sarah Mackay, and Snezana Marko ski may unknowingly apparently have, whoever wins the Bachelor.
The woman at the Sam Wood in the Bachelor finally lands, was covered in the greatest secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will not reveal certainly, if she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked on the day before two out of three, with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Marko ski and Lana Jeavons-fellows, you don't have a clue may inadvertently, who will be the winner.
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women have left out in lyrical terms is why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as the reasons, why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "if not you, who should receive Woods last rose?", could be their answers to the killjoy who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-fellows and Marko ski called both fast - besides himself - Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had with each other from the first day to a simple relationship.
"From the moment I walked into the House and noticed (Sarah's) and Sam's energies, as I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that in the entire course of the show," said Jeavons-fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the Earth, it is so much fun to be with her," Marko ski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From their point of view Mackay said that the home visit last week her clear made that that wood could be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is not only a game - I'm now fully set on him," she said.
And when she was asked, who wood should if not choose it, because it was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the leftover girls alike - it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Wednesday, 19:30, on ten.
