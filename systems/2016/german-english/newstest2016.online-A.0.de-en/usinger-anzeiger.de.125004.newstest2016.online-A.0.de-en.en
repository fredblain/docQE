"Cassini" spacecraft finds Saturn's moon of Enceladus Ocean
A global ocean spills under the ice of the Saturn moon of Enceladus.
The conclusion researchers from observations of the "Cassini".
Thus the Moon wobbles slightly on its orbit around the ringed planet.
This wobble is only small but too big for a continuous solid celestial body, said in a statement of Cornell University in Ithaca (New York State) from Tuesday.
The researchers present their analysis in the journal "Icarus".
Already, it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice of Enceladus.
So "Cassini" had discovered 2006 ice volcanoes at the South Pole of Saturn moon, which spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole, there must be a subterranean sea, the astronomers concluded at that time.
The expansion of the hidden Ocean was, however, not clear.
