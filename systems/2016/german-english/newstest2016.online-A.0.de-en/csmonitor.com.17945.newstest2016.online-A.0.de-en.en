This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates
Comes an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance to the end for the economy.
A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react.
Therefore, representatives of the US Federal Reserve have stressed so violently that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather is the length of time required for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
At the end, market participants, however, may find that all the fuss because a rate increase was may be exaggerated.
"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of"cheap money"", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at capital economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a too low level, to fear the to the seismic shock, many seem to lead.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.
Here is a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make volatile things for a while.
As soon as the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There is apparently a trend stalled investment income 12 to 24 months after the first increase which again reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the Fed interest rate increases.
Specifically, the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days (average 2.6 percent gain), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis, the Bob doll, Chief Investment Strategist at Nuveen asset management, at Barron's published.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks later tend to occur in the cycle and the return begins to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but often promote increases in interest rates.
In the current case, the fed with some conditions is facing, which did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.
It is quite remarkable that gross domestic product near its lowest point the Fed's interest rate increases will be.
According to Deutsche Bank was the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in a so fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it this time is different", said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have made cool all year round on an interest rate increase in the fed, and all eyes were directed the meeting of the Federal open market Committee this week which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study all increase in cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP have taken place and made previous recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade", according to the report.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far are 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares, if the change its strategic course.
For bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause that yields between shorter and longer bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds better yields often bring in such a climate, although "we are cautious to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to expectations of fed strategy.
"There are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations" she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have been extended and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightened up its strategy.
On the whole, companies which handle the greater part of their business in the United States, benefit if interest rates rise, and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high levels of debt are worse position, as a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.
"History shows that"Quality"stocks tend to react, three months after an initial increase in interest rates very positive" Sachs analysts in a report for the customers said Goldman.
Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded after each of the interest rate increases by 5 percentage points in 1994, 1999 and 2004 an average companies with weak balance sheet.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks exceeded even their counterparts with low quality on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt is a big problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.
Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts of disagree, how quickly this will happen.
