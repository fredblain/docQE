Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's question time
Since his election, Mr. Corbyns debut at question time of the Prime Minister with tension is expected
The new labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's question time and mess with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr CORBYN will rise shortly after noon to make the first of his six questions, with its performance by the media likely and the Labour Members closely examined.
He called for "Less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.
He has also said that he could skip some meetings, to leave to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the annual meeting of the TUC on Tuesday.
In the meantime, has provoked the decision of the labour Chairman, to remain on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyns decision to sing not the national anthem, has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr CORBYN said he would have "in respectful silence been" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain".
But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC two Newsnight programme he advised the labour Chairman, to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Almost a dozen of shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team and they refer to differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also within "stack of labour" according to Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and limit profits.
Mr CORBYN said the TUC Conference that labour submit changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall.
Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions Minister said hours later that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the Government's plans, the limit of 26,000 pounds to Â£23,000 to lower.
Mr CORBYN will be the fifth labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, over the past decade on the dispatch box in the House, facing.
The labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from "Repartee" and fights with barbs both and instead has undertaken, to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.
Mr CORBYN said Angela Eagle, the shadow economic Minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is abroad.
He has brought the idea into the conversation, that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he approached John Bercow, the speaker of the lower House, to discuss the problem.
When he became leader in the year 2005, Mr Cameron said that he would remove from the policy in the style of a "puppet theatre", which is often associated with the Prime Minister question time is. but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.
Because it was sent first in 1990 in television, question time was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of the leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature, and would require far-reaching reforms.
