Five brotherhood members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman
For almost two years, after a student died during a vexatious ritual of a student fraternity in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College PI Delta PSI fraternity attacked brutally Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, and police said his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, delayed.
Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged, and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go to a frozen field to a target.
Mr.. Deng complained finally of headache, then he fell unconscious.
The PI Delta PSI fraternity members called not the emergency number 911, after Deng was unconscious and the police reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital.
They had, however, the time to Deng's clothes to change, to contact his symptoms to Googling and Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, in order to obtain advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide items and put the brotherhood basically about the welfare of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been through the harassment of the brotherhood destroyed. Since 1970, at least one student dies every year of the harassment", said Douglas adapted mountain, a lawyer, represents the Deng's family in a statement.
Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.
A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are accused also because of oppressive attacks and forming a criminal organisation.
"We want to blame not only the people involved, but if there is an organization, which, officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.
