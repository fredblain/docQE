That Viktor Orbán sends more thousands to us, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of in the camp Röszke immediately in the construction of structures to help, ensuring humanity, our Chancellor has officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian Government in the atmosphere of national socialism.
The victims of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing in the border areas with chaotic conditions.
Also the refugees will have to determine that the "promised land", which has been invited and welcomed, is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the continuing flows of refugees and the onset of winter, to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers in us.
And it is an even bigger – peace, to maintain security and stability in Austria.
