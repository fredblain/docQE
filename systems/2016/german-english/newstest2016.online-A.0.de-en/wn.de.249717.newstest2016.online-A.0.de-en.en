Robot cars: Government will lead for Germany
Germany should be according to the will of the Federal Government in the change of the car of technology pioneer.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet decided a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investment in digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show of a "new age of mobility".
Automated and networked driving will improve road safety and congestion, said Dobrindt.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, which come together with representatives of the industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of transport stresses the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
A test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being built for the testing of new technology.
So that the driver "no additional liability risks imposed be", wants the Federal Government the legal framework "review and, where necessary, adapt to new developments".
So Germany will advocate as internationally, increase the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government wants to support also a change of the Vienna Convention, which provides for only the people as a driver.
When automated driving the car takes the lead in increasing, more and more the driver to the passenger.
The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads were "until well after 2020 to be expected".
The authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros will appreciate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany.
"Can the digital networking of the car to the increased safety and efficiency in road transport lead", the transport politician SÃ¶ren Bartol said.
The issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly understood.
Still, the Germans see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey presented on Wednesday to the AA of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the DEKRA testing organisation comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars over the next ten years will prevail, 32 percent believe only in 20 years, 31 percent believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33 percent by 2025 with self-driving cars in the United States.
Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.
According to a survey of the digital Association BITKOM, only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the Highway 15 percent could imagine in traffic anyway, in a traffic jam 45 percent.
Every fourth car would leave control under any circumstances.
