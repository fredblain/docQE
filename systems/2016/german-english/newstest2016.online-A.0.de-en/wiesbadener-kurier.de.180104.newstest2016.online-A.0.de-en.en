Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
The Chief Executive of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, according to several reports, has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in the House of his brother in the United States, he had fallen after midnight on a water glass he was wearing in the left hand, reports the "Wirtschaftswoche" on Wednesday.
"He is almost bleeding to death, was unconscious, dragged out onto the street - he told to us last week," cited the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott could but go about his work.
"Early October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf", PLATTNER said.
The 54-year-old manager was at the meeting and "fully operational".
In an interview with the "SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday Edition), McDermott announced he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, fully in my job."
"Of course I was all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner," said McDermott of "SZ".
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, since the summer but he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf, Germany.
It is important to go with a such personal history to the public, he said the Manager of the "SZ": "Something can happen to anyone."
"Is important, get up when you fall for."
