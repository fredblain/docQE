In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb, it was important to emphasize that his "cute dog" but still alive and was probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the House, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note was scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me". This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.
There was no indication that lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled already 300 miles to the school, where he shot a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his Office and killed according to the police.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said that lamb has made the fateful call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day, there was a further death: lamb took his own life, when the police surrounded him up.
A day after the shooting in the University, forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.
That helped by the investigators at both ends of the State of published details, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.
The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there are some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
A student, Brandon beavers, who praised lamb, said he seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something is wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with stress.
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, and it said that he had some health problem.
In this year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic way to a job as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that can no longer answer lamb.
After escaping from the campus, the police of later lambs found track when he won back in Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested lamb killed himself selbstmit a.38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a House about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner met Hel Johnson.
His car was still in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why lamb to this House went, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb was raised in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.
He earned his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of the longtime friends of lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who some years tried to teach her how to play the guitar.
He was at that time the heart-throb.
All the girls melted away, when he was", said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time.
In the emergency, lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.
The police said that was the dog in order.
The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn o' Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago were, but remained friends and had a daughter, which was now 19 years old.
"She was totally devastated", o' Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were best friends.
O' Steen said he never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, he and Abigail were both on a summer fair three years ago.
Later, they played together the occasional gig.
O' Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment Coordinator at the Julep room, a dimly lit bar near the town of Gautier, said that he September 5 for the last time saw lamb and Prentiss night at night, after lamb finished in front of a sparse crowd had finished his guitar and harmonica.
There was no evidence to suggest that there was something wrong.
He said "just a happy couple".
We were cleaning up and joked with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead Professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his fraternity and the Student Committee.
On the campus of Delta State in Cleveland, 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community in a candlelight commemoration took part on Tuesday night about.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also at the vigil took part, while the University Choir "bright morning star" and sang "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Authors Emily wagon first of Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans were Associated Press report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the distress call, after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb Prentiss although described in his distress call as his wife, but there is no indication that that the two were ever married.
