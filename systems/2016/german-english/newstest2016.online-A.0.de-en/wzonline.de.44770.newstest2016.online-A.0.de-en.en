Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" movie
You should not touch legends Yes, but Disney still dares to a new movie of his classic "Mary Poppins".
This is according to the "Entertainment Weekly" but not a remake, but a kind of sequel, which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It comes to the experience of the nanny with the family banks in times of the great depression in England.
Who plays more than 50 years after Julie Andrews Poppins, is still unclear.
But the Director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
