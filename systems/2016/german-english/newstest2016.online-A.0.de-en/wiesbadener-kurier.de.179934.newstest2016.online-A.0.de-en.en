DFB intensified commitment to refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga is a clear sign on the weekend.
Football responded to the worsening situation in Germany and pledged his help in dealing with the problems of policy.
"I think that the biggest challenge of our country since reunification."
"Since no one can say in principle, that doesn't concern me, I have nothing to do."
"This should interest every one to get this issue", said DFB Chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin he intends to discuss intensively the refugee situation in Germany.
"I'm next Wednesday in the Chancellor's Office and meet the Minister Mrs Özoğuz and the Chancellor there."
"Since the theme will play certainly a central role", he announced.
Football could and would help.
But, the policy must set the decisive course.
The German Football Federation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
Niersbach said "About the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have made sure that this program will continue until 2019", on the verge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's / Malta.
Some Bundesliga support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs send a clear signal if they "Help - #refugeeswelcome" will carry the imprint on the left sleeve of the Jersey instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
"We want to make it also clear that everyone should help where and how they can", said Leverkusen Sports Director Rudi Völler (Tuesday) the "Bild" newspaper, and described the project as a "Matter of course".
"The refugee drama concerns everyone, no one can look away."
"We can Bundesliga, no, we have to our power, our influence and our opportunities use to help the many refugees who have suffered already so incredibly,", said Hertha Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim General Manager Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign in the League".
To the European Championship qualifier against Hungary on Friday, the national team of Women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach called the support of refugees as "a great community work German football".
That all 36 licensed clubs in their places had started their own projects, was great.
Just as great is that small and very small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have spent is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and the next year, the Association together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 EUR for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have obtained already the whole sum for 2015", said Niersbach.
