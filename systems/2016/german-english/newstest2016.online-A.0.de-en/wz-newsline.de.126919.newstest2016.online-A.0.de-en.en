Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
Earlier it wanted on the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were built in large quantities for customers who processed it to blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer, explained Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion tip of Plauen.
Instead, the fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now is being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cited some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.
Even the so-called vintage clothing, similar to past eras, make a growing job potential.
Who uses any niches in the textile industry in Germany, is no longer on the market.
With us they account for half of all orders.
Fashion tip Plauen along with nine other companies is a member of the industry association of Plauen lace and embroidery.
They may carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales were broken off.
There are almost no longer private shops and also wholesale.
Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.
The mass-produced will today much more cheaply produced in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains.
Also schwächle the export, currently in the United States and Russia.
Plenty of reasons for new ways.
Industry Association tries to score as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explained through environmental awareness: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable".
Reinhardt added: "This refers to the materials used".
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of applied arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.
To counter the competition from Asia, we must find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
"There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies need to think above all, economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design will often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In doing so, the machine in some places embroiders small beads.
The Plauener goldsmiths champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße was inspired: "Before I could do anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now use the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old", says Reuter.
It provides in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose driving out in Plauen and the surrounding area have lived and who want a souvenir.
So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauen lace.
