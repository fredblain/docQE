Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis-the second half of the season was for the Detroit Tigers, not particularly funny.

The Tigers are reduced to their role as a spoiler, played this part but on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with a 5-4 in the target field.
The twins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wild card spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three-letter F word, which was, so hard to grasp for much of the second half of the season.
"All victories be fun, no matter how it comes," said Tigers manager Brad from Remus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support, as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It's hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and therefore I want to go into it concentrated in the game.
The designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was the first three hit game by Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He has swung the bat well," from MUS said.
He looked good (blow training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it into play.
The twins had their best chance to get back into the game with three runs in the lagging behind at the end of the seventh inning.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double to the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks a reached colorful, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout, before it was replaced by the left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ran over the wall, the only man with whom he was confronted before the designated rookie batsman Miguel Sano, who took a two-run away from the right-handers drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners, and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the major League-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe suggested a double play
At the end of the ninth inning, Detroit added an insurance run, wall made a RBI double against the closer of the Tiger Bruce Rondon and achieved the status of 5-4.
The right-hander stood out from but Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
At the start of the game, Detroit benefited from a non-moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been deleted from the injured list before the game, after he had been missing more than a month because of a back ailment.
"Obviously not the start I wanted", said Hughes, "but I felt more comfortable when I got started and felt that I'd make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning".
After they got the leadoff batter in the first, hushes delivered a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A Two-Out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez in the game, created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 series of successes with the runners in scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single to the right side, made another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game, when he tried to get, which ended the threat to the third.
The Tigers rose in the second, scored a One-Out double by Catcher James McCann and a Two-Out single by center fielder Anthony gose to make it 3-0.
"That was a big blow," said twins manager Paul Molitor.
He has not beaten, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch-count, scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the right-handed reliever A.J.Achter.
Hughes resulted in three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
