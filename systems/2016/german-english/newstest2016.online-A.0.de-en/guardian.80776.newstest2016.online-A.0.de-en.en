Eight golden rules for living in student residences
Eleven years ago, I moved as a young 19 year old in a dorm room, still in the belief in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of that I have - annoyed and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The move into student housing ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It's tempting to talk: tell people where you're from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in terms of CORBYN and why "neither love nor hate, because seriously, guys, it's only a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room Marmite honestly you."
Breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those that you would not speak, even if your lashes were on fire and that fire extinguishers would be.
Let people.
The rooms of people transform venues and communal gathering places often in drinks receptions, movie night, but they are also the places where people get dressed and put her underwear.
This involved: not remember to start at the University with a relationship
Introverts get rough treatment at the University.
Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room to room shopping culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want that our friendship will continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship close by baking.
As you begin the University at the peak of the back-mania, the knock on the doors of people is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s to present with a plate of Brownies, "welcome in the neighborhood, I have you baked something. so, and please smile when I ask you some personal questions."
To offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and will associate your face with a tasty morsel at the end of May.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause that people be sleeping when you knock on the door.
There is a common crime in student dormitories to steal food.
Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but it is also taking a drop of Milchs for tea?
Check with the owner of the milk.
The chances are good that they say to use, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try so balanced to deal as my roommate, who added a detergent to their milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should make no noise, which prevents people from sleep or work.
It is not simply to be a decent person, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people, in the glass house sitting.
A girl in my Hall asked their neighbors, whether it matters you, drum & bass to put something down because it three o'clock in the morning, and she had in the morning a test.
You have responded with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she let her neighbors kindly two hours sleep before she all had their own music, completed her door and went to their three-hour exam.
Would it not romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same dorm?
Conversely, it would be not profoundly embarrassing if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, to make them turn back and see every day have to and perhaps see how she pulls across all mutual friends to?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has leave his keys in his not locked room, the line between a prank and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments until it becomes a boomerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about security - by hiding but never mess up one's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock your door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but not more than twice down staple their possessions on the ceiling.
