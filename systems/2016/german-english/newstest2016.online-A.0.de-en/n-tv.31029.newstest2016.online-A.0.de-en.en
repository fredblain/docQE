Refugees need accommodation: study warns of housing gap
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The battles in the German housing market have started long ago.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU are pushing more and more people on a market which is already overloaded in many major cities.
They compete with low-income citizens to the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, each year, 400,000 new units need to be built by 2020.
This result is a study commissioned by the Association Alliance "Social housing".
To compare: in this year, 260,000 units are finished in Germany.
Thus, 140,000 homes are missing.
Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial recording accommodation after the first three months of their stay.
Many then encounter the housing market and ranks in the long queues in front of the rented accommodation.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, half of all asylum seekers for rent lived less than in the last year.
The negative development of the housing market is not only the rising numbers of refugees.
The study is also significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.
Germany put a housing deficit before him, which is growing from year to year.
Currently, approximately 770,000 units, were missing in the metropolitan areas complains Matthias GÃ¼nther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities inevitably in shared rooms.
Young adults were due to the downturn in the housing market involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama".
In large cities the number of square meters per capita dropped for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance of "Social housing" proposes a reboot.
In doing so, new incentives to stimulate social housing again.
So could the tax be avoided and are exposed to the real estate tax for subsidized apartments limited.
In addition, attractive tax depreciation allowances are necessary according to the Alliance.
The support programme for refugee shelters in the State Bank KfW is now well in cities and towns.
A week after starting more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been called off on Monday evening with 184 million euros already.
Now the project could even be increased.
