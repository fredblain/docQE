Konrad in search of 35,000 Hardy quarters
Konrad has to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used that his word carries weight.
The Government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen bankers to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception centre Traiskirchen has already received Konrad in the handle.
"We have no homeless more in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
Also accommodation of 20,000 refugees of who had come to Austria on Monday, was is without fuss, Konrad said, and praised the "master achievement".
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a "crisis situation".
Overall, Konrad anticipates a requirement of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number 35,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks, 20,000 are to provide the countries, 15,000 of the Federal Government.
Should there be more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a black hole," said Konrad.
With the land captains, he has already held talks.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the refugees.
"It runs fine in Upper Austria," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP agent supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂nborn, it should be clarified, as the Church will help.
The asylum Coordinator in the ORF action "Help as we" has great expectations.
Individuals can easily offer accommodations on the platform.
In addition it is hoped to hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In hard times, it could not be that accommodation providers must comply with a certain amount of the towel rail or size of skylights.
"Emergency standards" would have to apply for a limited period of time.
Konrad established that he was successful in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior in keeping with his experience.
I am an older gentleman, which they say the untruth in the face.
Power of persuasion was his main weapon.
Konrad and Maier cause the Republic no costs, as they themselves said.
They want to increase the number of their employees to three or four.
Own accommodation search was not successful yet.
Konrad wanted to put up a container at Stephansplatz as an Office.
But apparently there are problems with the approval.
Linz demands a better distribution
For the time being, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as you can currently accommodate people without these measures, says mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
For emergency, other locations on their suitability will be examined but.
The city chief at the Division of refugees within the State is critical.
Other districts have to make their contribution.
