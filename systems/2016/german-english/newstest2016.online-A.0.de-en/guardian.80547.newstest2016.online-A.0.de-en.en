Certainly better knows David Cameron The Lorax?
It's one thing soon learn all parents: If your child loves a book, it is not long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked to name his favorite children's book by a provider of childcare systems the Prime Minister chose the Lorax, the 1971 published environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company of SuperCamps, and continues: "funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my kids, because there seems to be a picture or a message that we've been missing."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in the Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead a summary the film version of 2012 reflects, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the walled city Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he met her desire to see a real tree, by", reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, the real name of Theodor Seuss which was hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.
If it still not suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which will be presented on the Web site of Internet movie database and so begins: "In the walled city Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he admits Yes to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book as little familiar is an unnamed boy, like the yarn local environment through the Thneed of money-grubbing, be felled trees, once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, moustached creature "that speaks in the name of the trees", listen here is devastated.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task to a helper has been delegated, not 20 times in a row has read the Lorax a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed but no more immediate comments that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, was.
