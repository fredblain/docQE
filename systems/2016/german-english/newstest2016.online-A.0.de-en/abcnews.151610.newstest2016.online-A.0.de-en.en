UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the nearly five-year conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief Urges all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and to support integrative negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent Member Nations of the Council--United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial session of the General Assembly to meet to discuss the situation in Syria this month.
He regretted that the divisions in the Council, and of the Syrian people and the regional powers "make impossible to solve this situation."
Ban called on the five permanent members, to show the same solidarity and unity showed in achieving a nuclear deal with the Iran in addressing the crisis in Syria.
