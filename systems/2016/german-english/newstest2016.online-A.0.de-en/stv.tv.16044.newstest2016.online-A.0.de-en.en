Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone of the girl, as it slept, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of indecent images of children, sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alerted her mother.
The police cared and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered "concerned" Web searches, the terms for the search for indecent pictures of children used.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it, because it then "pretended to"Paedophiles on the Internet would lead"and he a policeman to be to scare them".
The Prosecutor, Eilidh Robertson said the Dundee Sheriff Court: "he said that it was an addiction, that he was addicted to scare people."
He admitted that were carried out the searches on the computer from it, but said it had happened because he wanted to consider a police officer to be to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his discussions with the unknown person, who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more pictures.
He said that he did it to lure them.
He said he was sick in the head, when he's drinking, and said he wants to see pictures of raping and murder then.
Ms Robertson added: "when the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She saw then the indecent pictures on the phone and thus confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused used computer and PlayStation to talk with girls, who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the indictment to have taken indecent images of children on June 14 last year, to have failed to meet the conditions on 25 January this year and to have appeared not to court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg does not appear in the register of sexual offenders, since it could be argued that there was "no significant sexual element" in his offense to find.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to obtain background reports about social work.
Hogg bail was granted in this case, but was kept due to consultations on other pending cases in pre-trial detention.
It was recorded before the date of the judgment in the register of sexual offenders.
