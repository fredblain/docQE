Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise as criticism according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, rather for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, the as "special KS" is referred to, Montreal was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the masters in the spotlight.
In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee and Harrison cried out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should hit the child."
While he was last seen as he smashed a racket after a spasm of thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in individual Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the United Kingdom.
"One thing about which I quite ereifere, is the fact that I believe Thanasi a little in the dispute was involved," Healy said.
He broke a racket when he lost because of a spasm in the U.S. open, but he is not the first player who broke a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud Thanasi.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think that he has been treated a little too severe.
He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room area, he trained hard, he is in good shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.
Healy supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios, which starts on Friday, for the important preliminaries and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term integral part of the team."
"First we want that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around it [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has risen very quickly, what people like Federer and Murray to have. it goes in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try, some time out of the limelight, in which he only can think, I appropriate, consider him the consequences of his actions to make. and it is best for the team and it's the best for him.
