The head of JD sports says that higher wages will jeopardize the expansion.
The Managing Director of JD sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers" for UK workers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The costs could meet the expansion plans of JD sports, he added, and that could mean that there are less jobs.
