Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses for people who don't have much money in the Middle Franconia corners Valley.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and the low-wage earners."
"I'll show how you can build even today still cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast can create more affordable housing: it builds in a project row houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees are entering the housing market.
What solution do you have?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In view of the refugee flow, we need sufficient living space in the coming decades.
Very simple, three-story townhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, bringing among the people in apartment buildings.
Each of the six houses of that are built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I will go back.
Then, the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro, without land.
This is straightforward.
The construction took six months.
This is appropriate.
Have the building regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: Building regulations, I have carried my project correctly.
Always the impending threat of special construction and parking regulation makes it very complicated.
Creepy.
It is still, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities, the place is missing for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.
How did people react to their row House project?
Gildner: There, who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What definitely is wrong.
But exacerbate not the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: Is true: we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but were built luxury apartments, which hardly any more can afford.
My project has the message, even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-wage earners.
I will show how you can build even today still cheap and good.
That's what.
