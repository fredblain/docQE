How you share your stories, pictures and videos with BBC News
Every day BBC News - on TV, on radio and online - the latest stories from around the world bring you... but what we want to hear are the issues that are important to you.
The role that you play in creating the messages, is very important.
Whether it is news or a theme represented by you, your contribution can make a difference.
Have you seen an event or were you affected?
Is something significant, bizarre or unusual in your environment?
Do you have a story to tell, or there is something that you should follow in your opinion?
There are topics about which you want to set talks underway?
What would you like to comment?
Or you want to find out, talk about what others?
