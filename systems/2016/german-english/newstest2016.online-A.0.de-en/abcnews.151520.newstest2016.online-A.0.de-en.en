Michael j. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "back to the future" was professionally a great moment for Michael j. Fox.
It was for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it I realize little by little, that Princess Diana will sit next to me", he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time".
The film begins, and it comes to me in the sense I am a simulated yawn and an arm's length of them, to be with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in time", a documentary on "back to the future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with Director of Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the future" had 30 years premiere.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "no doubt the greatest time travel movie ever filmed."
"Back in time" will be to see on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
