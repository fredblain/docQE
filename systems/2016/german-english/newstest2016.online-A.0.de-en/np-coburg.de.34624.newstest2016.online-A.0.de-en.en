The free voters demand the recruitment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high numbers of refugees.
Party and leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn exam in Grosswallstadt facing a severe crisis in Bavaria's schools, if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to prevent the collapse of the schools," said Aiwanger.
"Otherwise, we will have distortions in the Bavarian educational system."
The parliamentary group of the free voters will meet until Friday in the lower franconian town of the municipality.
Actually, other main topics were provided.
But the record number of refugees dominated also the free voters meeting.
"Of course the issue of asylum will overlay the exam", said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, just as there was it during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"It cannot go on, we need to address the causes," said head of free voters.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport as soon as possible to the free voters.
For this reason, Aiwanger demanded more staff for the administrative courts, which are responsible for asylum claims: "We need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticised the fact that several States are not consistent: "We need a nationwide uniform standards in the States."
"Bayern deporting, others are not."
"As we need to be effective."
However, should the land policy in Grosswallstadt do not fall under the table.
A long time burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, education minister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) at 47 high schools has the pilot "intermediate plus" started, in which tested an extension of the upper intermediate level from three to four years - as a result, it takes again nine years until graduation.
However, this does not go far enough Aiwanger.
"The theme of G9 must be accelerated," said the head of FW.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to.
Free ride on the G9 everywhere where it is desired.
