BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM, says member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticised the station because of its "dumbing down"
He argues that it is indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only the Brits
Parliament Mr Damien Collins attacked the broadcast of the voice and said that this is not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament, and raises new pressure to the transmitter, to prove that he is doing something the private broadcasters do not.
The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham said also the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and is increasingly no longer indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"Radio 3 seems - I use the word"dislike - idiots"but it seems to turn to Classic FM", he said.
He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which started in last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started in the last year, seem to be the Brits only under a different name.
So if you try something else to do - this two are spontaneously mentioned examples where you imitate only that what is already on the market", said Mr Bingham.
BBC Director - General rejected the allegations and argued that Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors is BBC, when it comes to live music and public education.
What I'm learning from Radio 3 I will nowhere else learn about classical music.
And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.
"And 3, to find new music and to give new works, I think the commitment of radio really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC argued Radio 3 controller Alan Davey that harder work must be done to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British of less about classical music are informed.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that it came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on culture, media and Sport Select to enter the commercial rivals on the feet.
The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show for the BBC, by the Dutch producer Talpa media for an estimated cost of 22 million Â£ was purchased.
See why this program is discussed often, because it's not original and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - was produced with Paloma faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC way".
He added that he hoped that the company "find a hit from our own stable" when it next time start a conversation series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering further rows of the voice in the future or to spend the fee payer for other entertainment formats.
