BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders and the voice send. He said that commercial rivals "her right arm would give" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for that to place public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, highly controversial window against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said, the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC in contact.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends, which would also clearly of non-subsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee within the framework of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the licence fee, which I in the medium or long term not consider a good idea, you should the others not to make its production at least on programs, or Commission.
They send the voice in a prime time, because they want to achieve as broad support for their future.
The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funded programs could be financed without subsidies.
The voice is such a programme, EastEnders is an another, admittedly both in-house productions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I try to see how this is to be public television.
I don't think that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame in the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people of who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments to the BBC's most popular programmes reflect that the former head of sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the rather public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't, measure the audience but they perform their tasks, and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ licence fees go,"well, of course, we have created all of these obscure programs that no one has seen.""
They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see her.
To the licence fee, Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find who can get the best value from it a more regressive system in terms of conditions.
Of course, you all think we all think that one for £150 per year here a great value for the 150 gets, but for people, £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they consume much of the BBC.
The former sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review their Reithian mission "to inform, to make and to entertain".
He said little of the BBC production would be classified officially as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take on the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada an example this change to "inform, educate and entertain".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful of TV shows and with commercial channels enter alliances, to make everything available online.
