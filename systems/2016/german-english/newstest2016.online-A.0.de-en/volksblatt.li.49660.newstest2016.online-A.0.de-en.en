Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Platz
Almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther square in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless place in the Park on Oppio Hill on the name of the German reformer was christened on Wednesday.
On the "Piazza Martin Lutero", he is now recognized as "German theologian of the Reformation".
The Park is right next to the Colosseum in ancient Rome.
The name had been requested by the Association of Evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled Wednesday because the Protestants in the city of the Popes over the centuries as a minority only in secret to be able to live their faith.
With the square will be visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome would be welcomed.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was 1510/11 a few months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk at the turn of the year.
At that time, he felt the city as a depraved Sin Babel.
His negative impressions are likely to have encouraged according to historians in his later fight against Rome.
Luther had initiated the split in the Western church with his theses against the sale of indulgences.
