Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "we do it"
The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What to expect in Germany?
Around 800 000 asylum seekers will be according to projections of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany able to absorb one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination given the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".
The following overview provides what to expect Germany.
Apartments are needed according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) per year - and the next five years.
That's almost twice as much, built as before (250000 apartments).
The lack of housing in affordable rental properties is dramatic: every year 60000 to 80000 social housing from the rent controls fall out, and these discounted apartments will apply for refugees.
Therefore, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing units per year would have to emerge and that the Federal Government would have to invest funding amounting to 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and federal Bauministerin agree, that there should be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be gainfully employed in the long term.
However, the refugees would not systematically criticized asked in Germany after their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is vital if they find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, there has been a change in policy according to Thränhardt: from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was limited, in November 2014 to three months as well as the residence requirement, asylum seekers on a place of residence.
The view has prevailed in society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - the majority, that faster access to the labour market should enable refugees.
Lack knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market.
So far, there is no sufficient offer of General and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.
Networking is the best way to work integration according to Thränhardt.
The Berlin school administration has determined that only a few refugees parents give their children in the day-care centres, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rootless parents, it is only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare center, the Administration distributed handouts in different languages.
Should the need for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about, by allowing more technical schools.
In the countries, students without knowledge of German in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.
You are taught but not always by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers, who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
Them there is no lack of, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no State prohibits the study of asylum seekers or tolerated - Berlin was the only exception so far, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) but gave up his stance.
Access to the University could be facilitated study willing refugees.
For refugees with a residence permit or condoning get no benefits according to the laws, when they start studying.
The latter have basically no student loans, as they fall outside the circle of bafögberechtigten persons.
Tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany in order to be eligible for student loans, so far four years from January 1, 2016 shortened to this margin to 15 months.
This funding gap must be closed but, call noise, Berlin's State Secretary for science, and the German Studentenwerk Steffen.
Students should immediately get student loans.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should gradually the same rights give Islam as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state religions ratio.
The establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who take professional care of the newcomers would be important.
The rights include responsibilities.
Must agree the representatives of Islam on a clear point of contact and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him some control.
This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.
The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflict could be brought to Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited immediately their right to stay, here in Germany," he said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk.
He proposed to translate the basic law in Arabic.
Integration will in the future much more than today to be a theme of the society as a whole.
This is also the majority society must change, the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing.
Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions – for a decade on a tight a federal agency and a general equality law.
But as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive learns very slowly.
Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the non-white German interest groups long demand and why international agreements such as the Convention against racism oblige Germany, must become a reality in the next few years, when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their facilities for the benefit of all.
In General, Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees, medical doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery said.
"We create with regard to man power and capacity,", he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money into the system must flow for it.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls immediately upon registration health cards to hand over all comers.
Services could be charged later with the Federal States.
And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of services, which provides the laws.
Otherwise, above all the language barriers to make the doctors.
Already, so the Berlin health scientist has demonstrated Thea Borde, migrants are worse about their illnesses enlightened than other patients.
Not only in hospitals, including medical practices interpreter costs would have to be taken over, it demands.
Many refugees already with more general focal points in the emergency care would help.
And with another diagnostic view.
There's significantly more untreated disability among refugee children about, and young people is about HIV education.
German doctors from their training would be clear but with different syndromes, says Montgomery.
"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". and with regard to the shortage of doctors, whether the refugees even relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.
In order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualification however, and may again take examinations.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill according to the Federal Chamber of psychotherapist (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explains refugee children, are particularly vulnerable.
A recent study at the TU Munich proves that five Syrian refugee children traumatized is on in Germany.
Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.
Early treatment is necessary, to prevent that the symptoms were chronic, Munz said.
So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services may submit a request for psychotherapy, but does it take for several months to the process.
Also mostly officers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness, would decide in the social services, whether or not treatment is necessary.
This would often lead to misjudgments, says Munz.
