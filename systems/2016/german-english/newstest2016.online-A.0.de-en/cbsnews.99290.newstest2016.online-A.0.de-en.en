Choice 2016: Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton's national poll halved
The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders her gains compared to ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for President, receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters in the primaries.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that your opinion is, which candidate they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these projections have been reduced.
Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has not materialised, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton has, however, a big advantage among older voters.
Last month Clinton before Sanders was with double-digit lead the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.
About half of democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters of her excited.
The views are more mixed for those who do not currently support Clinton--only about a quarter would support enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporters in an open question asks why they want that she is the candidate, is followed by the view that it is time that a woman President is (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent) the most common answer that she has the right experience (16 percent).
Of Clinton's supporters, also their connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent) is mentioned.
Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.
As the Vice President raises a potential for the Presidency in the balance, 57 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it.
When democratic voters in the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, is Biden at the top.
More than half say of Clinton's supporters that Biden would be their second choice well ahead of Sanders.
Biden, decides not to run for the Democratic nomination Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race increases.
Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure of 78 percent has decreased in the last month.
Biden is a second in this measurement by far, but the percentage that "w√§hlbarsten" sees it as the, has increased.
Nevertheless, at the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar as in the last month, not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters to the primaries as unacceptable stands out.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results for some important characteristics among voters of their party primaries.
Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden performs in the three candidates the best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.
Thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the primary elections see also Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
About a quarter of democratic voters in all of these measurements has no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be made Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State, the most democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.
But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.
Now, half of Americans is not satisfied with their explanation, while only about one-third is satisfied.
The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after came the problem to light.
Most Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had even deteriorated.
There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, saying that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton by the voters of their party is considered honest and trustworthy, as this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters view across the country also Trump as dishonest and not trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best with honesty.
A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.
