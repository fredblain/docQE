EU wants to double mercury limit in predators
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and the consumers expect a much higher dose of the case.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which there is a corresponding working document of the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and young children", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
Wolfschmidt according to the limits of the nerve for big fish should be raised at the end of the food chain like about shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" of one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish are contaminated with mercury that 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the force limits about but already today as strong.
After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 percent were not for sale.
In return for this relaxation of the EU according to Foodwatch wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this but "Trick", because smaller coarse, like about carp usually as low charged, that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion, that alone helps the economy", said Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a highly toxic for the human heavy metal which greatly accumulates through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
Therefore the Federal Government warns that "even small amounts especially in unborn damage of the nervous system" can cause.
The Federal Environment Ministry declared on its website in terms of the existing maximum levels, but that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury passes mainly through the coal combustion in the environment.
The German coal-fired plants bear buck more than six tons emit mercury according to a written report of the Federal Ministry of environment to the Green Member of Parliament Anna Lena in the year, two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish around in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded", had quoted in the March from the paper "The mirror".
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
