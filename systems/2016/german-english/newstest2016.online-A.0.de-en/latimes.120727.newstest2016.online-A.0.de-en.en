At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table sitting to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Looming above them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting room a mural of the United States is.
The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.
The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing the US employment and prices here hold.
But since the great recession the Fed acknowledged leaders that there was an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow, it to predict. it is announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most of the data show the economy that she grow steadily, could the recent turmoil in the global financial markets make the already cautious fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point.
"Obviously the labour market and inflation primarily will be, the most important thing what they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed intends to do, what unsettles to itself the financial market.
About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, the financial markets expect a wait for the fed, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance to increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists to soften the blow, they pledge that a further increase is far.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial jumped average by 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the set this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's capital markets research group.
"It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this time", he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they are not panicking."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
The Fed is on track to increase, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month seemed to be a month ago.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expect an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of Liberals, that more economic progress would be required.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level, the view the fed as full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at the Pantheon of macroeconomics.
But the financial markets around the world flashed together late last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell in the may by more than 16% below its all-time high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now is up by almost 10% below the high of May.
For the representatives of the fed, the market turbulence affect the complex calculation when you should raise interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last not occurred few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting", said Stephen D. though, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for real estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Now, he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said though.
None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, therefore she should not involve technically in their decision making.
But in the end the Fed monetary authority of the world has become.
The influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years.
The mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bernanke triggered in 2013, that the Fed "could narrow its monetary expansion", confusion around the globe.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be that they monitor not only the developments elsewhere, but consult with other central banks and experts, to provide a better understanding of the global economy expected by the Fed's representative.
Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements with not seem associated with the economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal open market Committee, de cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example set for an interest rate hike.
A financial crisis in Asia led to the fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States", said Lacker.
A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts back.
The Fed should aspects of financial stability during a major crisis such as the collapse of the market 2008 first put, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee for determining the interest rate the Bank of England.
The recent turmoil will not come close to this level, he said.
"She will not be certainly the situation, in which she is afraid of an increase in interest, because the markets worry", said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for international economics.
The Federal always contains Reserve Act still this double mandate and mentioned the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think that she should be ahead of time.
