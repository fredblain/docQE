The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit Britain from the EU) could win at inlet if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull
David Camerons half-baked renegotiation strategy, to keep Britain in the EU, is with each passing day more deeply get into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "it is Yes or no?" CORBYN, Director of labour or the TUC, which itself fell sharply because of Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is it and not getting out of their own debt, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which most of the time they do not want are fed up.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also doesn't like this, if they endanger the social protection.
We could call it Dave and Georges Selfies agenda.
Prime Minister and Minister of finance climb to the Summit and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, the one for outside lighting UK inside the EU tent wishes - "Let us not only with France", says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted Ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point, where it is they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been 10 years in power and wants to leave the Office before it looks bad for them as it happened with the excessively long waiting out like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and cabbage (16).
France's François hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in the year 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland has a left a nationalist right-wing Government, Spain may soon.
It is difficult to imagine that they will bend over backwards to, to help the Selfies British, whose Energie should be used better for Scotland's exit from the UK to prevent - something they also do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore some such Ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments in the SNP style might plan during Britain's referendum campaign 2017, in order to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory, the fleet can be street at their expense and the oligarchy of the press barons is what EU skeptics, as they in 1975 but were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can contact weak Boris Johnson, remember ore euro opportunists, who has made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.
In all of his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.
This includes the medley of tax have villains, phone hacking aliens and the pseudo belonged to non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought much about it, but found that if you sit down with a hot gorilla in a cage, you spread better bananas to distract him, rather than for his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum back, because Blair had been the principle of the Constitution not adopted the EU, which then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.
The press has never forgiven that.
But the Nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave a friendly Pat on the back to me on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he needed no time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger of Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to attract the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyns official position to Europe – I say time friendly - in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, outside of Ukips traditional blue dye tendency and the Wilder realms of Tory small Engländerismus everyone can say most people Yes.
It is what this week said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television as the Scouts in it struggled not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s, when his father tried on television about to be disloyal to his labour Cabinet colleagues not to go too far and lose his Cabinet job.
Hilarys fight was even more attractive.
To fight, but to stay "in all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell, still what JC told his comrades and members by all accounts at its closed-door meeting on Monday night.
You are thinking what will - give always the sentimental image of bottom-up from CORBYN that he has stirred even me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and above all in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right to give Cameron no free pass for Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said it goes without saying.
Simon Jenkins thinks certainly so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As Tom Watson is rock solid with its ambiguities to NATO - convinced that JC is launching a campaign to exit the - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors in all at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they have also suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British when all this may be pointless?
The United States are already quite disappointed by the poor military performance in the Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting the Tory Government in power, what I was reminded of something at the start on Monday, what British influence security forum called.
