Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months because of double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this cry brought the left fullback and will close it for at least six months of playing, Louis van Gaal hope doesn't give up that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute, after the 20-year-old Shaw in the PSV area was broken up.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture of the leg and is in the hospital."
He will tomorrow or maybe a day later and then surgery in Manchester.
It is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, it has very hard and then fantastic plays, and then this happens.
In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then that lasts for six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of a penalty.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee has not punished the Mexicans.
Van Gaal thought that the Italian referee had made a mistake.
You can judge for yourself if I say that a penalty kick and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet to Shaw's account was: "I thank you for your messages. words cannot describe all of you, I'm as tired, my road to recovery starts now, I will come back stronger."

The England Defender has an added incentive to recover until next June with the European Championships in France.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: "It is a very bad injury."
If a player with that kind of injury leaves the place, all are very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico against van Gaal Holland team at the World Cup 2014.
"It is difficult very because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you then hear that it is a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
For me, it was not possible to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction, so that it looked as if he [Moreno] touched him had, but I could see not the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know, how it feels, I know how hard that can be.
I feel very bad about. so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital, following a challenge by Chris Smalling.
