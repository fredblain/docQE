Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club founded three months ago, "chess friends Bad Kissingen" has recorded another Member in its ranks, thus the number of members increased to 19 players.
The new Member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player, who was in Bad Kissingen to cure more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is winner of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Espelkamp and LÃ¼bbecke.
In Bad Kissingen Gauselmann has supported the chess club with a donation, Chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
Thus, it is possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the Chess Club, and also friendly contact with the Tennis Club "Red-white" is seen as an expression of his attachment to the spa town.
