For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, wrote of an editorial to the new study in JAMA surgery.
Weight loss surgery or weight loss surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.

For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng used general hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI for those receiving non-surgical treatments of diabetes about the same at 29 remained.
Among those undergoing a surgical procedure, the diabetes disease broke up completely and 28% partly at 36%.
In the medical treatment group diabetes fully only at one percent, and with only about two percent was in comparison.
In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "Generally better in the 'surgical' group", found the authors.
The researchers monitored also the patients blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c the best below 7 percent is held, write the researchers.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.
In the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" â€“ as the improved hemoglobin A1c level is reflected in you - not the mortality was reduced in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team compared the average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrectomy Group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden, that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who underwent obesity surgery likely to die about 29 percent - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods in the course of 15 years.
Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival in surgery patients, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.
"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin seriously to take weight, as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think that we can wait too long until we encourage people to take this seriously," she said.
"I think that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes, which have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."
