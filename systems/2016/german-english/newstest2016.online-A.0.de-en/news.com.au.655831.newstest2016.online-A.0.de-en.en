Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there are many other teams that last year requests sent after his impressive open training day end.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench, when he so lost a tussle, the Aussie Rugby League convert did with his first punt-return on Tuesday when the 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula entrusted his man and the next opportunity for a punt return and the running game gave Hayne after injury of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show its true face in the locker room after the game.
Rather than to grind his rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he encouraged them.
Tomsula strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter cam Inman reported that Hayne was encouraged by special teams Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and to take care of the next game.

It was certainly not the start, Hayne and his massive Australian following for his NFL debut had hoped for.
Hayne left the field of play after the fumble cursing and told the Australian radio later duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could imagine a worse start in his NFL career.
"That was a thing that happens now, they only care of the next game, and this is it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Carver with his origin debut back in 2007, when a pass with led to a try for Queensland in his own in-goal area.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27 years yet.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans and keeping an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
