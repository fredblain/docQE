Experts criticize public health England report on E-cigarettes
Allegations of a State-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts who write in the British medical journal (BMJ), joined Lancet by criticizing the of public health England (PHE) used evidence in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE in last month published the "policy report" and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on the PHE founded his main conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have wondered whether the claims "based on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Ã–ffentlichde health at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects, that the claim of PHE, that "The current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, comes this statement from a single session of 12 people, who were called up to be a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (multi criteria decision analysis - MCDA) to develop, to get their opinions on the harm of nicotine-containing products into a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss health, whose Managing Director before should have benefited American tobacco (BAT) of British for an independent study.
He signed the references of the BAT to the public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to get funds from an E-cigarette manufacturers but they added not the financing, he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not included, but include several well-known E cigarettes champions, of which some specify the paper industry funding.
Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
Also the tobacco line of PHE took part in the meeting.
The research of group "admits significantly," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products for most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed.
McKee and Capewell said that were the allegations of PHE, that 'there no evidence so far is that E-cigarettes are used as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers' premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously has been responded to.
He said: "E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison are low, but that we have continued to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform of the public about what evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.
By the clear presentation of current evidence that E-cigarettes without risk are, but represent only a fraction of the damage of that is caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.
