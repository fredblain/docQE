Peter Moody claims that stewards were trying to spy on him and threatens to quit racing
Peter Moody claims that by Racing Victoria stewards have tried in the last year a spy in his stables to install and threatened to quit the race.
He took aim at the stewards and the Health Department of Racing Victoria, claiming that scratching of Lady Tatai for Raceday treatment, the last straw on Wednesday, carrying out a personal campaign against him with the late.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he himself have found even under difficult conditions, when it came to the positive cobalt swab sample at lid ARIS, he cannot explain.
He had held back 18 months because of the spying allegations and did not want that it "look like too high hanging grapes."
"I planned to say anything about it, and I sat long on it, but sometimes they are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went on.
Sometimes, reaction and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will now go home evening and sleep well.
I would like to go around heads, and I want my owners to think that I will try my best for them.
When you start to think, I do not, I should be no more trainers.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Before Moody had let go off the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the Health Department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, sat in a room with a man - whom I'll call when asked - Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do in my stables," Moody said at Racing.com.
Apparently, you believe that I am a cheater.
If that's the case, they should consider themselves certainly on their noses, because they have failed while trying to be brief.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that bring me to the view that it's personal?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and responsible people may make outside of coaches, what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
I am so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think that I am.
Maybe you must take me my license to offend me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now think they can be.
But I am now arrived at the point where it doesn't matter for me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustration levels of trainers have built up with the long-running investigation of cobalt at Lidari, and the late scratching led that he said that he "could throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, described the competition treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse's legs, which violated the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for it", he said.
"One of my employees has applied erroneously mud on the leg.
It could have been last night so.
It could have been all day yesterday so what was the case.
It was so on race day.
Moody could be an investigation into this matter with a three-month disqualification for the treatment facing Pack on race day be. was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules, know nothing about the horse.
"We all understand that we need rules, but here it has gone too far," Moody said.
