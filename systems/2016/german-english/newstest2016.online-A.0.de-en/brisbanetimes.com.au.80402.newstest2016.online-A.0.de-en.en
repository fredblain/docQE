Met cash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi-invasion
Met cash tries to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi March in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler met cash has launched an Bodenständigkeits campaign, the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ to defend Aldi invasion.
While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers met cash and IGA supermarkets and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media, through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Samir from Dunsborough samples distributed in IGA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
It is expected that met cash released more details of its defense strategy on 29 September, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol, and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day.
There is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met cash's IGA stores and IGA network in the Eastern States to generate higher profit margins than met cash's.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia, and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to 14 percent in the Eastern States.
However, believe analysts like Morgan Stanley that Aldi twelve months after opening its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two States will snatch and all existing actors, but mostly independent retailers sales will take away.
According to a report published this week estimated the analyst Tom Kierath by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million sales per year and met cash 250 million $ could lose by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in United States and 30 in WA and a turnover of 500 million $ 600 million and $ will achieve in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities to met cash's high fixed cost base could met cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax costs, said Mr. Kierath.
At the same time, met cash loses market share in the Eastern States, to Aldi and Cole's, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley assumes that sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent will be met cash in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan financial group, at a business lunch in Melbourne, told that met cash will likely disappear within a decade. met cash.
Met cash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr. Douglass.
But it is assumed that a Board member of met cash last week has made contact with Mr. Douglass.
IGAs market share has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from met cash's food and food trade, which supplies 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen since 2012 by 43%, reflecting operational debt reduction for simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins.
The wholesaler resists, however, and invested more than 150 million $, to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to provide a better variety of private-label foods.
Met cash's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading clean-ups to Elan will grow and hopes that the wholesalers will return again in the year 2017 for the first time in four years to profit growth.
