Delicate folk of Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.
The audience, about 40 people, is nearly taken from Stevens lecture.
He told through various places that he repeatedly draws on the map, what report his minute and delicately arranged songs.
Where they originated and how it looks there, in his home.
Since then is wonderfully creative madman Stevens.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can Nestle harmoniously very close to American folk music in the late sixties, but drift in the great opulent appear wise.
It is the rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a swashbuckling series: each of the 50 U.S. States should be sung in a row.
But in 2004, and near the river is already published "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens here occurs.
Live guitar and banjo meet him.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: come on feel the Illinoise") a widely acclaimed masterpiece appears in 2005.
Epic of ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album entered the American Billboard charts and lacking in any year ranking of influential music media.
After prolific experiments uses Stevens then on "The age of ADF" (2010) very extensive electronic pieces.
This sixth regular Studio album is still more broadly orchestrated, but programmed sequences of beats and playing with all kinds of effect and reverb.
Long ago the smaller clubs emerged from, here are the shows to the colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent BÃ¼hnendeko.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring as part of a five-member band from Germany.
In the dark Hamburg!
He presented mainly the available since March "Carrie & Lowell" theater.
Although here now almost 2000 guests sit transfixed in their chairs, the much more mature made Stevens back to the intimacy and the folk returns.
Without a Word to the audience, the Group of excellent musicians through the wide-rich album plays out.
From the audience can be heard: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus the "Plate basically throw away".
Only modestly thanked Stevens to an Encore, plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
