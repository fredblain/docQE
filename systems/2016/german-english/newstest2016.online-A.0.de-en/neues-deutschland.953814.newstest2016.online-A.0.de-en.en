The upper Bavarian town is Ramsau bei Berchtesgaden Germany's first "mountain village".
From the hand of the Vice President at the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Eric kitten, the village of 1800 inhabitants in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award on Wednesday for sustainable tourism.
In Austria, there are already 20 "mountaineering villages".
The local Alpine Association for the award is responsible in the neighbouring country.
A "mountain village" may have no more than 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
