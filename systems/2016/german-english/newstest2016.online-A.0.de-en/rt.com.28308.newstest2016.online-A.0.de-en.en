"Children are the increase in these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a dare in social media.
YouTube videos show how young people drinking disinfectant only because a cheap experience.
Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with benzene mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be lured by attractive aromas of disinfectant.
"A child doesn't think that this is bad for it," Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are scented.
There are disinfectant with Strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.
Disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Particularly in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the poison emergency call center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas, the Fox 4 in Kansa city.
So, you would leave no SIP whisky standing around, but people let this hand disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come in, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year girl who recently had taken four splashes of after Strawberry scented disinfectant in the school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which applies in an adult by law as a drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate hospital for children for signs of brain injury, because it had fallen girls by alcohol and himself had bumped his head, Ritchey said.
"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.
It could be fatal for my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store disinfectants out of reach of the child.
