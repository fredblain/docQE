'Shot in Joburg': homeless young people to photographers trained
Johannesburg City Centre is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and to earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was in Joburg ge(er-)schossen) is a non-profit Studio that teaches homeless young people in how they take photos of their environment and make a profit out of it.)
BBC News has taken one of the first graduates of the project.
