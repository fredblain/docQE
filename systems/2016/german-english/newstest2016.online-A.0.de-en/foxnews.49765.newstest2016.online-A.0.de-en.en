Death shot at Delta State University left letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before he shot his colleagues later in the day and killed - Shannon lamb wrote a note, to say that "sorry do him" at the first murder and wanted "he could undo it," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that called lamb, Professor of geography and social science education at the Delta State University, the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning
and said he had shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb said the staff of the emergency that the police had to send police officers to his home.
"I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "cute dog" in the House is, but "will disturb no one", but will be probably excited, he said.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police came onto the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from lamb, 45, said: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me".
After writing the note, lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a Professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police officers surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday, lamb allegedly believed that Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "love triangle".
Prentiss was of Shawn O'Mara Steen, who stated that they were married for about seven years, described as a "good person".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O' Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter, who is 19, and she was "devastated".
He said that Prentiss were her daughter of "best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, which was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named lightning, met for about three years with lamb.
"She wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he will not go to jail".
When police officers brought him on Highway 1 near the town of Greenville later in that night, drove his car to the side of lamb, fled on foot, ran into the Woods and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate in 2015 from Delta State University, as his Lebenslau on the website indicating University.
