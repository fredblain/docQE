EU Commission proposes new Court in dispute over TTIP
The European Commission proposed a major reform of the current system of arbitration to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.
The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and States should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system corresponding to more traditional dishes in its functioning.
"We want to establish a system that citizens trust", said the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
Sweden intends to present the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.
The German Government announced support.
TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.
The plans to reform of the current arbitration specifically provide that the EU and the United States select together independent judges for a new investment Court.
Equally, they should come from the EU, the United States and from third countries.
Also a second instance is provided for the first time.
It would allow it to appeal against judgments.
So far, the parties agreed among themselves on referees, there was not an appeal against their sentences.
In the discussion of the last few months had become clear, that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström said.
In the long term, she wants to work out according to an international investment Court.
There, for example disputes between Chinese and EU States then could be sorted out.
The investor-State arbitration required by large corporations (ISDS) are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.
The traditional arbitration can be as a form of parallel justice criticized about the companies at the expense of taxpayers make compensation, national laws nullify or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards of opponents.
In first opinions, TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
It was criticized in particular that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission take into account in the reform of key points, which have developed with other EU trade ministers Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table.
The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned to limit the legal remedies available to the economy through too many new rules.
Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged as a result, it was said.
When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (transatlantic trade and investment partnership) can be completed, remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations since mid-2013.
The subject of investor protection was, however, not discussed so far with the United States.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be the end of this year.
This date is considered to be no longer tenable.
