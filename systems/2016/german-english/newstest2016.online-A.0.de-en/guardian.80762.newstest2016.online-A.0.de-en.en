Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
The ads embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International anti-weapons trade shows video.
Terrible killer drones!
Leg cuffs zerschmetternde ankle!
Cluster bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause excruciating pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon pictures leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest arms fair is a combative parody, produced by Amnesty International, to bring the British Government into the spotlight, to sell arms to repressive regimes on the defence and security equipment international Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

But a separate campaign leads also to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains and requiring a second look.
"Important announcement: drive from 15 to 18 September with the DLR?" (Docklands Light Railway) read the London underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which transforms into the image of a tank in the fonts.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers with the DLR will drive... customers will be asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of cruel designs in Banksy's Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped in the distribution in London and used "ad space hack packs", a 6 lb pack of Allen, of which it is claimed that "one third of the bus stops advertising spaces on the planet gain access to around."
Transport for London is not amused this Plakatier-"Vandalism".
One of the parody ads, which was produced by special patrol group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, will be critical to artists and try to bring political work outside galleries to the public.
Many artists make themselves with activists within protest movements to work and realize that after out there in the real world have to go so that her art has an influence on the society.
Another of the anti-trafficking posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, a non-profit working with the graphic designer and voiceover artist who works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt lever was amazed by the silence that prevailed - with a blank space of the ExCeL calendar - the advertising of the arms fair and thought: "we give them the campaign, trying to avoid them."
They played with the invention of a more realistic dodgy advertising but "by the Bluing with bright colors and animation it sticks more."
"You have done a fantastic job helping us to raise awareness on the sale of illegal torture devices at the show," says Tom Davies of amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices not on our doorstep are traded illegally.
Perhaps the most creative art around the arms fair comes from within Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order of the U.S. Army on "the AT4CS fired from the shoulder RS."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead, which delivers outstanding Nachwirkungs effects on the inside of the target."
What does that, it will be uncomfortable.
