FriendsFest: the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male
The absence of similar appearances in shows is obvious, especially in noting how the need for men to open up, has become now more desperate than ever, how to prove suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to tackle the problem, the campaign against living miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to put culture in question prevents the men to seek help when they need it.
Friendship is the heart in the fight to address this challenge.
A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends cut in half the risk of mental health problems.
But of course you must first of all have friends make a friendship work.
In the age of communication through social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, although in reality dominated the isolation.
This superficial success is dominated by the, what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper effect on our mental health.
And a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money can't buy really good luck.
The nice thing about friends was that this focus on the head was placed.
Each character is defined by his work, but because of his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men may relate to in any case, to explore their feelings even if they often hold back completely.
As an employee of the telephone emergency service explained it to me:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal, really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying "I get along this" has a tremendous effect, such as the fact that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems."
Friends is one of the shows of that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of male.
So my objective outsider status over the phone also may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the scenery completely redesigned to celebrate this weekend, then why take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see sitting around someone alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference could make your friendship.
Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
