Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will to see how a man is put to death.
When it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator Gallery in the death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day neared, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications than places available, a macabre Lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Who is selected, which will monitor it emotionless.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossips close friend, with whom I developed my own relationship in the months with phone calls and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh often much when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I may be not a witness and a journalist, so it will be me not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen, to record what I see.
I must just try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, to give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "would have to put better it", but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can at any time remove me from his list of witnesses.
But he wants that an international reporter is present there to write.
When he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim portraits ware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you hear the series of podcasts that I made.
I will not turn on all the details.
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions would make him guilty for the murder of Barry Van Treese to be a beneficiary of the Act.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty not of murder.
I sure think that there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters, which you can use for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
