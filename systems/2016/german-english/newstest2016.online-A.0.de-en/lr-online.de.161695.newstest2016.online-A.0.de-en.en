Hoyerswerda: Life help for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
To give them a warm welcome, is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, there a number of people who unselfishly support asylum seekers in the city.
Petra and Klaus Heine belong to them.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
With its 74 Lenzen, she still teaches.
Every Thursday she does in the asylum-seekers home on the Dillinger Street.
There, it helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is completely different teaching than in a real school.
