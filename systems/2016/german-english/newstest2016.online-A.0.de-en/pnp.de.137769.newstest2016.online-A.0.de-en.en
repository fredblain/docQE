Twin young gorillas at the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo welcomes young with his gorillas.
The 26 year-old Dian brought twins to the world yesterday.
Twins are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German Zoo almost 50 years ago and was in 1967 in Frankfurt, says the Zoo.
The sex of the newborn Gorilla twins stand firm yet not as mother Dian holds it so far tight to the body.
First, the "image" had reported.
