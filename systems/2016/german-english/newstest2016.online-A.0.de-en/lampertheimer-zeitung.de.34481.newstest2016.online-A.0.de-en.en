Ecumenical Hospice help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheim parade ground busy.
People do their errands, some quick steps, sometimes cozy corporations.
You control the two stations of the Mannheim car show at the Paradeplatz.
Keep light rail vehicles.
Plump, vibrant life in a beautiful autumn sunshine and in the midst of four large panels with the heading "Before I die I want"...
The Ecumenical Hospice help made this action on its 20th anniversary, and is entirely faced with mixed reactions.
"It comes to life, so we went with the action in the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice help is the passers-by as well for questions and discussions as the volunteers.
While many a passer-by spontaneously to the chalk attacks and "can read the sentence"Conceive my life",", "drive the camper through the United States", "Stop the war" or "long suffering" supplements, others stop short, read, say phrases like "I'm not yet so far" and then move on.
Again, small discussions about the action itself, about life, dealing with the dying develop at the edge.
Also Peter HÃ¼binger is just.
"Only if I clear do that for me the end of the world comes, I can responsibly live", says the Director of the diaconal work of Mannheim, Germany, which holds the Ecumenical Hospice help together with the Caritas.
Therefore, this high-profile action to the 20-year was good.
That not everyone on the boards publicly to share with, but understandable, after all it was a very personal thing.
The subject of death and dying was fraught with taboos, still so the experience of Josephine Lammer, even if just the hospice movement have enhanced in recent years, that people will be open.
An assessment of the Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and funeral attendant is one of the volunteers in the first hour.
Issues faced by personal experience, she read a lot of literature, and decided to engage in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice help by calling volunteers, she signed up immediately and was at the Foundation in 1995 in.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men--accompanied the affected and members in households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospice of Saint Vincent.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can deal well with their job and the experience gained from this experience.
"I see life from a different perspective, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
Offer of outpatient Ecumenical hospice service is free and independent denomination.
The financial support of the health insurance funds and donations from family members and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of death and grief Companion.
Training for new employees are offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
There, other personal wishes on postcards can be recorded.
