FedEx earnings mixed, reduced financial Outlook for 2016
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit Outlook over a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said a profit between $10.40 and $10,90 making in the fiscal year that ends next may, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting, according to a survey by FactSet $10,84.
The lower view comes despite the price increases, which on average amount to 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that are collected from November.
The company said that it still expected earnings compared with the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenues and growth in online trading will increase.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade into account".
The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million $, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve of Zacks investment research, surveyed analysts predicted.
Sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion $.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected 12,23 billion $.
FedEx has recorded a decline in the international priority shipping, which brought revenue in its express unit to stagnate in recent years.
But the boom in online shopping has increased the results with FedEx ground.
In the last quarter, sales at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating profit was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and auto insurance basically.
The express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings due to higher labour costs in the freight business fell.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.
On Tuesday, they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
