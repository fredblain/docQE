'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sport climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero was the first athlete, who won the American Ninja warrior on Monday night and the big prize of 1 million $ took home.
The competition show, which completed its 7th season, had never seen a competition participant, was able to complete all stages of its obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten made it to the final.
A 75-foot-long rope climbing was one of the last task in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within the time, he was the first athlete who finished the strenuous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior completed. However, Caldiero this challenge full three seconds faster, what the winner made him.
Caldiero talked to E! news after the hard-fought victory, still reeling from the shock of winning the Grand Prize of 1 million $.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I have never more than $10,000 earned or had to life", Isaac said E! over his pile of money.
So all of a sudden... as I can not even imagine, how that is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat down reporters with the Hollywood, to discuss the final and why Britten, although he finished first at all the course, is not just any prize money.
The money the fastest person goes to according to the rules.
"If there is more than one finalist who gets it with the fastest time", said weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life changes, he receives the great bonus.
I don't think that he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
Masses of awards he received from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family man.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me: "If I should be beaten by someone, I'm glad that it is Isaac."
And I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had reversed the roles.
America Ninja warrior was renewed for an eighth season, filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
