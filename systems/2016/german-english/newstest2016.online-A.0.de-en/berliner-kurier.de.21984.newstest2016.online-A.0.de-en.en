Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Only 21 years young, a Linnet with upper chic frise.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is EUR 100 million.
Even more.
There is currently a Monsieur Bieber in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 go crazy.
As Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15 years has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Yesterday, hundreds of fans accompanied Justin.
Among them, Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 am, but the Polish is sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
Bieber construction: Here lives their idol, whose poster hanging abound in Szczecin, since Monday night.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives, costs the day deserves just as much as her Mama Ewa in the half-year.
If at all.
The says: "Actually, my Wiktoria in tenth grade in high school would have to sit."
"I fulfill a dream".
Compulsory education?
Who itches's?
The fans don't.
Also Bieber itself does not.
He has already set for life.
For advertising in the commercial break of the first, he took three million, a two-year deal with a pimple company washed many, many dollars on the Bieber account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber also.
When Justin Bieber drink a cup of coffee, one marvels at the window pane.
He should have captured so more than 100 million.
Some say that the hype would go too far.
Others stress Bieber is finally in the United States and the United Kingdom with his new single "What do you mean?" at # 1.
The many zeros don't care about Bieber himself, whose fourth album released to follow in November, for the first time.
At least he does so.
