The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place where the residents are called show-offs.
This property combines some with the billionaire, who wants to become President.
Donald Trump (69) is good for excitement.
Whether he expressed xenophobic, male goes to journalists or revealed knowledge gaps in the international policy of the crisis – the candidates for the Office of the US President vigorously stirs up the election campaign.
And good cuts.
That is registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire grandparents come from.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-producing village on the wine route.
Some on-site 1200 inhabitants is over many corners with it is related.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt, Germany: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.
The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do think the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?
"I think the find this somehow exciting, are but not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way", says Simone Wendel.
The native Kallstädterin has turned an amusing documentary about the village and its famous offspring, which trump even the ketchup-Heinz family counts.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" to speak - so with the statement that he would be surely successful if he lived in Kallstadt (2014).
He has not placed it to the King of hearts.
Although there was respect for the achievements of the family, but also tend to be the thought that Trump was "already a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.
Coincidentally the nickname noisy, the Kallstadt in the vicinity, "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: she says the blowhard.
Trump is from the village of show-offs.
The Trump'sche success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.
First land purchases in New York were a cornerstone of the real estate company.
But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: your desire to return permanently to the home, failed due to the Bavarian State, to which the Palatinate then belonged.
He had not included Trump because he was once left without permission, said the Director of the Institute of Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, to the film's release.
Trump was the grandson of "illegal immigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"So as the rumbles, it is not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of trumps ("grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").
The winemaker in retirement sees rather distant from the Americans, "he is always so short-tempered".
Does he believe that Trump come?
"I can not imagine that", says the 72.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
The boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm as some Kallstadter mentioned that a descendant of the family Heinz when visiting donated something for the church organ, which was generally well received.
"I can not imagine that of the Donald" says the 68.
It would be better if he could not win the election, because "has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".
If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, would have been so like him, "he would have never reached".
"There are more interesting subjects than him," says Winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President is not Yes" she says.
And: "The grapes are ripe without the Trump of President of".
12 000 filmgoers have seen Wendel movie for the Trump was interviewed long, also in the United States, the interest awakened.
