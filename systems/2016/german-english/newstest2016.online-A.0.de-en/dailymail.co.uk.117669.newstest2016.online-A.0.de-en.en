It is claimed that British people put down their hammers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who do the work in their homes,
If you can skillfully handle with a hammer or a brush to paint from walls, they now apparently belong to a minority.
As Britons increasingly employ craftsmen, to carry out home improvement jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B & Q.
VÃ©ronique Laury, new Managing Director of Kingfisher, who owns the chain of hardware stores, said that a large increase in which number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, provide services at low prices to be outdated now.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops intended for craftsmen and to close 60 outlets from B & Q.
Mrs Laury said she wanted to employ more women in B & Q stores, eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
Men predominate among employees at the moment.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said: "there is still a majority of men in our stores.
We need to move this towards a balance.
Basically half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of British in the FTSE100 index is leading companies, has also its top team umstruktiert to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied with women exactly 50 percent of the team, including its management and Chief Financial Officer.
Mrs. Laury said: "this was a deliberate choice - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the Group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B & Q will open 200 new stores.
