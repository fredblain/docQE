Time of the decision on interest rates on the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching when the Fed meets in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision, whether the interest rates are raised for the first time for nearly a decade.
A survey among 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half, the only last week of the view was that the Fed will do so, now think that the Fed will remain longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.25 per cent will keep.
It is a historic event because it is seven years since the Fed interest rates to zero.
"We approach a situation in which a large Central Bank may leave the zero-field and starts a process of normalisation of interest rates for the first time", said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for international economics.
The US economy is at a relatively high level of performance, trillions of dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generating only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy Outlook on global conditions.
She has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the indications are that the odds are against such a move are good.
The decision is to be announced on Thursday at 20:00 CET
