Here are the report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson CAVANI held course, as Paris Saint-Germain its Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö in the Parc des Princes Stadium started on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when CAVANI scored a header in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs as they strive not only qualifying for the knockout rounds, a strong start against the Swedish master, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal he was later in the game against his hometown team and the Club, with whom he already began his illustrious career in 1999, replaced.
"It's not easy, at home or abroad in the Champions League to win. so it is a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and relaxed look back, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season," Blanc said.
"That's a good sign.
"We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have scored one or two more goals."
Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team held a 2-2 draw on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend, but he was cut out by di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was known as the man can take the PSG to the next level in Europe, when he in the last month from Manchester United was taken over, and he hinted why, when he in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmo defense ran into it before finishing at Johan Wiland along nicely in the corner of the net.
If, however, someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, was disappointed.
Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, participated in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a difficult opponent lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, Trapps post passed to Kevin in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead PSG was on himself sometimes, with some wayward and bad accounts, not least by Ibrahimovic which Championship no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after CAVANI had used it after the restart.
Nevertheless he proved much more skill, when he brought his team-mates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, the Di Maria is transformed into a ball, which past directed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...
The second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to CAVANI. the Uruguayans scored his sixth goal of the season so, after Ibrahimovic had fished on a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only excellent intervention of Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the end result, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a gate at the end.
The coach of Malmö, age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegians said: "our last Champions League was game in December last year.
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which has the same level of.
The qualifiers are not sufficient".
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
