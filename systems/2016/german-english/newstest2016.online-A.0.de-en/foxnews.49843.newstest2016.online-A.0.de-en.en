Stars who have lost their lucky charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor is also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
Sure, all this takes its toll.
