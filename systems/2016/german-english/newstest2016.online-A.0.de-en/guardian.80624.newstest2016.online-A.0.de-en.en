'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they have the frequencies too high for the human ear to be heard, are irradiated with pulses of sound.
The pulses work by the switching of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.

The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, can be used with ultrasound to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Nematodes do not respond normally to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did, when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves effect on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels are called and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report in nature communications.
To create ultrasound-controlled nematode, Chalasani changed genetically so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels carry the worms.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves through the micro bubbles are transmitted more and the worms where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and turn it off.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light that must be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain can low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through unhindered tissue and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
