Adam Lyth was threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Is a difficult task to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but when you see the squad, England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.
I would not rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook's side is less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, only a teen positive attitude.
Moeen Ali developed as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid with the ball, even if it is an unknown quantity at the test level, is an option for the attack.
News related to this: Adam Lyth withdraws from the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to let Adam Lyth, is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, hard to parse.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players on results are aligned.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led players to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - are their own best selector.
Long ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach of Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark, is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to home and away.
The only charge that you can charge was that England was Jonathan Trott set in in the Caribbean â€“ first as a Lyth in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man, I value a.
He is an X factor cricketer, what we early saw at Yorkshire this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent bridge place, what really hit us.
It must have at least the same opportunities as those ahead of him, but of course this depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea, hitting Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four Quicks, appeared, and I don't mind.
I don't see why a batsman there can not do, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a devil of a fellow of cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
He joined as an opener in 2001, my former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop.
He has managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man.
People might see his stats on - average 31 with the bat and the ball 35 - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup kooks who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a couple of clever additions with the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes, new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the messages in accordance with the above.
Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben is not used Stokes, in the one-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.
Although some will not agree, but coaches and team operators determine not the schedule.
And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are made not light hearted.
