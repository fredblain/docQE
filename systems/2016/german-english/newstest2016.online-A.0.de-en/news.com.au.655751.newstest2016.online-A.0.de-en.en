Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite the attempts of nine to take over the loss of the leadership on the today show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra, to report in the following the loss of the leadership of the Liberals, but it has provided no major shifts in assessments for today.
The Technicoloured of nine was broadcast from the federal capital, as Malcolm Turnbull made the fall of Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, stuck in London, Dubai, New York, Niagara falls as part of a week-long series of international television broadcasts, including and belonged to Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance seemed no role to play, as Sunrise scored an average 397.000 spectators at the five capitals in comparison today 339.000 for Australian TV viewers.
Today achieved a slight increase compared with the ratings for Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000), but his number was behind the last Thursday (343.000).
Today, in the last few months, has closed the gap to sunrise.
In August, today reached an average 318,000 compared to the 330,000 of sunrise.
At the beginning of the year was the distance between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is at average 349.000 spectators to 314.000 today.
This is the most interesting thing happens every morning.
The winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament.
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the review!

The big news for seven the impressive debut of 800 words with the former star of series of packed to the rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson is a hit show solo without the rafters star Rebecca Gibney could carry.
The result of last night responded to this with a clear "Yes".
The X-factor of seven remained strong with 1.136 million viewers and beat the block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000) easily.
Seven had mixed results on night two of the Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) the new quiz show, O'Keefe hosted by Andrew revealed 446,000 viewers on average.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623.000 spectators â€“ enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuires hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of the Chase Australia reached 520,000 viewers and whopping in the second half hour 720,000.
Hot-seat average of 620,000.
The decrease in the odds of the second evening of the Chase Australia will give nine confidence that hot seat will eventually prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia minute which failed to outperform the McGuires show is a replacement for million dollars.
