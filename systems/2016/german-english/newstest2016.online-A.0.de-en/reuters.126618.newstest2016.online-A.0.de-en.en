Google launches doubling donations campaign to 11 million $ for refugees to collect
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) a doubling donations campaign announced that the 11 million $ to muster for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overrun the European Nations as they flee from the war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on his blog.
Rather than a Manager make the announcement, wrote Rita Masoud, a Google employee who has fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, about their personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family look desperately for help.
The donations go to four charitable organizations, the aid to refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, save the children and the UN High Commissioner for refugees.
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief to 11 million $ be doubled.
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the second world war, more than 4 million people have displaced in this year largely due to the four-year civil war in Syria.
Many seek refuge from the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.
