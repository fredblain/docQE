Who smokes, has a higher risk of losing teeth
Who smokes, is damaging not only the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.
The good news: In absence of the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early.
This is from the long-term study by an international research team out, including several employees of the German Institute for nutritional research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, the risk to lose their teeth, the higher 2.5 to 3.6 was in smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
Main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For these periodontal disease, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The relationship between tooth loss and smoking go back to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
Is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay.
People who stopped smoking might reduce their risk but within a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of dental research".
However, it could take over a decade, until the danger again sink to the level of non-smokers, first author, said Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
You have to convince people to become non-smokers, said Director Heiner Boeing of the DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life time."
Not to smoke is good for the lungs and blood vessels and leads to our findings to good dental health in old age.
In Germany, over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of loss of teeth are affected, the DIfE said.
Previous research had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study say the findings.
