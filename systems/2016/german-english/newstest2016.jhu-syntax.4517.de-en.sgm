<seg id="2">Some brands have tried to fire him as Flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a collapse.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to draw from the upper echelons in polls down Donald Trump, it has not (yet) works.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the double digit range, and some are beginning to seriously ask themselves, what it means for the chances of the nomination of real estate Moguls.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the term.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that has been made at this time in the year 2011 Rick Perrys led to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won only one state in the nominating process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative group Club for Growth now recognize Trumps by holding assets and begin to make their dollars go to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some current poll ratings suggest that the real estate Mogul is not just a temporary phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumps popularity ratings have rotated 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Shortly before the Real Estate Mogul Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw positive.</seg>
<seg id="15">Until the middle of July, there were 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the beginning of August, there were 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Six in 10 Republicans now have a positive opinion of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three in ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And those numbers keep in early states.</seg>
<seg id="20">A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two thirds of the GOP electorate GOP would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a poll by CNN / ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "enthusiastic" or "pleased" if Trump were nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the nominee.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they are "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with just 21 percent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters that they would be "dissatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment would say to the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans see Trumps temperament is not a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticised for its BOMBA tables and beleidigenden statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tendiere to the Republicans believe that the Estate Mogul have the right temperament for a president, ABC News / Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is the first state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same prefix 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a Oberbefehlshaber according to Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, 44 per cent think that they do not have the personality to run his office effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say that his temperament is not passe to the White House, ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">If they put their scholars hats, Trump Republican voters believe to be real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a poll by CNN / ORC, say four out of ten from the last week that Trump is the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters had not the klarste Kristall ball in the past.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time last cycle to four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination only 28% for the final candidates, Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, Trumps campaign shows that a large number of GOP voters see as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans collected another candidate, Trump beats almost every.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the zersplitterte field likely contributes to Trumps leadership, while the support Trump is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="41">A Monmouth University poll in early September, however, shows that the majority of support in a head to head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump hypothetischen reap.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has 33 points ahead of Carly Fiorina 13 points ahead, with 14 points, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is a head to head race with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the hypothetischen entrepreneurs with 19 points in a head to head race.</seg>
<seg id="46">A knappe majority of Donald Trump fans says that they have formed their opinion.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new poll by CBS / NYT on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump, say that they have given their votes.</seg>
<seg id="48">Much can be done to change that, and no one can really say, of course, to never change the opinion.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">Yet Trumps strongest competition at the moment is the other outsider, the neuro surgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions are twice as often for Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since Donald Trump in his campaign speech two months ago called immigrants from Mexico as "rapists" immigration was Dreh- und Angelpunkt in public discourse to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the BOMB Asti che expression of Trump will hold crucial Hispanic Americans out of the Republican Party and will damage the Neuorientierungs effort.</seg>
<seg id="54">But according to the new ABC / Post poll on Monday that six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.</seg>
<seg id="55">As long as so verbleibt Rampenlicht immigration, it is apparently also do Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">Frustration with the government klettert to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">Donald Trump and Ben Carson is now roughly half the support of Republican voters, especially through their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">Six in 10 Republicans say they want a political outsider, rather than someone with experience of government in the new Montags poll by ABC / Post.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, angered by "Howlin" dissatisfied "with 54 percent and 21 percent."</seg>

<seg id="9">MR Corbyns decision not to sing the national anthem, has drawn attention to himself</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "been in respect of silence" and he had recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC News Two night program that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>

<seg id="2">Metcash is trying to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food Großhändler Metcash has a Bodenständigkeits campaign launched to defend the market share of the IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia prepared early next year to strengthen its relationship with local food suppliers and IGA Sozialen by marketing and marketing on the mainstream media to build the brand, as well as events such as Metcash and IGA Supermärkte Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Eishersteller Simmo DUNS Borough distributed in IGA stores samples and shop owners verbilligte treue customers sell tickets for the South Australian Football League.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that if the Großhändler on food, alcohol and equipment conducts its annual investor Strategietag Metcash released more details of its defence strategy on September 29.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcashs IGA store transactions and generate higher profit margins than Metcashs IGA network in Oststaaten.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a far greater share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia Oststaaten compared to about 14 percent.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi is twelve months after opening its first markets wegschnappen around five per cent of the grocery market in these two states and all existing players, but mainly selbständigen individual traders wegnehmen sales.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report published this week estimated by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath, Metcash and IGA retailers $360 million in sales per year could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and WA in 30 next year and $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocery business and at amounts based on Metcashs high Fixkosten Metcash could cost around $13 million of earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time loses Metcash Oststaaten Marktanteile, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a survey recently conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA shoppers are the most faithful.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley notes that Metcashs sales will fall in food and grocery business by 3.8 percent in the year 2016, at 4.1 percent in the year 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10,3% by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Doug estate, told the founder of Magellan Financial Group, with a Geschäftsessen in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a Jahrzehnts. Metcash.</seg>
<seg id="16">Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr. Doug estate.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a member of Metcash has included contact with Mr. Doug approved last week.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAS share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcashs food and food trade, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43% since 2012, which reflects the operational debt reduction in gleichzeitigem pressure on sales and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, the Großhändler refuses and invested more than $150 million in sales prices anzugleichen hundreds of products each week with Coles and Woolworths, IGA to improve individual traders in the improvement of their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods.</seg>

<seg id="6">While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet zerschlug, after a Krampf vereitelte a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis Healy steadfastly defended.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing that I was, in my view, is the fact that Thanasi hineingezogen ereifere me quite a bit in the dispute," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player Thanasi has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of it.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behave extremely well in the US Open, even under the circumstances pretty provokativen with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around themselves, and I believe that he was treated a bit too strict.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleide areas, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own Verdiensten ausgereifter.</seg>

<seg id="1">Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national poll, halved</seg>
<seg id="2">Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground against her.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primaries now) (58 percent), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (previously increased by 17 percent.</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is standing for the presidency, receives support from 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most Democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's Unterstützer are consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll has Clinton lost on a number of demographic groups, while Sanders posted some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a large lead among women and Gemäßigten, but these Vorsprünge have decreased.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support among men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is here only by 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has verflüchtigt, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton still has a big lead among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month was Clinton, Sanders, with two adjustable lead for the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5 point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter of them would support with some Vorbehalten and another 15 percent, they would only support because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support it.</seg>
<seg id="16">Perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current Unterstützer are particularly excited by it.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter of them would enthusiastically support.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's Unterstützer will be asked in an open question as to why they want that she is the candidate, the most common answer is that it has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time that a woman will be President (13 percent) and that it is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">From Clinton's supporters also mentions her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).</seg>
<seg id="21">Approval for dealing with the problems and the wählbar are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the vice president raises a potential for the presidency in the Waagschale, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like to see him in the race - even though a third believed that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">If Democratic primary voters are asked who would be their second choice party, Biden is at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">Far more than half of Clinton's supporters say that Biden would be their second choice Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, increases of 20 points with Biden in Wettlauf on 30 points without him in the race.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fünfundfünfzig percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election, but that number has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a second in this measurement, but the percentage that sees him as the "most wählbar" has risen by far.</seg>
<seg id="28">Still, the question on what is important in a candidate, give Democratic voters questions about the wählbar.</seg>
<seg id="29">Much like last month, not a single Demokratischer candidate or potential candidate stands out for these voters in the primaries as unacceptable.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates of their party primaries yield good results in some important features for voters.</seg>
<seg id="31">See Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong Mehrheiten Führungsqualitäten.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden schneidet honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead in the best of the three candidates.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic primary voters see Clinton, Sanders and Biden also generally ideologically in line with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">With all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters has no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions are asked to continue during the tenure as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and one of Servers, Democratic primary voters are the most satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it is a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Half of Americans is now unhappy with their statement, while only around a third is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">Public opinion was split in March, shortly after the problem came to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans have said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, while 36 percent said that their opinion of her is even worse.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10 say that their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party, this is still a problem for them under eingetragenen voters as a whole: Only 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and less 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of the electorate do not keep them for an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of voters nationwide see Trump as not honest and trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">However, Clinton and Trump received good marks for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six candidates tested Biden, Carson and Bush schneiden best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority sees Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="2">Almost two years after a student died during a schikanösen Rituals student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, will be filed murder charges against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York's Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a launch Rituals in September 2013 and verzögerten his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, shared with the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he had been charged with associated eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and marriages have been attacked repeatedly, while he tried to reach a goal on a frozen field.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity was called the emergency number 911 after Deng ohnmächtig and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, police said.</seg>
<seg id="7">You had the time to switch Dengs clothing, googeln his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, however, ask for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and the Brotherhood's Wohl Michael Deng fundamentally questioned about this," said Police Chief Wagner.</seg>

<seg id="1">That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">A rate increase is coming, and the Hausse will get upset that bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we do not know how long that takes and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, the story offers little guidance to the end for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Aggressivität the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is required for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">In the end, market participants might say, however, that all the excitement was probably exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we do not expect the allmähliche US interest rates return to normal levels, but still too low level for Seis mix shock many seem to fear to lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">This does not, however, mean that there will be no impact.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look basierender on historical trends, as some areas of the economy might respond:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, the advance payment can make things of interest rate increases volatil for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase eintrifft, the impact is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Apparently, there is a tendency that asset returns are abgewürgt 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens to interest rate increases by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="18">More specifically, the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with a durchschnittlichen returns in the past six past Zyklen 14,4 percent according to a recent analysis, Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle of increase and the yield that begins to reduce.</seg>
<seg id="20">Rezessionen are a fact of business life, but they often promote interest rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank nominale GDP was at 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second was 3.6 percent of 2015, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate increases in such a fragilen economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants throughout the year to a rate increase by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many Strategen and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study have all increased Zyklen from 1950 to today put in place and pre-recession GDP levels very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade in a super cycle with increasing momentum," says the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was also volatil, because the market is anticipating a rate increase, and quite similar to the pattern as on the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities, if the change their strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">With bond yields seem to change direction, once the first increase / decrease in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle of increasing the bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">Strategen by Charles Schwab believes that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds back closer together and lead to Abflachung curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High verzinsliche bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, higher yields to be expected," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analystin at Schwab, in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interesting, Jones says, is that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of Inflationserwartungen there are few signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has been adjusted," they wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flacher credit spannen have extended their strategy and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened.</seg>
<seg id="40">By and large companies that the greater part of their Geschäftstätigkeit abwickeln in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinationale companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, and also the financing of its debt.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that" Qualitäts- "shares tend to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report three months after an initial rate increase for customers.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance übertroffen companies with weak balance after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points (percentage points) and 3 (each).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure stock games will benefit consumers by the rising dollar also.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts have different views of how quickly that will take place.</seg>

<seg id="1">David Cameron The Lorax certainly knows better?</seg>
<seg id="2">There is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will be not long before you know it almost auswendig.</seg>
<seg id="3">Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, the prime minister decided to name his favourite children's book, The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron super camps in a message on the company's website, and has continued: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I vorlese like my children, because it always seems a picture or to give a message that we have missed so far."</seg>
<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book instead of a film version of 2012 wiedergibt Inhaltsangabe new characters and details added to expand the relatively short Originaltext.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the midst of the city ummauerten Thneed Ville where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, in their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">As if that were not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the city ummauerten Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he zugibt pragmatischer a father to be here, it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book so little. Hears cases of an unnamed boy, such as the local environment by the greed of money and trees, despite the protests of the name Lorax Thneed Strick Once-ler, a Hock end schnurrbärtigen beings, "that speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely was such a relatively low PR task a helper delegiert who has read The Lorax 20 times in a row, not a child.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still hard</seg>
<seg id="2">Has selected in England's squad for the trip to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if one sees is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out an away victory.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting list and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a young and positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, developed with the ball is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">Related news: Adam Lyth scheidet from the England Test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to let Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyse as his head coach in Yorkshire, of course,.</seg>
<seg id="8">There were two good attacks in difficult conditions in his seven Tests, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.</seg>
<seg id="9">There was no question mark there with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination - and I said this vorhin - players are their own best chooser.</seg>
<seg id="10">A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he was not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; he is a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances, as Sam Robson got in front of him, while Nick Compton nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to play Heim- and abroad.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only accusation you can levy was that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan Trott as Lyth in peak form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man I einschätze high.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X factor Cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us at Trent Bridge pitch 236, which made us very.</seg>
<seg id="19">He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but that of course depends on the team to a position in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea of Moeen beat next to Cook to leave, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and received four Quicks, appeared on, and I have nothing against it.</seg>
<seg id="21">I do not see why can't beat a man there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a devil guy from Cricket players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen has perhaps not done its job for Worcester County hire, but he is a number 3 for them, and because there is no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as Opener.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has now made three hundred runs and has not looked back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as Back Up Spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Punt, but there are a large number of Backup Spinnern raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the England team has made a few clever Ergänzungen in the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the game's most nette guys mitbringen a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball part of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he created for the International Cricket competition is as a player or as a coach and as Mahela has Einsichten, from which we can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the cabin Umkleide, even if the messages are consistent with what has previously been said.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys team colleague in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One Dayers Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Some will not agree, but Coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you must bear in mind that their jobs depend, as with the players from the results.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticise Public Health England report on electronic cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Claims a state funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to Tabakindustrie, said researchers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined by the Lancet to criticise Nachweise used by Public Health England (PHE) in her report on electronic cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."</seg>
<seg id="5">But some researchers have called into question the Belastbarkeit data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the Tabakindustrie.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "außerordentlich windige basis," reasoned PHE on his most important conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "are based on stone or sand."</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Simon Cape well, professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Klinische and health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "A fundamental principle is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness of public health."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detaillierten review of Nachweise and modeling.</seg>
<seg id="10">Indeed, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a more technical criteria Entscheidungs analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine containing products to Synthese; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose CEO is previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also signed BAT's references to public health in a Nachhaltigkeit report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding it after reports earlier should have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered, but they include several known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry funding in the paper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Know how in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">Taking part in the meeting also took the PHE tobacco pipe.</seg>
<seg id="17">The group's research, "admits bezeichnenderweise," wrote that it is the damage of most products on most of the criteria "for a lack of" hard Beweisen McKee and Cape well.</seg>
<seg id="18">But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Cape well said that serve as a way to smoking for children or Nichtraucher PHE's assertions that "there is no evidence so far that electronic cigarettes were" premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE said that was already previously responded to the allegations by BMJ.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smoker dies at his Sucht.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison to this, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the dangers relativen compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="26">Through the clear Vorlegen current Beweisen that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national jurisdiction.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should abandon East Enders, former boss of Channel 4 says</seg>
<seg id="2">The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop to send programs such as East Enders and The Voice. "He said that commercial rivals" would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs, which are not sent by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticised the BBC for public legal programs, which is likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place in controversial Zeitfenster hard against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, told Johnson that he is six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends the Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC, which would also clearly demonstrated by not subventionierten rivals," Johnson said.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others do not, or commissioned.</seg>
<seg id="8">You send The Voice in einem erstklassigen Zeitfenster, because they want to reach as broad a support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax to fund programs that could be funded without Subventionen.</seg>
<seg id="11">The voice is such a program, East Enders is another zugegebenermaßen both own product ions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for.</seg>
<seg id="13">I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public and legal television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, Channel 4 ran from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the chase for ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give that back to what Tony Ball, the former head of Sky in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East Enders.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the programs rather public service "should go to BBC4, where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue that if they go to their pseudo saints missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "</seg>
<seg id="18">You put them in a Zeitfenster in which no one ever wanted to see them.</seg>
<seg id="19">For broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more objective recourse system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think that we are receiving a great value for £150 per year here, but for those who wonder is £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, aussagte also before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, to form and maintain."</seg>
<seg id="22">He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially klassifiziert as education - he said that there were 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of public service television in Australia and Canada, this change to "inform, educate and entertain."</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of Partnerschaften Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, he said that only a handful of which will be shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters say alliances to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="7">The researchers said that Würmer showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics at Ultraschall can be used to activate a series of Gehirn- Herz- and muscle cells outside of the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, a abgibt invasives procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Thread Würmer does not usually respond to Ultraschall Chalasani, however, noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the Würmer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP 4 ion channels and in the Membranen Würmer by some of the cells are found.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are zugeordnet, according to a report in Nature Communications.</seg>

<seg id="14">If he applies Ultraschall on modified creatures that sound waves are amplified and transmitted through the micro bubbles in the Würmer, where they turn on the amended Moto Neuronen.</seg>
<seg id="15">The case has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a bahnbrechenden tool allows the scientists Neuronen Impulsen des Lichts auszuschalten.</seg>
<seg id="16">But sono Genetics Chalasani said, could have a number of advantages to this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue of low frequency ultrasound waves can happen without hindrance, and can be sent from the top of the skull in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with Gentherapie and a therapeutischen virus, it is possible to make the zielten human Neuronen temporarily vulnerable for Ultraschall signal in a klinischen setting for certain neuro logical treatments," Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin produzierende cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="2">Eleven years ago I moved than even vergessener 19 left Berets and moral Relativismus students in a residential home, still in the faith, but now I remind myself of the strained smile - and many of those who I've geärgert langatmigen complaints about others.</seg>
<seg id="3">Most of what I have learned, can be destilliert in eight simple rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">The collection in student housing Heime ranges from slightly nervous aufreibend to absolutely terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is tempting to tell schwatzen: People where you come from, if and where you have sabbatical year taken yet because of where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite "said neither honestly hate guys in seriousness, it is only an extract Hefe hahaha, I am" in my room.</seg>
<seg id="6">You breathe through.</seg>
<seg id="7">And you help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.</seg>
<seg id="8">In contrast to those with whom you are talking about, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire had Löscher guides the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like.</seg>
<seg id="9">Lassen people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The rooms of people often turn to drink recipe ions, movie night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people put themselves and their underwear right back.</seg>
<seg id="11">Related to this, you start thinking not of the university with a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a Refugium, but many students living Heime form a room to room Bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship continues, but you have to weggehen so that I get the energy back I verbraucht for interaction with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">You try to feel when a Kommilitone anzuklopfen Geselligkeit is exhausted - and you will send him a text message.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of anklopfen: You Tun.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy in my student residential homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw a few things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Backen close friendship.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you begin the university at the height of the Back mania is the Klopfen at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, so I have baked you something. And now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">Hausgemachte offering treats is a good way to close Freundschaften.</seg>
<seg id="23">Their Mitbewohner feel obliged to entertain themselves and will associate at the end of your face, perhaps with a delicious surprise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course this depends on whether you are a decent Bäcker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bad vermischte Klumpen lead from flour, sugar and fat, people are sleeping, if you anklopfen.</seg>
<seg id="26">To steal food, is a gängiges crime in student residential homes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, the claws of Hühnchen is a theft, but it is also take a drop Milchs for your tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">You check the owner with the milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even when they cook inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone stiehlt your stuff that is annoying, and you have my Mitgefühl - but you try umzugehen ausgewogener Spülmittel to punish thieves as my Mitbewohnerin added to their milk.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You should make no noise abhält people from sleep or work.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not just about being a decent person, but that they belong in the truest sense of the word say to the people who sit in the glass house.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl on my Flur asked their neighbours to ask whether it makes them a little Drum & Bass something quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and they had a test in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="35">You responded with yet more loud music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally at 5 p.m., they left their neighbours freundlicherweise sleep two hours before they had their own music aufhörten plärren abschloss their door and came to the three hour test.</seg>
<seg id="37">Would it not be romantisch, if your future Ehepartner would randomly move students living in the same home?</seg>
<seg id="38">It might not be Mitbewohnerin Abgrund deeply embarrassing when you consider your future Ehepartnerin ranmachen to separate them again and they need to see it every day, and perhaps witness as herüber draws all common friends?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot Mitbewohnerin is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin you try, at least einzureden your body under a little bit of common sense.</seg>
<seg id="40">Leave In aufregenden moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room, the line between a Ulk and harassment is not verschlossenem feiner than it seems.</seg>

<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in Eckental means fränkischen terraced houses for people who do not have much money.</seg>
<seg id="3">So for instance for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but as the single mother and low earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I show how you can build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are pushed in the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper Wohnraum can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution you offer?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in Containern or gym halls has no Nachhaltigkeit.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people stay here to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In light of the refugee Stroms Wohnraum we need enough in the next few decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">A very banales three geschossiges Reihenhaus is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A Reihenhaus needs less space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different, if it brings people into residential blocks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four Asylbewerber.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living Aufenthaltsraum.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without plot.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is überschaubar.</seg>
<seg id="23">Has taken six months of construction.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have the paramotor verkompliziert their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner, Baur Real, I have learned through my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Particularly complicated there is always the threat of Damokles sword Sonderbau and the regulation of parking space.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still needs at least three who creates three apartments in a Reihenhaus Stellplätze.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities is a lack of space for it.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and Asylbewerber have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">As residents have responded to their Reihenhaus project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner Asylbewerber: There have been those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings.</seg>
<seg id="34">What is definitely not.</seg>
<seg id="35">But do not exacerbate the competition by bezahlbare housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: Bauboom in Germany is true: We have had in the last five years, but were built luxury flats that no one can afford more.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message that ordinary people also need Wohnraum.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but as the single mother or the low earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I show how you can still build cheap and good.</seg>
<seg id="40">So it goes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Federal Reserve Strategen two days this week to spend their most anticipated meeting in years sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table, in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Drohend verzierten, two of them at one end of the floor sitting room is a wall painting of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximierung US employment and keep prices stable here.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a shouted unge Benes third mandate: Financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict them. It is to be announced on Thursday, if the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 entwöhnt.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by increasing the Zinses for Bunds - and it is also only about a quarter of a percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they" see Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm Stifel Nico Laus said & Co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty is enough justification to continue to wait around the global market," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which unsettled the financial market to itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate increase this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">Financial markets expect the Fed, with a key indicator, but a Abwarten anzeigt only a 30% chance of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless that Strategen abmildern blow by promising that a further increase is far away.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action has been triggered by expectations that the Fed policy this week's sentence aufrechterhält, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="16">It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If it does, "they would have to go very far in their statement, in order to reassure the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that a rate increase would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate of 0,25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a langsamen tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen had said that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress this year they would be required to expect a rate increase in spring and early summer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the Levels, the Fed considers Vollbeschäftigung.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And although inflation was constantly under the year target of 2% of the central bank, said the Fed's representatives that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower Ölpreisen.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macro Economics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets all over the world zuckten together late last month, after China had abgewertet its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drosseln global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">Something the market has recovered in this month, with the Dow is now up almost 10% below the high of last May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the Fed representatives should influence the market turbulence of the complex calculation, when to increase rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, it would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.</seg>
<seg id="33">None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, so they should be involved in their decisions not technically.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end, the Fed's monetary authority in the world.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere hint of Ben S. Bernanke then leader in 2013 that the Fed could reduce their monetäre expansion "Vere," triggered confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks can be expected from the Fed representatives and experts advise that in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management of the firm Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which apparently are not associated with the fundamental economic data."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting berechtigtes de uses for an interest rate increase, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite begrenzter erkennbarer impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later, these cuts made the Fed chief.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should set only during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England to set interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"You will certainly not get in the situation in which she has said fear of a rate increase, because the markets" aufregen, poses, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not mentioned Finanzstabilität, and until that is changed, I do not think they should rush ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery is easy on gewichtige people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether easy gewichtige chirurgische people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Black Stone, an expert of weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial about the new study in JAMA Surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or obesity surgery, use different methods to get the size of the Magens verkleinern.</seg>
<seg id="6">You reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years obesity operations have been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been carried out on people who are ill arrest fettleibig with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24,9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered fettleibig.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers used data from Taiwan's Min Sheng General Hospital, which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery, gastric Bypass and stomach tubing including education, medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those who undergo this operation, fell from 31 to 24,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile remained roughly the same in 29 of the BMI in those who received non chirurgische diabetes treatments</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those who undergo a surgery completely solved the diabetes disease at 36% and 28% in part.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medically treated group succeeded in only about two percent compared to only one percent of diabetes in full or in part.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, were the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL Cholesterins "generally better in the surgery group," the authors found out.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers also überwachten mirror of the patient's blood Hämoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hämoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the surgery, the average Hämoglobin A1c level fell by about 9 percent to around 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group but remained stable at around 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But these better glykämische "control" - as it is reflected in the improved Hämoglobin A1c level - not reduced mortality in five years, the Leitende researcher Dr. Chih Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fifth year the Bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrektomie group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reverse course in BMI (7.4 at 5.1) and Hämoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a more complete overcoming of diabetes (46,9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>

<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival of the surgery patients, said Black Stone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BMI group," no increased risk of death or kidney disease, they said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Black Stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously, as soon as the patient lies with his BMI between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think that we wait too long, until we get people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>

<seg id="23">You admitted that "it could be better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.</seg>

<seg id="25">He tells me not to say what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.</seg>

<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from this perspective, I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be truly objective.</seg>

<seg id="7">"That emerges again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about fighting ring, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensiven Trendwende system or techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent is obviously a great team to train there for three years now, and he has to lose, and he is therefore probably not accustomed to, so it was a bit of a shock for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is funny how that appears again and again in this season.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy Bennetts idea was attacked as a "football from" exciting football "and his mentor reminded that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with" long.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday night, and how exciting it was, "said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a long because team, and Wayne said that he will attend a Scheiß dirt.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I baue stronger confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a better result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Broncos' game was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Make or break and Spannendes no points?</seg>
<seg id="24">For me, it is the game plans.</seg>
<seg id="25">When they mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage still on it.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the cron Ulla Vorfinale Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park. The ticket sale will start from next Tuesday morning.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Federal Constitutional Court has given a former detainee of judicial enforcement Tegel right monatelang was housed in a small cell.</seg>
<seg id="3">Because of the violation of their Menschenwürde prisoners in principle entitled to financial compensation, if they are housed in small cells.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in a decision published on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the judges, even if those affected can hope for money, if they were only a few days in the tight spaces (Az.: 1 BvR eingesperrt 1127 / 14).</seg>
<seg id="6">So that was a former detainee successfully with its constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space in the Justice Institute Berlin Tegel prison between June and November 2009; the toilet was not spatially separated.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then, the man who is now back at large was, according to his lawyer, had been moved to a larger cell.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and the Flüchtlingspolitik: "We create the"</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Bundeskanzlerin is determined to adopt them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What comes to Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 Asylbewerber Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).</seg>
<seg id="5">Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can create that, given the unusual challenge and we create it."</seg>
<seg id="6">What zukommt on Germany, gives the following overview.</seg>
<seg id="7">Used to be different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and for the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That is almost twice as much as 250000 homes will be built (so far).</seg>
<seg id="9">Dramatically, the lack of Wohnraum is, however, especially with bezahlbaren rental properties: A year fall out 60000 to 80000 social housing refugees from the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing will also apply.</seg>
<seg id="10">Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Far too little is that from the point of view of Pestel Institut: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that would have the federal government invest a promotion to the tune of 6.4 billion per year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Are scientists and federal construction minister agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to estimates from the Institute for work Markt- and professional research is expected that 55 percent of Geflüchteten can eventually be acquisition work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="14">Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education, however, were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticised the refugees in Germany in Bertel Mann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, is whether they can find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self esteem of immigrants, migration for Douglas Dietrich Thränhardt says.</seg>
<seg id="17">There has been a political turning point: The ban on work for refugees in recognition of work according to Thränhardt in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">Whereas before there was a ban on work for Asylbewerber by up to five years, this has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limited Asylbewerber at a residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the view of society - also because of a lack of skilled workers - the majority has asserted that refugees should be allowed faster access to employment.</seg>
<seg id="20">A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of English.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far there are no ausreichendes offer language courses related to education and work.</seg>
<seg id="22">Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt view of the royal road to integration work.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration found that few geflüchtete parents give their children in Kitas, there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the entwurzelten zuhalten parents is very important, the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">In order to convince the family still hand slip from the benefits of Kita, the administration distributed in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">The need for female educators should rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">Students in the countries without knowledge of German welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="28">You are fully trained but not always informed Lehrerinnen and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teaching staff who have a qualification in English as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of Berlin school administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no state Asylbewerbern or patience, but prohibits the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, inside Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.</seg>
<seg id="32">Studierwilligen refugees could be made easier access to university.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a stay Gestattung Asylbewerber performance or Duldung receive no benefits under the law, if they start a study.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter have basically no Bafög, because they are not covered by the circle of people entitled to BAföG.</seg>
<seg id="35">Geduldete refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be Bafög right from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen Krach Berlins undersecretary for science, and the German student demand.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should immediately get Bafög.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, the religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The state should give Islam gradually the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right weiterentwickeln Religionen ratio to a new state.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic charity drive professional association that cares for the newcomers.</seg>
<seg id="41">Belong to the rights and obligations.</seg>
<seg id="42">As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear Ansprechpartner and be willing to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some Kontrollmöglichkeiten.</seg>
<seg id="43">This also includes the willingness to act against religious Fundamentalismus beherzt.</seg>
<seg id="44">The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts will be taken to Germany on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who have wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "to immediately have their right, the Bayrischen Rundfunk verwirkt here, in Germany," he said.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed to translate the Grundgesetz to Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will be a theme of the whole society, much longer than today.</seg>
<seg id="48">So that the majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pushing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Germany has a point against discrimination and Allgemeines equal opportunities law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.</seg>
<seg id="50">But it is very slow, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: What not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups are calling for a long time and what international agreements require Germany, such as the Anti Racism Convention, must be a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and his new Bürgerinnen citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In general, Germany was able to feed the refugees expected to date medical doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="53">"In terms of man- power and capacity we create that," he told the Daily Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="54">But for that extra money has to flow into the system.</seg>
<seg id="55">In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to hand all the same Ankömmlingen during registration.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services provided could be abgerechnet later with the states.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long run, it is highly fragwürdig abzuspeisen vorsehe so many people with limited performance catalogue, the Asylbewerber performance law.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.</seg>
<seg id="59">So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants will be aufgeklärt about their illness worse than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Praxen Dolmetscher costs would be taken not only in clinics, also a doctor, she urges.</seg>
<seg id="61">Helped would be many refugees but also with more general medical Ambulanzen starting points in the event of an emergency.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostischen look.</seg>
<seg id="63">Under refugee children, for example, give it far more unbehandelte disabilities and HIV awareness among young people go there.</seg>
<seg id="64">German doctors would come in terms of their education but clear, with the images of some other disease, Montgomery says.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Para Siten Befall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And regarding the lack of doctors, even relief in sight is perhaps by the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a high entwickeltes education, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">To practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, might take exams again.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees in Germany ankommenden is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychological therapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Refugee children are particularly verletzlich explains BPtK Dietrich Munz, President.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatisiert.</seg>
<seg id="71">Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, suffers from others in so called flash backs with Atemnot, dizziness, heart lawn and Todesängsten.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms Schlaf- and concentration problems, firm strong shock and emotional taub are.</seg>
<seg id="73">In order to prevent that the symptoms would be chronically, an early treatment needed, Munz said.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Mentally ill Asylsuchende in Sozialämtern can make a request for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually takes several months.</seg>
<seg id="76">Subject officials or doctors were not trained for mental illness in the Sozialämtern also tend to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This often leads to false assessments, Munz says.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must be behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger stressed to Wilshere, it was not until September and provided his Rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">I am sure this optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship, is still uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate Knöchel violation and then again was back to his old swing found during the Vorsaison.</seg>
<seg id="5">This kind of "at risk of injury, not the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone heilte not good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not in connection with his Knöcheln or with the injuries that he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury from a purely medical point of view, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It also develops a unangenehmes pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The study by Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases of Wilshere recorded since his debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">League games in the last five games he played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 times.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have suffered the most injury days in six of eight times since 2007 / 08.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body stabilized durchlaufen, I am confident that he will do it and he is a career of the sort that he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and" the players who need it to treat a small Verschnaufpause, Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although Arsenal are clear favorites in Group F play on the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest effect of intimidation.</seg>
<seg id="24">Unge beat Dynamo after 41 games, after the "unbesiegbar" campaign was launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">The stadium has been shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked at Arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2006, we were very close to it, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ehrgeizig, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Friends: The comedy show that gives us some serious lessons about men Freundschaften</seg>
<seg id="2">The lack of similar representations in shows is evident, particularly with regard to how the need for men to open itself has become even verzweifelter now than ever before, such as suicide rates among young men at a 15 year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In a bid to tackle the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign announced at a erbärmliches life) 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is the heart of the fight to overcome this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressiven Symptomen verdoppelten has found that, when suffering a high enough percentage to friends with healthy mood, "had his chances of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halved the risk of mental problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course you have to have friends first, so that a friendship can work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of the communications held on social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the direct nature of the response is often more important than the importance of full contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have fun the need to appear strong, and successful lives, doubled, even if in reality dominates the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This oberflächliche success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsische values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsischer go much deep values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that has an impact on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money can't buy happiness really.</seg>
<seg id="13">The nice thing with Friends was that this focus has been placed on the head.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character was not defined by his work, but because of his personality, which was conspicuous by the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey Chandlers frequent Umarmungen moments in football gucken gemütlichen armchairs and longing of Ross and Rachel - all of which came from the knowledge that men can relate to, in any case, even if they often zurückhalten to fully explore their feelings.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telephone ministry explained it to me:... "my listeners role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has been really clear to me how even the smallest Interaktionen of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us, often feel unable to talk with friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old speech saying "I come with that" has a huge impact, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness, if you talk about problems openly. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer langfristigere coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">You clearly presents the small moments of men Freundschaften.</seg>
<seg id="21">As much as my objektiver outsider status on the phone to people in Augenblicken of despair may help the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central with friends to celebrate the day completely newly designed scenery, why not take it with you to your friends a drink at the Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see someone just sitting around in Star Bucks, you give him a smile and you say Hallo.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>

<seg id="14">If anyone believed, however, that PSG would achieve a major victory, was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, came in at Anpiff National with nine players on the field and was deep in the midfield with a five man defence and two reiht a serious opponent.</seg>
<seg id="16">But apart from a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed away on Kevin Trapps posts in the minute 34. offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead, PSG were themselves at times, with some false passports and bad accounts, not least from that patzte in no less than five attempts in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cavani had used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Yet he bewies much more skill when he brought his players into the game, and it was a pass from that Di Maria turned in a spin shot by Wiland 52. minute was over drawn on posts...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal finally came down shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayer had reached for his sixth Saisontor after fischt that a left flank of Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended any thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only a hervorragendes intervention by Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz Endergebnis could keep low, before substitute player was imprisoned Lavezzi aberkannt a gate at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Malmö coach Age Hareide, were later to that PSG played a class on his team and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifying games are not enough. "</seg>

<seg id="5">No, not in the Alt Otmar Bible, which is now published with beautiful images.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image of Otmar Alt, who has put his own personal interpretations of biblical stories in 150 Motiven on paper and canvas.</seg>
<seg id="7">His "language" with bright colours and forms of fantasy full of 75 years old receive - but what is not synonymous with "lustigen" images.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary: Adapted The relevant issues that may seem rather bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">Around three years has worked on his Bible project, for which he has taken a subjective künstlerische Themenbereichen selection from the many of the "book of all books" Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Zyklen address issues such as Way Plagen bids or are our father.</seg>
<seg id="11">So he has fascinated spontaneously several partners: This applies to the Luther publisher with his Theo logical orientation, as well as for the Kettler publishing with its emphasis on art books.</seg>

<seg id="17">This allows the 75 year-old twice a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible Project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in Wernigerode, born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that the strict protestantischen Herrnhuter Order served at all.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Because the education" ever happened with the pipe floor, Otmar Alt recalls.</seg>

<seg id="22">His second concern is to provide more value to the art schnelllebiger time and again: "The perception of image worlds is now dominated by advertising, and it is loud.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolik there will be ousted.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different mood and Wonne to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pictures always have something full of mystery and are not dekorativ.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect I am a dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt would discover that the viewer into the images "fall" to allow them to work on themselves, and feel what power they have: "The picture is his counterpart."</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus begreift old Post confessed on Tuesday in the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible Otmar Alt Foundation, to be "always" been a lover of Otmar Alts art: "I like how he lives with his pictures."</seg>
<seg id="29">Age have not been careful to fully grasp the Bible, but selected the issues important to him, even mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="30">"All the old post was no cooperation on an equal footing," says: "Here is the images, the text explains." Emerged as a Bible pictures.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler from Luther's publishing this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom."</seg>

<seg id="8">He had been against, because: "For a bit after death," he said sounded like an exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you die, you come to the museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The beeindruckende collection had already made before in Montreal, Canada and Paris station.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It is about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger more died.</seg>

<seg id="4">That alone is no longer works today, Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of fashion tip Plauen explains.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauener top fashion played a greater role, was then replaced by the home textile industry, and is now being discovered again as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt cites some examples: Lead in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Make the so called Vintage fashion anlehnt at last style eras, an increasing potential job at all.</seg>
<seg id="9">Anyone who uses no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us, they already account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen is a member along with nine other companies in the industry association Plauener lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">They just cannot bear the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around 80 per cent in the past 15 years are Umsatzes weggebrochen.</seg>

<seg id="15">Our products hardly reach the customers in this way.</seg>
<seg id="16">The bulk commodity will today much more cheaply produced in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively on chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also schwächle currently export to Russia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="18">Enough reasons so for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">The industry association tried to score points by environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer said of the Stick Perle hawks stone: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce verträglich environmentally and socially."</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "It also refers to the materials used."</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches snow outside of West sächsischen Hochschule Zwickau, at the Faculty of Applied Arts, Berger and specialises in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">Find high quality and innovative products in order to counter a bit of competition from the Asian region.</seg>
<seg id="23">It takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">It creates a Spannungsfeld between the fresh ideas of the designers and the Betrieben must think especially economically, "says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often variiert only slightly, in order to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter newly revitalized the historic pyramid top.</seg>
<seg id="27">The machine stickt Kügelchen small in some places.</seg>
<seg id="28">The gold smiths Plauener Champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße could inspire them: "Before I could start with traditional Plauener tip nothing."</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she uses the snowball headed for their jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In an elaborate procedure they prägt the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region to identify with the subject Plauener lace - young and old," says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It also supplies - mainly to customers in the United States, Australia and Finland, whose ancestors have lived in Plauen and the surrounding area, like a piece of memory.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I see my jewelry as modern ambassadors of Plauener lace.</seg>
