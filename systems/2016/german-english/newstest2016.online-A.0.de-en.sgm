<seg id="1">In an emergency call, Professor confesses to have shot his girlfriend</seg>
<seg id="2">In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told with a slightly shaky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that officials would have to come to his house.</seg>
<seg id="3">Lamb, it was important to emphasize that his "cute dog" but still alive and was probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.</seg>
<seg id="4">Inside the House, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a hand-written note was scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me". This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by lamb.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was no indication that lamb, who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had traveled already 300 miles to the school, where he shot a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his Office and killed according to the police.</seg>
<seg id="6">Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university employees have heard the shooting at 10:18.</seg>
<seg id="7">He said that lamb has made the fateful call sometime after that.</seg>
<seg id="8">Until the end of the day, there was a further death: lamb took his own life, when the police surrounded him up.</seg>
<seg id="9">A day after the shooting in the University, forcing students and faculty to hide behind closed doors the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated lamb.</seg>
<seg id="10">That helped by the investigators at both ends of the State of published details, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.</seg>
<seg id="11">Students said that they looked forward to his lessons.</seg>
<seg id="12">The police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or criminal history.</seg>
<seg id="13">Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Both taught in the Department of social sciences and history, whose teaching staff consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.</seg>
<seg id="15">At the same time, there are some tendencies to problematic behaviors.</seg>
<seg id="16">A student, Brandon beavers, who praised lamb, said he seemed a bit excited and nervous, "as if something is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="17">Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that lamb had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014-15 with stress.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, and it said that he had some health problem.</seg>
<seg id="19">In this year he taught only two online courses.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recent changes in employment policy of the University meant that the promotion for the Lamb had worked so hard for him would be no guarantee of an automatic way to a job as an Assistant Professor.</seg>
<seg id="21">University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of a conflict between lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's imagination."</seg>
<seg id="22">These are questions that can no longer answer lamb.</seg>
<seg id="23">After escaping from the campus, the police of later lambs found track when he won back in Mississippi from Arkansas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before he could be arrested lamb killed himself selbstmit a.38 caliber pistol in the backyard of a House about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner met Hel Johnson.</seg>
<seg id="25">His car was still in the driveway.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was not immediately clear why lamb to this House went, but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="27">Lamb was raised in the area.</seg>
<seg id="28">Lamb began his work at the University, which has 3,500 students in a city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and education.</seg>
<seg id="29">He earned his doctorate in education in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="30">One of the longtime friends of lambs described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.</seg>
<seg id="31">Carla Hairston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.</seg>
<seg id="32">She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who some years tried to teach her how to play the guitar.</seg>
<seg id="33">He was at that time the heart-throb.</seg>
<seg id="34">All the girls melted away, when he was", said Hairston, now 40 and in the Jackson suburb of Brandon resident.</seg>
<seg id="35">Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the emergency, lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there was no certificate of marriage.</seg>
<seg id="37">They had a dog named lightning, who lived with them in the brick house, which is adjacent to a bayou in Gautier.</seg>
<seg id="38">The police said that was the dog in order.</seg>
<seg id="39">The ex-husband of Prentiss, Shawn o' Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago were, but remained friends and had a daughter, which was now 19 years old.</seg>
<seg id="40">"She was totally devastated", o' Steen said about his daughter.</seg>
<seg id="41">She and her mother were best friends.</seg>
<seg id="42">O' Steen said he never met lamb, but by his daughter Abigail, he heard that lamb was interested in music and played Blues.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lamb met Prentiss, he and Abigail were both on a summer fair three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="44">Later, they played together the occasional gig.</seg>
<seg id="45">O' Steen said, his daughter writes and sings her own music.</seg>
<seg id="46">Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.</seg>
<seg id="47">Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment Coordinator at the Julep room, a dimly lit bar near the town of Gautier, said that he September 5 for the last time saw lamb and Prentiss night at night, after lamb finished in front of a sparse crowd had finished his guitar and harmonica.</seg>
<seg id="48">There was no evidence to suggest that there was something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="49">He said "just a happy couple".</seg>
<seg id="50">We were cleaning up and joked with each other.</seg>
<seg id="51">I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.</seg>
<seg id="52">Schmidt, the dead Professor, led the freshman seminar program and specialized in native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.</seg>
<seg id="53">He was married and had three children.</seg>
<seg id="54">He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was President of his fraternity and the Student Committee.</seg>
<seg id="55">On the campus of Delta State in Cleveland, 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community in a candlelight commemoration took part on Tuesday night about.</seg>
<seg id="56">Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also at the vigil took part, while the University Choir "bright morning star" and sang "Amazing Grace".</seg>
<seg id="57">Classes will resume on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.</seg>
<seg id="59">The crisis is over.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is a day of healing.</seg>
<seg id="61">Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="62">Authors Emily wagon first of Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans were Associated Press report.</seg>
<seg id="63">This story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that lamb made the distress call, after he had shot Schmidt, and that lamb Prentiss although described in his distress call as his wife, but there is no indication that that the two were ever married.</seg>

<seg id="1">8 polls, which show that Donald Trump is to take seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2">Some have tried to brand him as a flop.</seg>
<seg id="3">Others have dismissed it as a joke.</seg>
<seg id="4">And some are waiting for a breakdown.</seg>
<seg id="5">But no matter, as some Republicans are trying to pull Donald Trump, down from the upper ranks in polls it did not work (yet).</seg>
<seg id="6">Ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Trump in a double-digit lead, and some start to wonder what it means for the chances of the nomination of the real estate mogul seriously.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, it is still too early in the election period.</seg>
<seg id="8">No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.</seg>
<seg id="9">Experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry's leadership was delivered to the ascending Herman Cain, of which no one won only one State in the nomination process.</seg>
<seg id="10">And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.</seg>
<seg id="11">But outsider groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and Club for growth, a conservative economic group recognize trumps stamina now and start to their dollars, to overthrow him.</seg>
<seg id="12">Here are some recent survey values, indicating that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase.</seg>
<seg id="13">Trumps popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.</seg>
<seg id="14">Before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey of the Monmouth University showed just that only two out of ten Republicans positive saw the real estate mogul.</seg>
<seg id="15">By mid-July, it was 40 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Beginning of August it was 52 percent.</seg>
<seg id="17">Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="18">About three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion.</seg>
<seg id="19">And these numbers keep in early States.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Iowa, a Quinnipiac poll stated last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.</seg>
<seg id="21">Two-thirds of GOP GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">67 percent of the Republicans said in a CNN/ORC poll last week, they were either "enthusiastic" or "pleased" If Trump was nominated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only two out of 10 say they would be "upset" if he were the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="24">Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).</seg>
<seg id="25">The next in terms of enthusiasm?</seg>
<seg id="26">Marco Rubio with only 21 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that they were "dissatisfied" or "angry", when Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="28">A majority of Republicans does not see trumps temperament as a problem.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a President, so ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.</seg>
<seg id="30">The same number is in the first area code State in the nation, the State of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a commander in Chief, according to the Quinnipiac last week.</seg>
<seg id="31">Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he had not the personality to effectively execute his Office, and nearly six out of 10 independent say that suit his temperament not in the White House, according to ABC/post.</seg>
<seg id="32">Republican voters get used to the idea.</seg>
<seg id="33">When they wear their hats of scholars, Republican voters keep Trump for real.</seg>
<seg id="34">When asked, four out of ten say most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a survey by CNN/ORC from last week that Trump was the best bet.</seg>
<seg id="35">That's a change since the time when four out of ten end of July put their money on Jeb Bush.</seg>
<seg id="36">Full disclosure: GOP voters had in the past not the clearest crystal ball.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.</seg>
<seg id="38">However, shows that a large number of GOP voters view trumps campaign as plausible.</seg>
<seg id="39">Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump beats almost everyone.</seg>
<seg id="40">Some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to trumps guidance, while the Trump support on more than a dozen other candidates is diffusely distributed.</seg>
<seg id="41">But a survey of the Monmouth University early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and the most of the other Republican candidates, Trump Garners majority support.</seg>
<seg id="42">He has 13 points before Carly Fiorina ahead of Marco Rubio 14 points ahead Walker 15 points before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally in front of RAND Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.</seg>
<seg id="43">It's a head-to-head with Ted Cruz.</seg>
<seg id="44">The only candidate who beats him?</seg>
<seg id="45">Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head.</seg>
<seg id="46">A small majority of fans of Donald Trump says that they have formed their opinions.</seg>
<seg id="47">A new CBS/NYT survey shows on Tuesday that only slightly more than half of the voters support the Trump, say that they have forgiven their votes out.</seg>
<seg id="48">Of course, much can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change the mind.</seg>
<seg id="49">46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates.</seg>
<seg id="50">However, trumps strongest competition is the other outsiders, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, at the moment, but voters who say that they have made their opinion, are twice as likely to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="51">Six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on the subject of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since two months ago, Donald Trump "Rapist" in his campaign speech called immigrants from Mexico, immigration hub and pivotal point in public discourse was to 2016.</seg>
<seg id="53">Some are concerned that the bombastic expression critical of Trump Hispano Americans from the Republican Party will keep and will damage the efforts of locations.</seg>
<seg id="54">But after the new ABC/Post poll from Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree the immigration questions with Trump.</seg>
<seg id="55">As long as so remains the immigration in the spotlight, it will apparently do Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="56">The frustration with the Government climbs to new highs.</seg>
<seg id="57">About half of the support of Republican voters is on Donald Trump and Ben Carson by their outsider status.</seg>
<seg id="58">The new Monday poll by ABC/post, six out of 10 Republicans say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.</seg>
<seg id="59">And they are also angry at Washington.</seg>
<seg id="60">A poll by the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans about the Republicans in Congress are frustrated, with 54 percent "terribly upset"dissatisfied"and 21 percent".</seg>

<seg id="2">Who smokes, is damaging not only the lungs but also the teeth - that suggests a long-term study of Potsdam.</seg>
<seg id="3">The good news: In absence of the risk decreases quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Commission proposes new Court in dispute over TTIP</seg>
<seg id="2">The European Commission proposed a major reform of the current system of arbitration to defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="3">The controversial private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and States should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system corresponding to more traditional dishes in its functioning.</seg>
<seg id="4">"We want to establish a system that citizens trust", said the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sweden intends to present the proposal as European negotiating position in the free-trade talks with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German Government announced support.</seg>
<seg id="7">TTIP is to create the largest free trade area in the world with 800 million people.</seg>
<seg id="8">The plans to reform of the current arbitration specifically provide that the EU and the United States select together independent judges for a new investment Court.</seg>
<seg id="9">Equally, they should come from the EU, the United States and from third countries.</seg>
<seg id="10">Also a second instance is provided for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would allow it to appeal against judgments.</seg>
<seg id="12">So far, the parties agreed among themselves on referees, there was not an appeal against their sentences.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the discussion of the last few months had become clear, that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström said.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the long term, she wants to work out according to an international investment Court.</seg>
<seg id="15">There, for example disputes between Chinese and EU States then could be sorted out.</seg>
<seg id="16">The investor-State arbitration required by large corporations (ISDS) are considered as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP.</seg>
<seg id="17">The traditional arbitration can be as a form of parallel justice criticized about the companies at the expense of taxpayers make compensation, national laws nullify or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards of opponents.</seg>
<seg id="18">In first opinions, TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="19">It was criticized in particular that they should not apply to the already-negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).</seg>
<seg id="20">German economy State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD), however, described the plans as a major step forward.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Commission take into account in the reform of key points, which have developed with other EU trade ministers Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="22">The old system of private arbitration tribunals is off the table.</seg>
<seg id="23">The French Government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.</seg>
<seg id="24">The European Business Association BusinessEurope warned to limit the legal remedies available to the economy through too many new rules.</seg>
<seg id="25">Particularly small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged as a result, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="26">When the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP (transatlantic trade and investment partnership) can be completed, remained unclear on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="27">The negotiations since mid-2013.</seg>
<seg id="28">The subject of investor protection was, however, not discussed so far with the United States.</seg>
<seg id="29">Originally, a framework for the agreement should be the end of this year.</seg>
<seg id="30">This date is considered to be no longer tenable.</seg>

<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sits on the stage at the Cologne Prime Club (today: Luxor).</seg>
<seg id="3">Next to him is a flip chart on which the shy-looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque state of Michigan with felt-tip pen.</seg>
<seg id="4">The audience, about 40 people, is nearly taken from Stevens lecture.</seg>
<seg id="5">He told through various places that he repeatedly draws on the map, what report his minute and delicately arranged songs.</seg>
<seg id="6">Where they originated and how it looks there, in his home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since then is wonderfully creative madman Stevens.</seg>
<seg id="8">With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" composed songs that can Nestle harmoniously very close to American folk music in the late sixties, but drift in the great opulent appear wise.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is the rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a swashbuckling series: each of the 50 U.S. States should be sung in a row.</seg>
<seg id="10">But in 2004, and near the river is already published "Seven Swans" and breaks positively certain expectations.</seg>
<seg id="11">Reduced Stevens here occurs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Live guitar and banjo meet him.</seg>
<seg id="13">A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.</seg>
<seg id="14">With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: come on feel the Illinoise") a widely acclaimed masterpiece appears in 2005.</seg>
<seg id="15">Epic of ideas and stylistic finesse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The album entered the American Billboard charts and lacking in any year ranking of influential music media.</seg>
<seg id="17">After prolific experiments uses Stevens then on "The age of ADF" (2010) very extensive electronic pieces.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sixth regular Studio album is still more broadly orchestrated, but programmed sequences of beats and playing with all kinds of effect and reverb.</seg>
<seg id="19">Long ago the smaller clubs emerged from, here are the shows to the colourful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent Bühnendeko.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sufjan Stevens is currently touring as part of a five-member band from Germany.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the dark Hamburg!</seg>
<seg id="22">He presented mainly the available since March "Carrie & Lowell" theater.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although here now almost 2000 guests sit transfixed in their chairs, the much more mature made Stevens back to the intimacy and the folk returns.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without a Word to the audience, the Group of excellent musicians through the wide-rich album plays out.</seg>
<seg id="25">From the audience can be heard: the lecture is "opulent" and you can thus the "Plate basically throw away".</seg>
<seg id="26">Only modestly thanked Stevens to an Encore, plays acoustically a few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jeremy Corbyns debut at Prime Minister's question time</seg>
<seg id="2">Since his election, Mr. Corbyns debut at question time of the Prime Minister with tension is expected</seg>
<seg id="3">The new labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn will make his debut at Prime Minister's question time and mess with David Cameron for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="4">Mr CORBYN will rise shortly after noon to make the first of his six questions, with its performance by the media likely and the Labour Members closely examined.</seg>
<seg id="5">He called for "Less theatrical and more facts" at this weekly event.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has also said that he could skip some meetings, to leave to colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="7">The meeting will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyns leadership, because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the annual meeting of the TUC on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the meantime, has provoked the decision of the labour Chairman, to remain on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the battle of Britain in silence criticism of a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in the newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr Corbyns decision to sing not the national anthem, has attracted attention</seg>
<seg id="10">A spokesman for Mr CORBYN said he would have "in respectful silence been" and he recognised the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the battle of Britain".</seg>
<seg id="11">But a member of Mr Corbyns shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told in the BBC two Newsnight programme he advised the labour Chairman, to sing the national anthem, "regardless" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="12">Almost a dozen of shadow Ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyns top team and they refer to differences in economic, defense and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences are also within "stack of labour" according to Mr Corbyns statements on the position of the European Union and limit profits.</seg>
<seg id="14">Mr CORBYN said the TUC Conference that labour submit changes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pensions Minister said hours later that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the Government's plans, the limit of 26,000 pounds to £23,000 to lower.</seg>
<seg id="16">Mr CORBYN will be the fifth labour Chairman, David Cameron, since he became Tory leader, over the past decade on the dispatch box in the House, facing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says that he has "Crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and more than 30,000 suggestions were given to him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister's question time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from "Repartee" and fights with barbs both and instead has undertaken, to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges for young people.</seg>
<seg id="19">Mr CORBYN said Angela Eagle, the shadow economic Minister will represent him if he does not take part - for example if Mr Cameron is abroad.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has brought the idea into the conversation, that other colleagues occasionally take the floor, and that he approached John Bercow, the speaker of the lower House, to discuss the problem.</seg>
<seg id="21">When he became leader in the year 2005, Mr Cameron said that he would remove from the policy in the style of a "puppet theatre", which is often associated with the Prime Minister question time is. but a few years later he admitted that he had failed.</seg>
<seg id="22">Because it was sent first in 1990 in television, question time was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important barometer of the judgment of the leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary colleagues, although critics have argued that she had become a caricature, and would require far-reaching reforms.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met cash launches Bodenständigkeits campaign to combat Aldi-invasion</seg>
<seg id="2">Met cash tries to protect the IGA stores before an Aldi March in South Australia and Western Australia.</seg>
<seg id="3">Food wholesaler met cash has launched an Bodenständigkeits campaign, the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run-up to a 700 million $ to defend Aldi invasion.</seg>
<seg id="4">While Aldi opening two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers met cash and IGA supermarkets and build the brand IGA by mainstream marketing and marketing on the social media, through events such as the Adelaide show.</seg>
<seg id="5">IGA retailers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice maker Samir from Dunsborough samples distributed in IGA stores and store owners who sell discounted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is expected that met cash released more details of its defense strategy on 29 September, when the wholesaler of food, alcohol, and equipment performs its annual investors strategy day.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is much at stake because South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met cash's IGA stores and IGA network in the Eastern States to generate higher profit margins than met cash's.</seg>
<seg id="8">Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously parochial and IGA retailers have a much greater market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia, and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to 14 percent in the Eastern States.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, believe analysts like Morgan Stanley that Aldi twelve months after opening its first stores around five percent of the food market in these two States will snatch and all existing actors, but mostly independent retailers sales will take away.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to a report published this week estimated the analyst Tom Kierath by Morgan Stanley that IGA retailers $360 million sales per year and met cash 250 million $ could lose by the end of 2016.</seg>
<seg id="11">This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi opened 25 stores next year in United States and 30 in WA and a turnover of 500 million $ 600 million and $ will achieve in each market.</seg>
<seg id="12">The loss in the food and grocery store and the quantities to met cash's high fixed cost base could met cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and tax costs, said Mr. Kierath.</seg>
<seg id="13">At the same time, met cash loses market share in the Eastern States, to Aldi and Cole's, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that IGA buyers are the most loyal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Morgan Stanley assumes that sales in the food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent will be met cash in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in the year 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in the year 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last week the leading Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan financial group, at a business lunch in Melbourne, told that met cash will likely disappear within a decade. met cash.</seg>
<seg id="16">Met cash refused to publicly respond to the comments made by Mr. Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="17">But it is assumed that a Board member of met cash last week has made contact with Mr. Douglass.</seg>
<seg id="18">IGAs market share has declined since 2010 from 18 percent to 14 percent, and income from met cash's food and food trade, which supplies 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen since 2012 by 43%, reflecting operational debt reduction for simultaneous pressure on revenue and margins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The wholesaler resists, however, and invested more than 150 million $, to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths with hundreds of products every week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their stores by faster-growing fresh food and to provide a better variety of private-label foods.</seg>
<seg id="20">Met cash's Managing Director Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and loading clean-ups to Elan will grow and hopes that the wholesalers will return again in the year 2017 for the first time in four years to profit growth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy</seg>
<seg id="2">Thanasi Kokkinakis rather deserves praise as criticism for his behavior.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damage" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves praise as criticism according to the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, rather for his own behavior.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, the as "special KS" is referred to, Montreal was the infamous confrontation of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the masters in the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a fiery qualifying match in Cincinnati soon thereafter Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee and Harrison cried out: "Wawrinka would have to beat Kyrgios, and I should hit the child."</seg>
<seg id="6">While he was last seen as he smashed a racket after a spasm of thwarted a potential US Open victory of Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in individual Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against the United Kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="8">"One thing about which I quite ereifere, is the fact that I believe Thanasi a little in the dispute was involved," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He broke a racket when he lost because of a spasm in the U.S. open, but he is not the first player who broke a racket out of frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud Thanasi.</seg>
<seg id="10">But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US open, even in the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think that he deserves a lot of credit.</seg>
<seg id="11">He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think that he has been treated a little too severe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is a very mature 19 year old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the locker room area, he trained hard, he is in good shape, it is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged on its own merits.</seg>
<seg id="13">Healy supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios, which starts on Friday, for the important preliminaries and he describes the "joint decision" as a right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return as a long-term integral part of the team."</seg>
<seg id="14">"First we want that the team is fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around it [Kyrgios]," Healy said.</seg>
<seg id="15">And I believe that Nick has risen very quickly, what people like Federer and Murray to have. it goes in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we try, some time out of the limelight, in which he only can think, I appropriate, consider him the consequences of his actions to make. and it is best for the team and it's the best for him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes the border, holding back refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Hungary declared a State of emergency and the southern border with Serbia sealed off on Tuesday and detained everyone who tried everything with the aim of illegally in the country to come. to stop the influx of migrants.</seg>
<seg id="3">Chaos followed on the border, as hundreds of migrants accumulated in a no man's land, and Serbian officials reacted with outrage.</seg>
<seg id="4">The people who had fled from violence, were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of countries and built tents and settled there.</seg>
<seg id="5">But frustrations have increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a police helicopter over them was floating, chanted the migrants "Will open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian riot police.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some refused food and water in protest.</seg>
<seg id="8">Serbia's Foreign Minister said that it was "unacceptable" that migrants from Hungary would be sent back, while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive.</seg>
<seg id="9">(Serbia) want to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.</seg>
<seg id="10">It talks must take place in the coming days with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.</seg>
<seg id="11">The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the block of 28 Nations could agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Ministers agreed, however, to share the responsibility for 40,000 people in the stunned Italy and Greece refuge sought. they expressed their hope from that, next month, or until the end of the year - an agreement would reached that EU States would absorb more than 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary,.</seg>
<seg id="13">German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, Hungary did not put his hopes on an early action from Brussels or from its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="15">State of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, so that they could shut off the roads and speed up asylum procedures.</seg>
<seg id="16">Meanwhile, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that his country was planning the construction of a barbed-wire fence along its border with Romania, in order to stop the flow of migrants through the country - after it has finished a fence at the Serbian border.</seg>
<seg id="17">CBS News correspondent Charlie D' Agata reported that even prison inmates to create the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia, were used in the race.</seg>
<seg id="18">In recent months, Hungary for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East has become a significant bottleneck and the point of entry into the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="19">Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted, however, that are the most of economic migrants, who are looking for a better life, and not war refugees, who are entitled to protection - a view strongly at odds with other EU States, Germany, is among them.</seg>
<seg id="20">The new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary, crossing the border or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence, which built the Government along the southern border with Serbia, to a crime. these laws set higher sentences for convicted traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Due to the situation, which is caused by the mass migration, the Hungarian Government declared the State of emergency," Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.</seg>
<seg id="22">We make it very clear: illegal border crossing is a crime.</seg>
<seg id="23">Parliament must still agree to process even the use of the military, which is expected next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days at the border.</seg>
<seg id="24">Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said that authorities caught 45 people while trying to cross the border, 15 others had penetrated even deeper into the country.</seg>
<seg id="25">They come by they damage the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing offences under the new laws.</seg>
<seg id="26">Authorities are quick to repair the fence.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hungarian officials signed on Tuesday morning, two of the seven border crossings with Serbia, after a train car with barbed wire, arrived to close the borders.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near the Roszke, Hungary, as the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to roll in there.</seg>
<seg id="29">About 20 managed it to get in, but thousands remained outside.</seg>
<seg id="30">Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary, and said that they would refuse food and water until they may enter Hungary.</seg>

<seg id="1">Choice 2016: Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton's national poll halved</seg>
<seg id="2">The former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders her gains compared to ground.</seg>
<seg id="3">Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary (58 percent previously), while Sanders is in second place with 27 percent (17 percent increase).</seg>
<seg id="4">Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for President, receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters in the primaries.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than five months before the start of the primaries, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that your opinion is, which candidate they will support.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Clinton's supporters are more stable than those of the other candidates in their choice.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders scored some gains.</seg>
<seg id="8">Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these projections have been reduced.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only with 5 points.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton's advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has not materialised, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.</seg>
<seg id="11">Clinton has, however, a big advantage among older voters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Last month Clinton before Sanders was with double-digit lead the Liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point lead in this group.</seg>
<seg id="13">About half of democratic voters in the primaries across the country say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="14">A quarter would support with some reservations and another 15 percent would support them only because she is the candidate.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six percent would not support them.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton's current supporters of her excited.</seg>
<seg id="17">The views are more mixed for those who do not currently support Clinton--only about a quarter would support enthusiastically.</seg>
<seg id="18">While 48 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, less Republican voters say about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).</seg>
<seg id="19">If Clinton's supporters in an open question asks why they want that she is the candidate, is followed by the view that it is time that a woman President is (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent) the most common answer that she has the right experience (16 percent).</seg>
<seg id="20">Of Clinton's supporters, also their connection with Bill Clinton (9 per cent) is mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="21">Consent to deal with the problems and the eligibility are also cited.</seg>
<seg id="22">As the Vice President raises a potential for the Presidency in the balance, 57 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do it.</seg>
<seg id="23">When democratic voters in the primaries are asked who would be their second choice for the party, is Biden at the top.</seg>
<seg id="24">More than half say of Clinton's supporters that Biden would be their second choice well ahead of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="25">Biden, decides not to run for the Democratic nomination Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders, of 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race increases.</seg>
<seg id="26">Fifty-five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance to win the election; however, this figure of 78 percent has decreased in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="27">Biden is a second in this measurement by far, but the percentage that "wählbarsten" sees it as the, has increased.</seg>
<seg id="28">Nevertheless, at the question of what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.</seg>
<seg id="29">Similar as in the last month, not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters to the primaries as unacceptable stands out.</seg>
<seg id="30">The Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results for some important characteristics among voters of their party primaries.</seg>
<seg id="31">Majorities consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy, and equipped with strong leadership qualities.</seg>
<seg id="32">Biden performs in the three candidates the best in honesty, while Clinton's strength is the lead.</seg>
<seg id="33">Thirty percent of democratic voters believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="34">Democratic voters in the primary elections see also Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.</seg>
<seg id="35">About a quarter of democratic voters in all of these measurements has no opinion of Sanders.</seg>
<seg id="36">As questions continue to be made Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email address and server during the term as Secretary of State, the most democratic voters in the primaries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="37">But it's a different story in the American public as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="38">Now, half of Americans is not satisfied with their explanation, while only about one-third is satisfied.</seg>
<seg id="39">The public opinion was divided in March, shortly after came the problem to light.</seg>
<seg id="40">Most Americans said that the E-Mail controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had even deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="41">There are mainly Republicans, more than six out of 10, saying that their views of Clinton have become worse.</seg>
<seg id="42">Although Clinton by the voters of their party is considered honest and trustworthy, as this is still a problem for them among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points since May.</seg>
<seg id="43">62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trustworthy person.</seg>
<seg id="44">At the same time, 55 percent of voters view across the country also Trump as dishonest and not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="45">Clinton and Trump get good marks for leadership.</seg>
<seg id="46">Of the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush cut off best with honesty.</seg>
<seg id="47">A majority view Sanders rather than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.</seg>
<seg id="48">The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primaries is 6 percentage points.</seg>

<seg id="1">Five brotherhood members charged with the death of Baruch College freshman</seg>
<seg id="2">For almost two years, after a student died during a vexatious ritual of a student fraternity in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.</seg>
<seg id="3">Members of New York's Baruch College PI Delta PSI fraternity attacked brutally Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013, and police said his transport to the hospital, which has contributed to his death, delayed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Officials said he was blindfolded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand have been charged, and repeatedly attacked while he was trying to go to a frozen field to a target.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mr.. Deng complained finally of headache, then he fell unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="6">The PI Delta PSI fraternity members called not the emergency number 911, after Deng was unconscious and the police reportedly waited an hour before they took him to a hospital.</seg>
<seg id="7">They had, however, the time to Deng's clothes to change, to contact his symptoms to Googling and Andy Meng, the National President of the fraternity, in order to obtain advice, said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.</seg>
<seg id="8">"At this point, members began to hide items and put the brotherhood basically about the welfare of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.</seg>
<seg id="9">He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to an autopsy report, Deng were repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Too many families have been through the harassment of the brotherhood destroyed. Since 1970, at least one student dies every year of the harassment", said Douglas adapted mountain, a lawyer, represents the Deng's family in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Brotherhoods and its members must be held accountable, and this move by authorities is very important.</seg>
<seg id="13">A County grand jury of Monroe recommended a charge of third-degree murder for the first five members.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are accused also because of oppressive attacks and forming a criminal organisation.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We want to blame not only the people involved, but if there is an organization, which, officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, so we will take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Baruch College has banned the brotherhood, and the national fraternity has revoked their affiliation with the group.</seg>

<seg id="1">This will happen if the Fed increases interest rates</seg>
<seg id="2">Comes an increase in interest rates, and the bull market will be shaken, bond yields will rise, and the economy will slip into a recession.</seg>
<seg id="3">We know that.</seg>
<seg id="4">What we don't know is how long it will take and how long it will last.</seg>
<seg id="5">In particular, history offers little guidance to the end for the economy.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.</seg>
<seg id="7">The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve while raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react.</seg>
<seg id="8">Therefore, representatives of the US Federal Reserve have stressed so violently that investors should focus not on when it starts to raise interest rates, but rather is the length of time required for the normalization.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, several variables play a role.</seg>
<seg id="10">At the end, market participants, however, may find that all the fuss because a rate increase was may be exaggerated.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The first increase in the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of"cheap money"", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economist at capital economics, in a note to clients.</seg>
<seg id="12">In contrast, we expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal levels, but still at a too low level, to fear the to the seismic shock, many seem to lead.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, this does not mean that there will be no effect.</seg>
<seg id="14">Here is a look based on historical trends, as some areas of the economy could respond:</seg>
<seg id="15">As the market has seen in the last month, the anticipation of interest rate increases can make volatile things for a while.</seg>
<seg id="16">As soon as the increase, the impact is not so dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="17">"There is apparently a trend stalled investment income 12 to 24 months after the first increase which again reflects the delay in the monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study to what happens after the Fed interest rate increases.</seg>
<seg id="18">Specifically, the market is in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to increase interest rates, fairly flat in the 250 days (average 2.6 percent gain), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six past cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis, the Bob doll, Chief Investment Strategist at Nuveen asset management, at Barron's published.</seg>
<seg id="19">Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stocks later tend to occur in the cycle and the return begins to decrease.</seg>
<seg id="20">Recessions are a fact of economic life, but often promote increases in interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the current case, the fed with some conditions is facing, which did not exist before and which could speed up a recession.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is quite remarkable that gross domestic product near its lowest point the Fed's interest rate increases will be.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to Deutsche Bank was the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Although the second quarter 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.</seg>
<seg id="25">Interest rate hikes in a so fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it this time is different", said Deutsche Bank.</seg>
<seg id="26">Market participants have made cool all year round on an interest rate increase in the fed, and all eyes were directed the meeting of the Federal open market Committee this week which ends on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="27">While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading is only a probability of 25 percent.</seg>
<seg id="28">"In our study all increase in cycles from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum in the GDP have taken place and made previous recession highs very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade", according to the report.</seg>
<seg id="29">In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed period.</seg>
<seg id="30">The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and so far are 74 months.</seg>
<seg id="31">The fixed income was also volatile, as the market anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market.</seg>
<seg id="32">The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares, if the change its strategic course.</seg>
<seg id="33">For bonds, the returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the end of the cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.</seg>
<seg id="35">The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the increase in interest rates will cause that yields between shorter and longer bonds closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="36">High-yield bonds better yields often bring in such a climate, although "we are cautious to expect higher returns," said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab in an analysis.</seg>
<seg id="37">Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to expectations of fed strategy.</seg>
<seg id="38">"There are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations" she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="39">Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have been extended and the volatility has risen - all characteristics of the market if the Fed tightened up its strategy.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the whole, companies which handle the greater part of their business in the United States, benefit if interest rates rise, and local products become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="41">Multinational companies with high levels of debt are worse position, as a rising dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts.</seg>
<seg id="42">"History shows that"Quality"stocks tend to react, three months after an initial increase in interest rates very positive" Sachs analysts in a report for the customers said Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="43">Companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded after each of the interest rate increases by 5 percentage points in 1994, 1999 and 2004 an average companies with weak balance sheet.</seg>
<seg id="44">Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks exceeded even their counterparts with low quality on average 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).</seg>
<seg id="45">Debt is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="46">Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, said Goldman.</seg>
<seg id="47">Outside of pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.</seg>
<seg id="48">Savers could see profits through higher yields, although experts of disagree, how quickly this will happen.</seg>

<seg id="4">He was also on the BBC Music Awards and said that they imitated only the Brits</seg>
<seg id="5">Parliament Mr Damien Collins attacked the broadcast of the voice and said that this is not very original.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC Radio 3 "turns" to Classic FM, claims a leading member of Parliament, and raises new pressure to the transmitter, to prove that he is doing something the private broadcasters do not.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Conservative MEP Andrew Bingham said also the BBC bosses that the public service radio station "verdumme" and is increasingly no longer indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Radio 3 seems - I use the word"dislike - idiots"but it seems to turn to Classic FM", he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was also on the BBC Music Awards, which started in last December.</seg>
<seg id="10">The BBC Music Awards, which started in the last year, seem to be the Brits only under a different name.</seg>
<seg id="11">So if you try something else to do - this two are spontaneously mentioned examples where you imitate only that what is already on the market", said Mr Bingham.</seg>
<seg id="12">BBC Director - General rejected the allegations and argued that Radio 3 far ahead of its commercial competitors is BBC, when it comes to live music and public education.</seg>
<seg id="13">What I'm learning from Radio 3 I will nowhere else learn about classical music.</seg>
<seg id="14">And there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly unsurpassed.</seg>
<seg id="15">"And 3, to find new music and to give new works, I think the commitment of radio really important," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Earlier this year, BBC argued Radio 3 controller Alan Davey that harder work must be done to engage the audience, as it did in the past, because the British of less about classical music are informed.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that it came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on culture, media and Sport Select to enter the commercial rivals on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Tory MP Damien Collins attacked the voice - the musical talent show for the BBC, by the Dutch producer Talpa media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ was purchased.</seg>
<seg id="19">See why this program is discussed often, because it's not original and not particularly distinctive?</seg>
<seg id="20">Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - was produced with Paloma faith and Boy George as a judge - "in a special BBC way".</seg>
<seg id="21">He added that he hoped that the company "find a hit from our own stable" when it next time start a conversation series.</seg>
<seg id="22">However, he refused to rule out ordering further rows of the voice in the future or to spend the fee payer for other entertainment formats.</seg>

<seg id="20">"She wanted to help other people," said Knowles</seg>
<seg id="21">The police said that lamb had called relatives at some point on Monday to tell them "he will not go to jail".</seg>
<seg id="22">When police officers brought him on Highway 1 near the town of Greenville later in that night, drove his car to the side of lamb, fled on foot, ran into the Woods and killed himself with a shot.</seg>

<seg id="9">In the locker room, he had an oxygen mask.</seg>
<seg id="10">He was crying.</seg>
<seg id="11">I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then that lasts for six months, and he will not play in the group stage.</seg>

<seg id="6">All well and good, except that the following paragraph in the Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead a summary the film version of 2012 reflects, which added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.</seg>
<seg id="7">"In the walled city Thneed-Ville, where all of nature is gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, he met her desire to see a real tree, by", reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, the real name of Theodor Seuss which was hostage and who died in 1991, but completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="8">If it still not suspicious enough: the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lorax film, which will be presented on the Web site of Internet movie database and so begins: "In the walled city Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."</seg>
<seg id="9">Although he admits Yes to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron the plot of the book as little familiar is an unnamed boy, like the yarn local environment through the Thneed of money-grubbing, be felled trees, once-ler despite the protests of the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, moustached creature "that speaks in the name of the trees", listen here is devastated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Most likely, such a relatively low PR task to a helper has been delegated, not 20 times in a row has read the Lorax a child.</seg>
<seg id="11">A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.</seg>
<seg id="12">SuperCamps confirmed but no more immediate comments that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, was.</seg>

<seg id="1">Adam Lyth was threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard</seg>
<seg id="2">Is a difficult task to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, but when you see the squad, England has selected for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my card.</seg>
<seg id="3">I would not rule out an away win.</seg>
<seg id="4">Alastair Cook's side is less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good players of spin in the batting lineup, and the community spirit is strong; they will carry no scars of 2012, only a teen positive attitude.</seg>
<seg id="5">Moeen Ali developed as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid with the ball, even if it is an unknown quantity at the test level, is an option for the attack.</seg>
<seg id="6">News related to this: Adam Lyth withdraws from the England test squad and will be replaced by Alex Hales.</seg>
<seg id="7">The decision to let Adam Lyth, is of course for me as his head coach in Yorkshire, hard to parse.</seg>
<seg id="8">In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players on results are aligned.</seg>
<seg id="9">There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led players to the nomination, because - and I have said this before - are their own best selector.</seg>
<seg id="10">Long ago, you would have extended the run of Lyth, but he was in control of his own destiny.</seg>
<seg id="11">If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The England coach of Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not so well, and that doesn't surprise me; he is above all a team man.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question of how much time a test batsman gets to put his mark, is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="14">Lyth got seven chances - as Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.</seg>
<seg id="15">Only Compton got the chance to home and away.</seg>
<seg id="16">The only charge that you can charge was that England was Jonathan Trott set in in the Caribbean – first as a Lyth in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past.</seg>
<seg id="17">Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man, I value a.</seg>
<seg id="18">He is an X factor cricketer, what we early saw at Yorkshire this season, when he scored 236 against us on a Trent bridge place, what really hit us.</seg>
<seg id="19">It must have at least the same opportunities as those ahead of him, but of course this depends on the line-up in the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="20">The idea, hitting Moeen in addition to Cook, which would provide an extra spin bowler and get four Quicks, appeared, and I don't mind.</seg>
<seg id="21">I don't see why a batsman there can not do, and this left-hander has already shown that he is a devil of a fellow of cricket players.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moeen has perhaps not done his job for his County Worcestershire, but is he a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.</seg>
<seg id="23">He joined as an opener in 2001, my former team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop.</seg>
<seg id="24">He has managed three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.</seg>
<seg id="25">Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man.</seg>
<seg id="26">People might see his stats on - average 31 with the bat and the ball 35 - and think it's a punt, but there is no large number of backup kooks who raise their hands and the coaches have opted for youth.</seg>
<seg id="27">He will learn a lot on this tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">Apart from the team, England has made a couple of clever additions with the coaching staff.</seg>
<seg id="29">The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.</seg>
<seg id="30">He is one of the nicest guys in the game, which will bring a wealth of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.</seg>
<seg id="31">Paul Collingwood for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.</seg>
<seg id="32">I always felt that he is created for the international cricket competition as a player or as a coach, and how Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.</seg>
<seg id="33">Sometimes, new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the messages in accordance with the above.</seg>
<seg id="34">Collys team-mate at Durham, Ben is not used Stokes, in the one-Dayers, root received a similar break against Australia and for my part, I have no problem with that.</seg>
<seg id="35">Although some will not agree, but coaches and team operators determine not the schedule.</seg>
<seg id="36">And you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results.</seg>
<seg id="37">Such decisions are made not light hearted.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brexit camp (Brexit = exit Britain from the EU) could win at inlet if the economy up to the year 2017 in a lull</seg>
<seg id="2">David Camerons half-baked renegotiation strategy, to keep Britain in the EU, is with each passing day more deeply get into trouble, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy "it is Yes or no?" CORBYN, Director of labour or the TUC, which itself fell sharply because of Europe on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Foreigners have also their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.</seg>
<seg id="4">A European diplomat friend said recently that some Member States, so deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is it and not getting out of their own debt, Britain's own agenda with split concessions and disruptive changes to the Treaty, which most of the time they do not want are fed up.</seg>
<seg id="5">In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it also doesn't like this, if they endanger the social protection.</seg>
<seg id="6">We could call it Dave and Georges Selfies agenda.</seg>
<seg id="7">Prime Minister and Minister of finance climb to the Summit and bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say that they win allies for reforms.</seg>
<seg id="8">It's always about me.</seg>
<seg id="9">My European friend, the one for outside lighting UK inside the EU tent wishes - "Let us not only with France", says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted Ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point, where it is they don't care whether we stay or go.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany cautiously prudent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but it has been 10 years in power and wants to leave the Office before it looks bad for them as it happened with the excessively long waiting out like Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and cabbage (16).</seg>
<seg id="11">France's François hollande looks at his re-election or its replacement in the year 2017.</seg>
<seg id="12">He is also a fading force.</seg>
<seg id="13">Poland has a left a nationalist right-wing Government, Spain may soon.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is difficult to imagine that they will bend over backwards to, to help the Selfies British, whose Energie should be used better for Scotland's exit from the UK to prevent - something they also do not want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.</seg>
<seg id="15">Therefore some such Ministers even deliberately unhelpful comments in the SNP style might plan during Britain's referendum campaign 2017, in order to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"The renegotiation was a bust," and "Great Britain has won nothing of value from the renegotiation."</seg>
<seg id="17">The Europeans know how predatory, the fleet can be street at their expense and the oligarchy of the press barons is what EU skeptics, as they in 1975 but were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.</seg>
<seg id="18">You can contact weak Boris Johnson, remember ore euro opportunists, who has made a name as an "EU straight bananas" Brussels correspondent in the early 90's.</seg>
<seg id="19">In all of his craziness, Ed Miliband knew who were his enemies.</seg>
<seg id="20">This includes the medley of tax have villains, phone hacking aliens and the pseudo belonged to non-residents, who own most of our major newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="21">Actually, Tony Blair thought much about it, but found that if you sit down with a hot gorilla in a cage, you spread better bananas to distract him, rather than for his lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, Miliband was more Blairianer than Blair himself when he resisted Cameron's referendum back, because Blair had been the principle of the Constitution not adopted the EU, which then was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened a back door for him.</seg>
<seg id="23">The press has never forgiven that.</seg>
<seg id="24">But the Nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave a friendly Pat on the back to me on Monday at Westminster - I told him that he needed no time to waste for me anymore - seems in danger of Neil Kinnocks boycott Murdoch strategy of 80 years to repeat a mistake then and now.</seg>
<seg id="25">It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to attract the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, the BBC sofa he left on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="26">Corbyns official position to Europe – I say time friendly - in development.</seg>
<seg id="27">He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.</seg>
<seg id="28">Well, outside of Ukips traditional blue dye tendency and the Wilder realms of Tory small Engländerismus everyone can say most people Yes.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is what this week said Hilary "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and on television as the Scouts in it struggled not to admit that Corbyns appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.</seg>
<seg id="30">It reminded me of the 70s, when his father tried on television about to be disloyal to his labour Cabinet colleagues not to go too far and lose his Cabinet job.</seg>
<seg id="31">Hilarys fight was even more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="32">To fight, but to stay "in all circumstances" - Benns expression - was not what said McDonnell, still what JC told his comrades and members by all accounts at its closed-door meeting on Monday night.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are thinking what will - give always the sentimental image of bottom-up from CORBYN that he has stirred even me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock important and above all in the vortex of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is right to give Cameron no free pass for Europe, which allows him to keep Labour's support in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said it goes without saying.</seg>
<seg id="35">Simon Jenkins thinks certainly so.</seg>
<seg id="36">But McDonnell and Corbyns fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with their Bennite siege economy, its anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left dissidents for the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.</seg>
<seg id="37">As Tom Watson is rock solid with its ambiguities to NATO - convinced that JC is launching a campaign to exit the - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superiors in all at home.</seg>
<seg id="38">Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they have also suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British when all this may be pointless?</seg>
<seg id="39">The United States are already quite disappointed by the poor military performance in the Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting the Tory Government in power, what I was reminded of something at the start on Monday, what British influence security forum called.</seg>

<seg id="1">Experts criticize public health England report on E-cigarettes</seg>
<seg id="2">Allegations of a State-funded agency that E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.</seg>
<seg id="3">Experts who write in the British medical journal (BMJ), joined Lancet by criticizing the of public health England (PHE) used evidence in its report on e-cigarettes.</seg>
<seg id="4">PHE in last month published the "policy report" and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".</seg>
<seg id="5">However, some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between experts and the tobacco industry.</seg>
<seg id="6">An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy basis" on the PHE founded his main conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="7">Two other researchers write in BMJ and have wondered whether the claims "based on stone or sand".</seg>
<seg id="8">Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde health at the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness."</seg>
<seg id="9">They said that the public expects, that the claim of PHE, that "The current best estimate is that E-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.</seg>
<seg id="10">In fact, comes this statement from a single session of 12 people, who were called up to be a model for a multiple criteria decision analysis (multi criteria decision analysis - MCDA) to develop, to get their opinions on the harm of nicotine-containing products into a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.</seg>
<seg id="11">McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss health, whose Managing Director before should have benefited American tobacco (BAT) of British for an independent study.</seg>
<seg id="12">He signed the references of the BAT to the public health in a sustainability report, they said.</seg>
<seg id="13">One of the 12 participants in the meeting said that to get funds from an E-cigarette manufacturers but they added not the financing, he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reasons for the selection of members of the Board are not included, but include several well-known E cigarettes champions, of which some specify the paper industry funding.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some other participants in the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.</seg>
<seg id="16">Also the tobacco line of PHE took part in the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="17">The research of group "admits significantly," that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products for most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="19">McKee and Capewell said that were the allegations of PHE, that 'there no evidence so far is that E-cigarettes are used as a way to smoking for children or non-smokers' premature.</seg>
<seg id="20">Prof Kevin Fenton, Director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the allegations of BMJ previously has been responded to.</seg>
<seg id="21">He said: "E-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking."</seg>
<seg id="22">Every second lifelong smoker dies of his addiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">All the evidence suggests that the health risks of E-cigarettes in comparison are low, but that we have continued to study the long-term effects.</seg>
<seg id="24">PHE has a clear duty to inform of the public about what evidence shows and what is not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nearly 80,000 people die every year from a disease related to smoking, and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds a year.</seg>
<seg id="26">By the clear presentation of current evidence that E-cigarettes without risk are, but represent only a fraction of the damage of that is caused by smoking, we meet our national competence.</seg>

<seg id="1">BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4</seg>
<seg id="2">The former Chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop programmes such as EastEnders and the voice send. He said that commercial rivals "her right arm would give" for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.</seg>
<seg id="3">Johnson said that the licence fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which will not be sent by other UK broadcasters.</seg>
<seg id="4">He criticized the BBC for that to place public service programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience, highly controversial window against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said, the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said that he tried for six years during his time at Channel 4 without success to come with the BBC in contact.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends, which would also clearly of non-subsidised rivals," Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee within the framework of his inquiry into the future of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="7">If you want to keep the licence fee, which I in the medium or long term not consider a good idea, you should the others not to make its production at least on programs, or Commission.</seg>
<seg id="8">They send the voice in a prime time, because they want to achieve as broad support for their future.</seg>
<seg id="9">The idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's nonsense, of course.</seg>
<seg id="10">Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funded programs could be financed without subsidies.</seg>
<seg id="11">The voice is such a programme, EastEnders is an another, admittedly both in-house productions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for it.</seg>
<seg id="13">I try to see how this is to be public television.</seg>
<seg id="14">I don't think that this would reduce the BBC at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">Johnson, an entrepreneur for series, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC is to blame in the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people of who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."</seg>
<seg id="16">His comments to the BBC's most popular programmes reflect that the former head of sky, Tony Ball, in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003, suggested that the BBC shows such as EastEnders should sell.</seg>
<seg id="17">Johnson said that the rather public niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can't, measure the audience but they perform their tasks, and they can argue if they on their hypocritical missions to justify 4 billion £ licence fees go,"well, of course, we have created all of these obscure programs that no one has seen.""</seg>
<seg id="18">They put them in a window of time in which no one ever wanted to see her.</seg>
<seg id="19">To the licence fee, Johnson told the Committee: "I urge you to find who can get the best value from it a more regressive system in terms of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="20">Of course, you all think we all think that one for £150 per year here a great value for the 150 gets, but for people, £ is a lot of money, wonder if that's true, because they consume much of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The former sky and channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who testified before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review their Reithian mission "to inform, to make and to entertain".</seg>
<seg id="22">He said little of the BBC production would be classified officially as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and she should take on the public broadcasters in Australia and Canada an example this change to "inform, educate and entertain".</seg>
<seg id="23">On the question of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said that only a handful of TV shows and with commercial channels enter alliances, to make everything available online.</seg>

<seg id="1">'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves</seg>
<seg id="2">The video shows how the nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they are irradiated with sound pulses.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems, which can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tiny nematode change the direction at the moment, in which they have the frequencies too high for the human ear to be heard, are irradiated with pulses of sound.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pulses work by the switching of motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on this topic: researchers read and write brain activity with light</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure, called Sonogenetics, can be used with ultrasound to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.</seg>
<seg id="8">Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the guardian that the procedure one day could replace the deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="9">Nematodes do not respond normally to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did, when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="10">The bubbles, he found out, reinforce the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.</seg>
<seg id="11">The enhanced ultrasound waves effect on structures, the TRP-4 ion channels are called and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report in nature communications.</seg>
<seg id="13">To create ultrasound-controlled nematode, Chalasani changed genetically so that some of their motor neurons TRP-4 ion channels carry the worms.</seg>
<seg id="14">When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves through the micro bubbles are transmitted more and the worms where they turn on the modified motor neurons.</seg>
<seg id="15">The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that enables scientists, neurons with pulses of light on and turn it off.</seg>
<seg id="16">But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.</seg>
<seg id="17">Unlike light that must be revealed to an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain can low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through unhindered tissue and can be sent from the top of the skull into the brain.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasonic signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments", Chalasani said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.</seg>

<seg id="1">Eight golden rules for living in student residences</seg>
<seg id="2">Eleven years ago, I moved as a young 19 year old in a dorm room, still in the belief in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smile of that I have - annoyed and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others.</seg>

<seg id="10">The rooms of people transform venues and communal gathering places often in drinks receptions, movie night, but they are also the places where people get dressed and put her underwear.</seg>
<seg id="11">This involved: not remember to start at the University with a relationship</seg>
<seg id="12">Introverts get rough treatment at the University.</seg>
<seg id="13">Your room should be a refuge, but many student residences form a room to room shopping culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.</seg>
<seg id="14">This can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nothing in the culture allows you to say: "I like you, and I want that our friendship will continue, but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you."</seg>
<seg id="16">Try to feel when a fellow student of socializing is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking.</seg>
<seg id="17">Speaking of knocking: do it.</seg>
<seg id="18">A guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a non-locked door was an invitation.</seg>
<seg id="19">He saw some things.</seg>
<seg id="20">Friendship close by baking.</seg>
<seg id="21">As you begin the University at the peak of the back-mania, the knock on the doors of people is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s to present with a plate of Brownies, "welcome in the neighborhood, I have you baked something. so, and please smile when I ask you some personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="22">To offer homemade treats is a great way to make friends.</seg>
<seg id="23">Her roommate feel obliged to entertain and will associate your face with a tasty morsel at the end of May.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent Baker.</seg>
<seg id="25">Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat cause that people be sleeping when you knock on the door.</seg>
<seg id="26">There is a common crime in student dormitories to steal food.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of course, the claws of chicken is a theft, but it is also taking a drop of Milchs for tea?</seg>
<seg id="28">Check with the owner of the milk.</seg>
<seg id="29">The chances are good that they say to use, even if they cook inside.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone steals your stuff, this is annoying, and you have my sympathy - but try so balanced to deal as my roommate, who added a detergent to their milk to punish thieves.</seg>
<seg id="31">She is now in prison.</seg>
<seg id="32">You should make no noise, which prevents people from sleep or work.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is not simply to be a decent person, but that you are in the truest sense of the proverb to the people, in the glass house sitting.</seg>
<seg id="34">A girl in my Hall asked their neighbors, whether it matters you, drum & bass to put something down because it three o'clock in the morning, and she had in the morning a test.</seg>
<seg id="35">You have responded with even louder music.</seg>
<seg id="36">When they finally stopped at 5 o'clock, she let her neighbors kindly two hours sleep before she all had their own music, completed her door and went to their three-hour exam.</seg>
<seg id="37">Would it not romantic if your future spouse would randomly move into the same dorm?</seg>
<seg id="38">Conversely, it would be not profoundly embarrassing if you keep a roommate for your future spouse, to make them turn back and see every day have to and perhaps see how she pulls across all mutual friends to?</seg>
<seg id="39">Of course, the heart goes its own way - but a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, you at least try to convince your abdomen a little reason.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the exciting moment you notice that someone has leave his keys in his not locked room, the line between a prank and bullying is finer than it seems.</seg>
<seg id="41">A good prank is funny, but it takes only moments until it becomes a boomerang.</seg>
<seg id="42">Give a valuable and fun lesson about security - by hiding but never mess up one's room with toothpaste and shampoo.</seg>
<seg id="43">Lock your door and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but not more than twice down staple their possessions on the ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1">Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low-income earners</seg>
<seg id="2">The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds houses for people who don't have much money in the Middle Franconia corners Valley.</seg>
<seg id="3">So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but also the single mother and the low-wage earners."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I'll show how you can build even today still cheap and good," says the 44-year old in the interview</seg>
<seg id="5">Thousands of refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="6">The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how fast can create more affordable housing: it builds in a project row houses for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="7">Mr Gildner, many refugees are entering the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="8">What solution do you have?</seg>
<seg id="9">Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.</seg>
<seg id="10">Because people stay here to a large extent.</seg>
<seg id="11">In view of the refugee flow, we need sufficient living space in the coming decades.</seg>
<seg id="12">Very simple, three-story townhouse is the solution.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.</seg>
<seg id="14">It facilitates the integration.</seg>
<seg id="15">This is different, bringing among the people in apartment buildings.</seg>
<seg id="16">Each of the six houses of that are built in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="17">Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I will go back.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then, the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.</seg>
<seg id="20">What are the costs?</seg>
<seg id="21">Gildner: The price of 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euro, without land.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is straightforward.</seg>
<seg id="23">The construction took six months.</seg>
<seg id="24">This is appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="25">Have the building regulations complicated their plans?</seg>
<seg id="26">Gildner: Building regulations, I have carried my project correctly.</seg>
<seg id="27">Always the impending threat of special construction and parking regulation makes it very complicated.</seg>
<seg id="28">Creepy.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is still, who creates three apartments in a terraced house, needs at least three pitches.</seg>
<seg id="30">Only in the cities, the place is missing for this.</seg>
<seg id="31">And refugees and asylum seekers have no cars.</seg>
<seg id="32">How did people react to their row House project?</seg>
<seg id="33">Gildner: There, who have accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seekers.</seg>
<seg id="34">What definitely is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="35">But exacerbate not the competition for affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="36">Gildner: Is true: we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years, but were built luxury apartments, which hardly any more can afford.</seg>
<seg id="37">My project has the message, even normal people need housing.</seg>
<seg id="38">Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-wage earners.</seg>
<seg id="39">I will show how you can build even today still cheap and good.</seg>
<seg id="40">That's what.</seg>

<seg id="24">According to the media reports a first bus had arrived at any rate in the morning with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of SID, more buses would be expected in the course of the day.</seg>
<seg id="25">Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany</seg>
<seg id="26">The inmates had been travelling all night from the approximately 500 kilometres away Macedonian border with Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="27">"We have heard that Hungary is permanently closed, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">You wanted to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="29">So it could be actually the shift of the previous Balkans route Turkey Greece Macedonia Serbia Hungary already predicted by observers to a slightly more westerly route.</seg>
<seg id="30">Croatia: "Comprehensive possibilities for border control"</seg>
<seg id="31">Croatia's Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country in the event of a heavy influx of refugees prepared plans for possible emergency situations.</seg>
<seg id="32">He did not name details, he pointed out that Croatia had as a non-Schengen Member "comprehensive possibilities for border control".</seg>
<seg id="33">We perform strict controls, in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is part of the Slovenia since 2007, the EU partners issue since then consistently a good report card the country, concerning the standard of border controls.</seg>
<seg id="35">On the Serbian side continue to about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to Belgrade media reports, they would have spent the last night at the border crossing at Horgos, which leads to Röszke.</seg>
<seg id="37">According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain still completely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="38">Whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Serbian Interior Minister to reassure tried Wednesday morning at a local inspection in Horgos Nebojsa Stefanovic: He thought the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is closed, too early.</seg>
<seg id="40">It would not be currently very high numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="41">You could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.</seg>
<seg id="42">Helper advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes</seg>
<seg id="43">However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already begun to distribute maps, which are alternative routes through Croatia to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="44">Crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is, however, not without danger: in parts of the border area, there is still not always cleared minefields 20 years after the end of the Croatia war.</seg>
<seg id="45">On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team has been sent by mine deminers in the border region.</seg>

<seg id="1">FedEx earnings mixed, reduced financial Outlook for 2016</seg>
<seg id="2">FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the shipping giant lowered its profit Outlook over a year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.</seg>
<seg id="3">The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="4">At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.</seg>
<seg id="5">The stock fell about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">FedEx Corp. said a profit between $10.40 and $10,90 making in the fiscal year that ends next may, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.</seg>
<seg id="7">Analysts were expecting, according to a survey by FactSet $10,84.</seg>
<seg id="8">The lower view comes despite the price increases, which on average amount to 4.9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages that are collected from November.</seg>
<seg id="9">The company said that it still expected earnings compared with the previous year because of cost-cutting, higher revenues and growth in online trading will increase.</seg>
<seg id="10">Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "provides solid returns, given the weaker-than-expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade into account".</seg>
<seg id="11">The plans for the holiday employment were announced one day later than those of rival UPS, who plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the quarter, which ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million $, 6 percent more than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share, the twelve of Zacks investment research, surveyed analysts predicted.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sales rose by 5 percent to 12.3 billion $.</seg>
<seg id="15">Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected 12,23 billion $.</seg>
<seg id="16">FedEx has recorded a decline in the international priority shipping, which brought revenue in its express unit to stagnate in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the boom in online shopping has increased the results with FedEx ground.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the last quarter, sales at the ground transportation by 29 percent, but operating profit was flat due to higher costs for larger packages and auto insurance basically.</seg>
<seg id="19">The express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings due to higher labour costs in the freight business fell.</seg>
<seg id="20">In premarket trading, about an hour before the opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150,15.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Tuesday, they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.</seg>

<seg id="1">At their most anticipated meeting in the year, Federal Reserve spend strategists two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras mahogany table sitting to decide whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.</seg>
<seg id="2">Looming above them at one end of the ornate, two-story meeting room a mural of the United States is.</seg>
<seg id="3">The card is a reminder that the Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Bank has a dual mandate from Congress: maximizing the US employment and prices here hold.</seg>
<seg id="5">But since the great recession the Fed acknowledged leaders that there was an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.</seg>
<seg id="6">And this third mandate could be the X-factor in a decision that is too narrow, it to predict. it is announced on Thursday, whether the U.S. economy is ready to be weaned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.</seg>
<seg id="7">Although most of the data show the economy that she grow steadily, could the recent turmoil in the global financial markets make the already cautious fed representatives anxious to reinforce this volatility by raising the interest rate for government bonds - and be it only by a quarter percentage point.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Obviously the labour market and inflation primarily will be, the most important thing what they observe", said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economist at the broker firm Stifel Nicolaus & co.</seg>
<seg id="9">"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">There is no consensus on what the Fed intends to do, what unsettles to itself the financial market.</seg>
<seg id="11">About half of the economists who were surveyed recently by Bloomberg predicted an interest rate hike this week.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, the financial markets expect a wait for the fed, with a key indicator that displays only a 30% chance to increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists to soften the blow, they pledge that a further increase is far.</seg>
<seg id="14">On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial jumped average by 228,89 points or 1.4% to 16.599,85.</seg>
<seg id="15">The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed's policy maintains the set this week, said John Lonski, Chief Economist at Moody's capital markets research group.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise the rates at this time", he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">If she does, "she would have to go very far in its statement to reassure the financial markets so that they are not panicking."</seg>
<seg id="18">Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Fed is on track to increase, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month seemed to be a month ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expect an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of Liberals, that more economic progress would be required.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.</seg>
<seg id="22">The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% in the last month, the lowest for more than seven years, and in the vicinity of the level, the view the fed as full employment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.</seg>
<seg id="24">And even though inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the Central Bank, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.</seg>
<seg id="25">The economy "can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at the Pantheon of macroeconomics.</seg>
<seg id="26">But the financial markets around the world flashed together late last month, after China had devalued its currency.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Dow Jones industrial average fell in the may by more than 16% below its all-time high, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow down global growth.</seg>
<seg id="28">The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now is up by almost 10% below the high of May.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the representatives of the fed, the market turbulence affect the complex calculation when you should raise interest rates.</seg>
<seg id="30">"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last not occurred few weeks, they would attract the reins at this meeting", said Stephen D. though, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for real estate and a former employee of the U.S. Federal Reserve.</seg>
<seg id="31">Now, he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get a better handle the effects.</seg>
<seg id="32">"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China," said though.</seg>
<seg id="33">None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, therefore she should not involve technically in their decision making.</seg>
<seg id="34">But in the end the Fed monetary authority of the world has become.</seg>
<seg id="35">The influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="36">The mere reference to the former leader Ben S. Bernanke triggered in 2013, that the Fed "could narrow its monetary expansion", confusion around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="37">In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, can be that they monitor not only the developments elsewhere, but consult with other central banks and experts, to provide a better understanding of the global economy expected by the Fed's representative.</seg>
<seg id="38">Their decision making is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for the asset management of Envestnet Inc.</seg>
<seg id="39">Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noticed this month that "the Fed has a history of overreaction to financial market movements with not seem associated with the economic fundamentals."</seg>
<seg id="40">Lacker, a voting member of the Federal open market Committee, de cited decisions in the years 1998/1999 as an example set for an interest rate hike.</seg>
<seg id="41">A financial crisis in Asia led to the fed to reduce its key interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited visible impact on growth in the United States", said Lacker.</seg>
<seg id="42">A year later the Fed representatives made these cuts back.</seg>
<seg id="43">The Fed should aspects of financial stability during a major crisis such as the collapse of the market 2008 first put, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Committee for determining the interest rate the Bank of England.</seg>
<seg id="44">The recent turmoil will not come close to this level, he said.</seg>
<seg id="45">"She will not be certainly the situation, in which she is afraid of an increase in interest, because the markets worry", said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for international economics.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Federal always contains Reserve Act still this double mandate and mentioned the financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think that she should be ahead of time.</seg>

<seg id="2">The situation in the German housing market is tense.</seg>
<seg id="3">More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="4">The pressure on the housing market is growing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Social housing is facing a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">The battles in the German housing market have started long ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU are pushing more and more people on a market which is already overloaded in many major cities.</seg>
<seg id="8">They compete with low-income citizens to the last affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="9">In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, each year, 400,000 new units need to be built by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="10">This result is a study commissioned by the Association Alliance "Social housing".</seg>
<seg id="11">To compare: in this year, 260,000 units are finished in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus, 140,000 homes are missing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial recording accommodation after the first three months of their stay.</seg>
<seg id="14">Many then encounter the housing market and ranks in the long queues in front of the rented accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the Federal Statistical Office, half of all asylum seekers for rent lived less than in the last year.</seg>
<seg id="16">The negative development of the housing market is not only the rising numbers of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="17">The study is also significant omissions in the housing policy of recent years.</seg>
<seg id="18">Germany put a housing deficit before him, which is growing from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="19">Currently, approximately 770,000 units, were missing in the metropolitan areas complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many professionals therefore lived in large cities inevitably in shared rooms.</seg>
<seg id="21">Young adults were due to the downturn in the housing market involuntarily in the "Hotel Mama".</seg>
<seg id="22">In large cities the number of square meters per capita dropped for the first time in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="23">To solve the problem, the Alliance of "Social housing" proposes a reboot.</seg>
<seg id="24">In doing so, new incentives to stimulate social housing again.</seg>
<seg id="25">So could the tax be avoided and are exposed to the real estate tax for subsidized apartments limited.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, attractive tax depreciation allowances are necessary according to the Alliance.</seg>
<seg id="27">The support programme for refugee shelters in the State Bank KfW is now well in cities and towns.</seg>
<seg id="28">A week after starting more than half of the available around 300 million euros had been called off on Monday evening with 184 million euros already.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt</seg>
<seg id="2">The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place where the residents are called show-offs.</seg>
<seg id="3">This property combines some with the billionaire, who wants to become President.</seg>
<seg id="4">Donald Trump (69) is good for excitement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Whether he expressed xenophobic, male goes to journalists or revealed knowledge gaps in the international policy of the crisis – the candidates for the Office of the US President vigorously stirs up the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="6">And good cuts.</seg>
<seg id="7">That is registered in the Palatinate Kallstadt, where the real estate billionaire grandparents come from.</seg>
<seg id="8">The New Yorker with the hair dryer hairstyle is a term for many in the wine-producing village on the wine route.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some on-site 1200 inhabitants is over many corners with it is related.</seg>
<seg id="10">His grandfather came from Kallstadt, Germany: Donald Trump, here in the campaign mode.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Kallstädterin Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.</seg>
<seg id="12">And what do think the villagers about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world?</seg>
<seg id="13">"I think the find this somehow exciting, are but not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadter way", says Simone Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="14">The native Kallstädterin has turned an amusing documentary about the village and its famous offspring, which trump even the ketchup-Heinz family counts.</seg>
<seg id="15">Trump, who is not known for modesty, comes in "Kings of Kallstadt" to speak - so with the statement that he would be surely successful if he lived in Kallstadt (2014).</seg>
<seg id="16">He has not placed it to the King of hearts.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although there was respect for the achievements of the family, but also tend to be the thought that Trump was "already a bit of a big mouth", says Wendel.</seg>
<seg id="18">Coincidentally the nickname noisy, the Kallstadt in the vicinity, "The Brulljesmacher" - to high German: she says the blowhard.</seg>
<seg id="19">Trump is from the village of show-offs.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Trump'sche success story began in 1885, when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a place for gold miners in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="21">First land purchases in New York were a cornerstone of the real estate company.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the lives of grandparents was not without tragedy: your desire to return permanently to the home, failed due to the Bavarian State, to which the Palatinate then belonged.</seg>
<seg id="23">He had not included Trump because he was once left without permission, said the Director of the Institute of Palatinate history and folklore, Roland Paul, to the film's release.</seg>
<seg id="24">Trump was the grandson of "illegal immigrant".</seg>
<seg id="25">This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendants.</seg>
<seg id="26">He had repeatedly disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="27">"So as the rumbles, it is not so nice," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of trumps ("grandma was a born Trump, Grandpa was born Heinz").</seg>
<seg id="28">The winemaker in retirement sees rather distant from the Americans, "he is always so short-tempered".</seg>
<seg id="29">Does he believe that Trump come?</seg>
<seg id="30">"I can not imagine that", says the 72.</seg>
<seg id="31">"He never cared about Kallstadt".</seg>
<seg id="32">The boarding house landlady Veronika Schramm as some Kallstadter mentioned that a descendant of the family Heinz when visiting donated something for the church organ, which was generally well received.</seg>
<seg id="33">"I can not imagine that of the Donald" says the 68.</seg>
<seg id="34">It would be better if he could not win the election, because "has such radical views, I don't know if that's good".</seg>
<seg id="35">If those who were in charge at the time of his grandfather in the United States, would have been so like him, "he would have never reached".</seg>
<seg id="36">"There are more interesting subjects than him," says Winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.</seg>
<seg id="37">And as President?</seg>
<seg id="38">"My President is not Yes" she says.</seg>
<seg id="39">And: "The grapes are ripe without the Trump of President of".</seg>
<seg id="40">12 000 filmgoers have seen Wendel movie for the Trump was interviewed long, also in the United States, the interest awakened.</seg>

<seg id="3">But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.</seg>
<seg id="4">Some trainers would have banned Hayne for the rest of the game on the bench, when he so lost a tussle, the Aussie Rugby League convert did with his first punt-return on Tuesday when the 20-3 win over Minnesota.</seg>

<seg id="1">For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery may be helpful.</seg>
<seg id="2">The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years according to a new study.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non-surgical treatments.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The mortality data need a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert of weight loss surgery, wrote of an editorial to the new study in JAMA surgery.</seg>
<seg id="5">Weight loss surgery or weight loss surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="6">They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.</seg>
<seg id="7">Over the years, obesity surgery for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.</seg>
<seg id="8">BMI, a measure of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.</seg>
<seg id="9">A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 is considered to be obese.</seg>
<seg id="10">You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng used general hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare these two types of obesity surgery - gastric bypass and gastric tube formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight.</seg>
<seg id="12">The average BMI among those undergoing this operation fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.</seg>
<seg id="13">Meanwhile, the BMI for those receiving non-surgical treatments of diabetes about the same at 29 remained.</seg>
<seg id="14">Among those undergoing a surgical procedure, the diabetes disease broke up completely and 28% partly at 36%.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the medical treatment group diabetes fully only at one percent, and with only about two percent was in comparison.</seg>
<seg id="16">In addition, the results in the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were "Generally better in the 'surgical' group", found the authors.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers monitored also the patients blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.</seg>
<seg id="18">Hemoglobin A1c the best below 7 percent is held, write the researchers.</seg>
<seg id="19">After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased level of around 9 per cent to about 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this better "glycemic control" – as the improved hemoglobin A1c level is reflected in you - not the mortality was reduced in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-cheng Hsu and his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="22">The research team compared the average results for the two types of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group compared to the Gastrectomy Group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), reached larger declines in the BMI (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).</seg>
<seg id="24">While the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden, that operation leads to a longer life, says Blackstone from the University of Arizona, College of medicine Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the Swedish study, it was in obese people who underwent obesity surgery likely to die about 29 percent - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods in the course of 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although the new study showed no benefit for the survival in surgery patients, said Blackstone, it is reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the process.</seg>
<seg id="27">"This is the critical point of this study, because it says that this operation in this lower BMI group is lower," without increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">Blackstone added that people and their doctors should begin seriously to take weight, as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I think that we can wait too long until we encourage people to take this seriously," she said.</seg>
<seg id="30">"I think that as soon as they have accumulated genetic changes, which have tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard."</seg>

<seg id="2">Poison control centers in the United States report a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 who swallow strongly alcoholic disinfectant, so the Georgia Poison Center.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, Director of the Georgia Poison Center, increased the cases of revenue of hand Sanitizer for children under 12 years, poison control centers report, 3,266 in 2010 on 16.117 in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Children are the increase in these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that some children deliberately drinking disinfectant, while some are doing it to impress their friends or because of a dare in social media.</seg>
<seg id="6">YouTube videos show how young people drinking disinfectant only because a cheap experience.</seg>
<seg id="7">Young people have allegedly mixed disinfectant with benzene mouthwash to get a harder drink.</seg>
<seg id="8">Younger children can be lured by attractive aromas of disinfectant.</seg>
<seg id="9">"A child doesn't think that this is bad for it," Lopez said.</seg>
<seg id="10">Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectant) are those that are scented.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are disinfectant with Strawberry, grape and orange scent, which are very appealing for children.</seg>
<seg id="12">Disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particularly in young children, a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning.</seg>
<seg id="14">"It's highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, Medical Director of the poison emergency call center at the Hospital of the University of Kansas, the Fox 4 in Kansa city.</seg>
<seg id="15">So, you would leave no SIP whisky standing around, but people let this hand disinfectant within reach of children, and when children come in, then it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="16">Nhaijah Russell, a six-year girl who recently had taken four splashes of after Strawberry scented disinfectant in the school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which applies in an adult by law as a drunk, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated them at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nhaijah slurred her words and was not able to go, when she arrived in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="19">Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate hospital for children for signs of brain injury, because it had fallen girls by alcohol and himself had bumped his head, Ritchey said.</seg>
<seg id="20">"It was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijahs mother, CNN.</seg>
<seg id="21">It could be fatal for my child.</seg>
<seg id="22">Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant wipes and store disinfectants out of reach of the child.</seg>
<seg id="23">About alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants with deaths were connected.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the year 2013, two women in Ontario died women after swallowing of hand disinfectant, which contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="25">Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="26">In January three students in the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison her "mean" teacher, by they interpreted antibacterial products for the classroom", as it reports a police report.</seg>
<seg id="27">The teacher is highly allergic to disinfectants and banished her from her room.</seg>
<seg id="28">The police saw the foiled plan as "Chatter" and referred to disciplinary action to the School Board.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why I will be witness to an execution in Oklahoma</seg>
<seg id="2">Something later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will to see how a man is put to death.</seg>
<seg id="3">When it happens, and I hope that it does not happen, I will sit in a spectator Gallery in the death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.</seg>
<seg id="4">He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.</seg>
<seg id="5">The invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.</seg>
<seg id="6">As the day neared, I began to fear me.</seg>
<seg id="7">So, why should I do it?</seg>
<seg id="8">I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="9">It would offer a unique perspective.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the United States, and as more applications than places available, a macabre Lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="11">Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.</seg>
<seg id="12">Who is selected, which will monitor it emotionless.</seg>
<seg id="13">I can't do that.</seg>
<seg id="14">I will sit next to Richard Glossips close friend, with whom I developed my own relationship in the months with phone calls and a visit to two and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id="15">I like the guy.</seg>
<seg id="16">We laugh often much when we talk.</seg>
<seg id="17">The prison authorities say that I may be not a witness and a journalist, so it will be me not allowed to bring a notebook and a pen, to record what I see.</seg>
<seg id="18">I must just try to remember all the details.</seg>
<seg id="19">A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, to give up my impartiality.</seg>
<seg id="20">Here is the lesson.</seg>
<seg id="21">Tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and get access.</seg>
<seg id="22">I complained to her.</seg>
<seg id="23">She admitted that she "would have to put better it", but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Richard Glossip had problem with some of the things I've said and written.</seg>
<seg id="25">He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it, even if he would do it.</seg>
<seg id="26">I told him that he can at any time remove me from his list of witnesses.</seg>
<seg id="27">But he wants that an international reporter is present there to write.</seg>
<seg id="28">When he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kim portraits ware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.</seg>
<seg id="30">If you want to know more about the case, you hear the series of podcasts that I made.</seg>
<seg id="31">I will not turn on all the details.</seg>
<seg id="32">I can not say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.</seg>
<seg id="33">His actions would make him guilty for the murder of Barry Van Treese to be a beneficiary of the Act.</seg>
<seg id="34">But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is guilty not of murder.</seg>
<seg id="35">I sure think that there was not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="36">I believe that his execution is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="37">And from that perspective, I will see him die.</seg>
<seg id="38">I cannot claim to be really objective.</seg>
<seg id="39">There will be other reporters, which you can use for this.</seg>
<seg id="40">What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.</seg>

<seg id="3">Sydney roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed "Wrestling" the storm players with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly-veiled remark to the storm team, his team reached the final victory against the North Queensland cowboys on Saturday night had. He called the game a "perfect example" of Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in wrestling.</seg>
<seg id="5">Bellamy defended the Tacklimg of his team and said that they were focused only on their "contact us" at the tackling.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team confident voice him because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the storm team.</seg>
<seg id="7">On Wednesday, "that appears again and again - I haven't heard that Trent spoke Robinson about wrestling matches when they beat us 2-24," said Bellamy.</seg>
<seg id="8">I can guarantee that we changed have. but nothing on our defensive system or the techniques in the whole year in the last six weeks, we have made our contact in tackles a real priority, and which has yielded the turnaround for us.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trent has been there three years, and he obviously has a great team to train he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing, so was it a bit of a shock to him.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's funny how this keeps popping up at this time of year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Bellamy has attacked Bennett's idea of the "exciting football" and his mentor recalled that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.</seg>
<seg id="12">Wayne speaks of exciting football.</seg>
<seg id="13">"He has his game on Friday night compared with our on Saturday night and their game was exciting", Bellamy said.</seg>
<seg id="14">I remember that in the year 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said that he will take a shit about.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially its young players with their speed.</seg>
<seg id="16">That's the ball game you want to play when you have these kind of players.</seg>
<seg id="17">He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all of his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.</seg>
<seg id="18">I build confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us.</seg>
<seg id="19">Six weeks ago they have not thought to us when it comes to the big games.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bellamy also noted that the game storm against the roosters scored a higher score than the Broncos game against Cowboys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I have not seen it yet, but what was the result? 16: 12?</seg>
<seg id="22">Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is an exciting game?</seg>
<seg id="23">Or breaks make and no points something exciting?</seg>
<seg id="24">The game plans are for me.</seg>
<seg id="25">If you mention us, it means that we will meet in a period still on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Angela Merkel and refugee policy: "we do it"</seg>
<seg id="2">The influx of refugees is an enormous challenge – the Chancellor is determined to accept them.</seg>
<seg id="3">What to expect in Germany?</seg>
<seg id="4">Around 800 000 asylum seekers will be according to projections of the Federal Ministry of the Interior in Germany this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) is Germany able to absorb one million refugees.</seg>
<seg id="5">German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination given the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: we can do this, and we can do it".</seg>
<seg id="6">The following overview provides what to expect Germany.</seg>
<seg id="7">Apartments are needed according to different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institute) per year - and the next five years.</seg>
<seg id="8">That's almost twice as much, built as before (250000 apartments).</seg>
<seg id="9">The lack of housing in affordable rental properties is dramatic: every year 60000 to 80000 social housing from the rent controls fall out, and these discounted apartments will apply for refugees.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore, Federal Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="11">Is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housing units per year would have to emerge and that the Federal Government would have to invest funding amounting to 6.4 billion a year.</seg>
<seg id="12">Scientists and federal Bauministerin agree, that there should be more tax benefits for investment in housing.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Institute for labour market and occupational research, it is assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be gainfully employed in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="14">However, the refugees would not systematically criticized asked in Germany after their qualifications to help them get started, Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="15">For the integration of refugees is vital if they find work in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="16">Work is the key to social contacts, for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="17">In Germany, there has been a change in policy according to Thränhardt: from the work ban for refugees to the recognition of work.</seg>
<seg id="18">While there was a work ban on asylum seekers of up to five years, this was limited, in November 2014 to three months as well as the residence requirement, asylum seekers on a place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="19">The view has prevailed in society - also due to the lack of skilled workers - the majority, that faster access to the labour market should enable refugees.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lack knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market.</seg>
<seg id="21">So far, there is no sufficient offer of General and professional language courses.</seg>
<seg id="22">Research also shows that jobs are most often conveyed through personal contacts.</seg>
<seg id="23">Networking is the best way to work integration according to Thränhardt.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Berlin school administration has determined that only a few refugees parents give their children in the day-care centres, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the rootless parents, it is only once very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.</seg>
<seg id="25">In order to convince the family of the benefits of the daycare center, the Administration distributed handouts in different languages.</seg>
<seg id="26">Should the need for teachers by the large number of refugees to rise, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - about, by allowing more technical schools.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the countries, students without knowledge of German in welcome classes are prepared for teaching.</seg>
<seg id="28">You are taught but not always by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also of teachers, who have only a qualification in German as a second language.</seg>
<seg id="29">Them there is no lack of, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.</seg>
<seg id="30">The German Student Association estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.</seg>
<seg id="31">In principle, no State prohibits the study of asylum seekers or tolerated - Berlin was the only exception so far, Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) but gave up his stance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Access to the University could be facilitated study willing refugees.</seg>
<seg id="33">For refugees with a residence permit or condoning get no benefits according to the laws, when they start studying.</seg>
<seg id="34">The latter have basically no student loans, as they fall outside the circle of bafögberechtigten persons.</seg>
<seg id="35">Tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany in order to be eligible for student loans, so far four years from January 1, 2016 shortened to this margin to 15 months.</seg>
<seg id="36">This funding gap must be closed but, call noise, Berlin's State Secretary for science, and the German Studentenwerk Steffen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Students should immediately get student loans.</seg>
<seg id="38">Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.</seg>
<seg id="39">The State should gradually the same rights give Islam as they have the churches, and further develop the existing State Church law to a new state religions ratio.</seg>
<seg id="40">The establishment of an Islamic Welfare Association, who take professional care of the newcomers would be important.</seg>
<seg id="41">The rights include responsibilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">Must agree the representatives of Islam on a clear point of contact and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him some control.</seg>
<seg id="43">This includes the willingness to act boldly against religious fundamentalism.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday, religious conflict could be brought to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="45">Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have forfeited immediately their right to stay, here in Germany," he said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="46">He proposed to translate the basic law in Arabic.</seg>
<seg id="47">Integration will in the future much more than today to be a theme of the society as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="48">This is also the majority society must change, the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing.</seg>
<seg id="49">Although Germany has - as a result of European decisions – for a decade on a tight a federal agency and a general equality law.</seg>
<seg id="50">But as the NSU murders showed in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive learns very slowly.</seg>
<seg id="51">Equal opportunities for all: what migrant organisations and the non-white German interest groups long demand and why international agreements such as the Convention against racism oblige Germany, must become a reality in the next few years, when the country remain peaceful and its new citizens to use their facilities for the benefit of all.</seg>
<seg id="52">In General, Germany is able to provide the previously expected refugees, medical doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery said.</seg>
<seg id="53">"We create with regard to man power and capacity,", he told the Tagesspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="54">However, additional money into the system must flow for it.</seg>
<seg id="55">To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls immediately upon registration health cards to hand over all comers.</seg>
<seg id="56">Services could be charged later with the Federal States.</seg>
<seg id="57">And in the long term, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited range of services, which provides the laws.</seg>
<seg id="58">Otherwise, above all the language barriers to make the doctors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Already, so the Berlin health scientist has demonstrated Thea Borde, migrants are worse about their illnesses enlightened than other patients.</seg>
<seg id="60">Not only in hospitals, including medical practices interpreter costs would have to be taken over, it demands.</seg>
<seg id="61">Many refugees already with more general focal points in the emergency care would help.</seg>
<seg id="62">And with another diagnostic view.</seg>
<seg id="63">There's significantly more untreated disability among refugee children about, and young people is about HIV education.</seg>
<seg id="64">German doctors from their training would be clear but with different syndromes, says Montgomery.</seg>
<seg id="65">"Parasites or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect". and with regard to the shortage of doctors, whether the refugees even relief in sight.</seg>
<seg id="66">The Syrians have a highly developed education system, many refugees are even doctors.</seg>
<seg id="67">In order to be able to practice, they would have to prove their qualification however, and may again take examinations.</seg>
<seg id="68">At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is mentally ill according to the Federal Chamber of psychotherapist (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.</seg>
<seg id="69">Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK explains refugee children, are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="70">A recent study at the TU Munich proves that five Syrian refugee children traumatized is on in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="71">Who is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, among other things, suffers from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations, and fear of death.</seg>
<seg id="72">Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe irritability and emotional numbness.</seg>
<seg id="73">Early treatment is necessary, to prevent that the symptoms were chronic, Munz said.</seg>
<seg id="74">So far, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="75">Although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social services may submit a request for psychotherapy, but does it take for several months to the process.</seg>
<seg id="76">Also mostly officers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness, would decide in the social services, whether or not treatment is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="77">This would often lead to misjudgments, says Munz.</seg>

<seg id="1">FC arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates must be ahead of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere</seg>
<seg id="2">Wenger compared Wilshere to stressed that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="3">This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England, and given its history, its participation is still uncertain in the next summer at the European Championships.</seg>
<seg id="4">The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere after a separate ankle injury had finished last season strongly, and then back to his old swing had returned during the previous season.</seg>
<seg id="5">"This kind of injury threatened not the career," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is a bone that is not well healed.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is not a major issue.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was just an accident.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was in conjunction with his ankles or the injuries that he had before.</seg>
<seg id="10">That may be true from a purely medical standpoint, but as Wenger also recognized, there are the associated risk of further injury, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.</seg>
<seg id="11">It developed also an unpleasant pattern.</seg>
<seg id="12">The study of Premier injuries Ltd has 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="13">He played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 League games in the last five seasons.</seg>
<seg id="14">The broader picture for arsenal is that they Premier were League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007/08 of one of the two, which have recorded the most days of the injury.</seg>
<seg id="15">Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury will continue during the last season.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time in which you strengthen your body and have to win power", said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="17">Jack is young enough to overcome that.</seg>
<seg id="18">I hope his body is stabilized, I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves.</seg>
<seg id="19">Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and Wenger is a rotation within the team.</seg>
<seg id="20">Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.</seg>
<seg id="21">Wenger can begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.</seg>
<seg id="22">"I try to keep the balance and to treat those who need it, a small breather," Wenger said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Although arsenal are favourites to progress from Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dynamo is undefeated after 41 games, after the "Invincible" campaign was launched in the last season.</seg>
<seg id="25">On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by an earthquake, which measured 3.2 on the Richter scale.</seg>
<seg id="26">It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.</seg>
<seg id="27">Wenger believes that arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope to lead the Club to its first European Cup triumph with its management.</seg>
<seg id="28">"This drive is immense," said Wenger.</seg>
<seg id="29">It has never worked for arsenal.</seg>
<seg id="30">We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm long enough in business to be realistic.</seg>
<seg id="31">We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.</seg>

<seg id="1">FriendsFest: the comedy show which gives us serious lessons about male</seg>
<seg id="2">The absence of similar appearances in shows is obvious, especially in noting how the need for men to open up, has become now more desperate than ever, how to prove suicide rates among young men on a 15-year high.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2013, it was the most important cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it is three times more common in men than in women.</seg>
<seg id="4">In an effort to tackle the problem, the campaign against living miserably (CALM - campaign against a pitiful life) announced 2015 as the year of the man, with the aim to put culture in question prevents the men to seek help when they need it.</seg>
<seg id="5">Friendship is the heart in the fight to address this challenge.</seg>
<seg id="6">A recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms noted that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of friends with "healthy mood", his chances of recovery doubled.</seg>
<seg id="7">For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends cut in half the risk of mental health problems.</seg>
<seg id="8">But of course you must first of all have friends make a friendship work.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the age of communication through social media, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediacy of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact.</seg>
<seg id="10">Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, although in reality dominated the isolation.</seg>
<seg id="11">This superficial success is dominated by the, what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper effect on our mental health.</seg>
<seg id="12">And a video game inventor and billionaire recently said that money can't buy really good luck.</seg>
<seg id="13">The nice thing about friends was that this focus on the head was placed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Each character is defined by his work, but because of his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.</seg>
<seg id="15">The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, moments of football watching in comfortable armchairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came from knowing that men may relate to in any case, to explore their feelings even if they often hold back completely.</seg>
<seg id="16">As an employee of the telephone emergency service explained it to me:... "my listener role for people who feel depressed and suicidal, really clearly showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."</seg>
<seg id="17">The men who contact us often do not feel able to talk to friends.</seg>
<seg id="18">The old saying "I get along this" has a tremendous effect, such as the fact that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems."</seg>
<seg id="19">Friends is one of the shows of that comes to my mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="20">It clearly presents the small moments of male.</seg>
<seg id="21">So my objective outsider status over the phone also may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so, when you visit Comedy Central FriendsFest with the scenery completely redesigned to celebrate this weekend, then why take your friends for a drink in the Central Perk.</seg>
<seg id="23">Or, even better, if you see sitting around someone alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.</seg>
<seg id="24">You never know what difference could make your friendship.</seg>
<seg id="25">Friends will be sent on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest</seg>

<seg id="1">Di Maria will meet to help PSG crush Malmö</seg>
<seg id="2">Angel Di Maria celebrates after his goal against Malmö with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson CAVANI.</seg>
<seg id="3">Di Maria meets on his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and PSG helps to pass on Malmö.</seg>
<seg id="4">Here are the report and the reaction to the game.</seg>
<seg id="5">Angel Di Maria and Edinson CAVANI held course, as Paris Saint-Germain its Champions League season with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö in the Parc des Princes Stadium started on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="6">Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French champions on the way, but then they missed a number of opportunities before they finally increased their lead when CAVANI scored a header in the 61st minute.</seg>
<seg id="7">With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris needs as they strive not only qualifying for the knockout rounds, a strong start against the Swedish master, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="8">But while they got the points, it was not a class game by Laurent Blanc team with Zlatan Ibrahimovics missed chances before the goal he was later in the game against his hometown team and the Club, with whom he already began his illustrious career in 1999, replaced.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It's not easy, at home or abroad in the Champions League to win. so it is a good start to win 2-0, to cause problems for our opponents and relaxed look back, even though there are certain things that we still need to perfect in the course of the season," Blanc said.</seg>
<seg id="10">"That's a good sign.</seg>
<seg id="11">"We wanted to win and we have won, although I regret that we do not have scored one or two more goals."</seg>
<seg id="12">Ibrahimovic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team held a 2-2 draw on its own course against Bordeaux in the first division at the weekend, but he was cut out by di Maria in the fourth minute.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Argentine winger was known as the man can take the PSG to the next level in Europe, when he in the last month from Manchester United was taken over, and he hinted why, when he in Marco Verrattis pass behind the Malmo defense ran into it before finishing at Johan Wiland along nicely in the corner of the net.</seg>
<seg id="14">If, however, someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, was disappointed.</seg>
<seg id="15">Malmö, which beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this stage, participated in Anpiff with nine players on the field and was a difficult opponent lined up with a five-man defense and two deep in the midfield.</seg>
<seg id="16">But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, Trapps post passed to Kevin in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Instead PSG was on himself sometimes, with some wayward and bad accounts, not least by Ibrahimovic which Championship no less than five attempts in the first half and then abandoned after CAVANI had used it after the restart.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless he proved much more skill, when he brought his team-mates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, the Di Maria is transformed into a ball, which past directed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the post...</seg>
<seg id="19">The second goal was finally shortly after the hour mark thanks to CAVANI. the Uruguayans scored his sixth goal of the season so, after Ibrahimovic had fished on a left flank of Maxwell.</seg>
<seg id="20">That ended all thoughts that Malmö could come back into the game, and only excellent intervention of Wiland from a very short distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the end result, before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi was stripped of a gate at the end.</seg>
<seg id="21">The coach of Malmö, age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class above his team, and the Norwegians said: "our last Champions League was game in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="22">Since then, we have played only in the Swedish League, which has the same level of.</seg>
<seg id="23">The qualifiers are not sufficient".</seg>
<seg id="24">Hats off to Paris!</seg>
<seg id="25">It was a great game of them!</seg>

<seg id="1">Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible</seg>
<seg id="2">Jesus with the (gilded) the Crown of thorns is one of the major works, painted by Otmar Alt for his Bible.</seg>
<seg id="3">Klaus senior post has written the introduction and updated texts of the Bible.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the beginning was the word?</seg>
<seg id="5">No, not with the Otmar ALT Bible, which now appeared with splendid images.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who has formulated his own interpretations of Biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 subjects.</seg>
<seg id="7">The 75-year old has received his "language" with bright colours and imaginative shapes - which is by no means synonymous with "funny" pictures.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the contrary: the respective topics adapted can have a quite quite bleak.</seg>
<seg id="9">Three years, Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".</seg>
<seg id="10">Cycles, which are dedicated to topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, bids, or Lord's prayer were created.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus he has fascinated spontaneously several partners: This applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its focus on art books.</seg>
<seg id="12">And especially the author Klaus senior post, which dealt with the respective places of the Bible based on the painting.</seg>
<seg id="13">He has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Otmar Alt and so today, in the current context "translated into".</seg>
<seg id="14">These texts are like verbal mirror of old painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">They are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and each set of the artist of who formulated his own personal thoughts on the situation here.</seg>
<seg id="16">The cover of jewelry has golden letters.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thus the 75th allows a deep insight into his soul, his emotions double.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is a high level of intimacy.</seg>
<seg id="19">Emotions were ultimately ever trigger for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, 1940 in New York City born and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Church order.</seg>
<seg id="20">"As the education happened already with the cane", recalls Otmar Alt.</seg>
<seg id="21">"I've tried to work this might again get me along with the father".</seg>
<seg id="22">His second concern was to restore the art to more important in fast-moving time: "the perception of imagery is today characterized by advertising, and is noisy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Symbolism is as displaced.</seg>
<seg id="24">Artists have a different pleasure and delight to show things.</seg>
<seg id="25">Images have always something mysterious and not decorative.</seg>
<seg id="26">"In this respect, I am a dinosaur".</seg>
<seg id="27">Otmar Alt wants to, discover that the viewer into the pictures "fall into", they let on, and feel what power they have: "The image is looking his counterpart".</seg>
<seg id="28">Klaus senior post admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar ALT Bible in the Otmar ALT Foundation, "has always been" a lover of Otmar ALTs art to have been: "I like how he sees life with his paintings".</seg>
<seg id="29">Old did not care fully to capture the Bible, but important, even mysterious themes selected for him.</seg>
<seg id="30">Alte post "That was no cooperation at eye level," says: "this is the images, the text explains only". a picture Bible was created.</seg>
<seg id="31">For Hans Möhler by Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation "to deepen his life and find freedom".</seg>
<seg id="32">Otmar ALTs images speak the (Biblical) language of love as well as the responsibility for Möhler.</seg>
<seg id="33">A part of the original paper and canvas images - will be presented in an exhibition, which opens on November 15 in the Otmar ALT Foundation.</seg>

<seg id="24">The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have spent is lived in football.</seg>
<seg id="25">"This is of enormous importance," he said.</seg>
<seg id="26">In this and the next year, the Association together with the DFB-selection and the Federal Government will provide 300 000 EUR for the integration of refugees.</seg>

<seg id="4">Dobrindt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the IAA auto show of a "new age of mobility".</seg>
<seg id="5">Automated and networked driving will improve road safety and congestion, said Dobrindt.</seg>
<seg id="6">He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, which come together with representatives of the industry at the Frankfurt Motor Show.</seg>
<seg id="7">The strategy paper of the Ministry of transport stresses the importance of the mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.</seg>
<seg id="8">A test track on the Highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being built for the testing of new technology.</seg>
<seg id="9">So that the driver "no additional liability risks imposed be", wants the Federal Government the legal framework "review and, where necessary, adapt to new developments".</seg>
<seg id="10">So Germany will advocate as internationally, increase the speed limit for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Federal Government wants to support also a change of the Vienna Convention, which provides for only the people as a driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">When automated driving the car takes the lead in increasing, more and more the driver to the passenger.</seg>
<seg id="13">The technology is based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.</seg>
<seg id="14">According to a study presented by the Ministry of economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="15">Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads were "until well after 2020 to be expected".</seg>
<seg id="16">The authors of the study for 2025 to around 8.4 billion euros will appreciate the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">"Can the digital networking of the car to the increased safety and efficiency in road transport lead", the transport politician Sören Bartol said.</seg>
<seg id="18">The issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly understood.</seg>
<seg id="19">Still, the Germans see self-driving cars sceptical - much more than French or Americans.</seg>
<seg id="20">A survey presented on Wednesday to the AA of the Forsa Institute on behalf of the DEKRA testing organisation comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars over the next ten years will prevail, 32 percent believe only in 20 years, 31 percent believe it at all.</seg>
<seg id="21">In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33 percent by 2025 with self-driving cars in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="22">Anyway, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-propelled vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to a survey of the digital Association BITKOM, only seven percent would agree to relinquish control during the entire journey on all roads.</seg>
<seg id="24">On the Highway 15 percent could imagine in traffic anyway, in a traffic jam 45 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">Every fourth car would leave control under any circumstances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible</seg>
<seg id="2">It is a mixture of great fashion show and a waxworks horror: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) on Wednesday in Munich an exhibition of his work presented.</seg>
<seg id="3">The highlights: mannequins, which look frighteningly human thanks to video projections.</seg>
<seg id="4">You wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, which among other things, with Madonna's stage outfits to the big star who became fashion scene – and that he put men in skirts.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I can no longer say that I'm terrible of Haute Couture the enfant because I have white hair."</seg>
<seg id="6">"It used to be bleached, it's real," said Gaultier.</seg>
<seg id="7">For the visitors of the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which is from the 18th September at the Kunsthalle of the hypo Cultural Foundation, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed its initial opposition to a show about his person.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was actually against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">If you die, you get into the Museum.</seg>
<seg id="10">The impressive collection had made previously in Montreal, Canada and Paris station.</seg>
<seg id="11">"It's so much more than just nice clothes," said the Director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.</seg>
<seg id="13">The exhibits give an insight in the work of the man of who has made fashion history, without ever having completed training to overlooking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Chronologically, the show is not established, but it is a perfectly choreographed piece of art for much effort: to style the dolls, a stylist was hired for specially.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the curator Loriot of maxim of Thierry, 14 tons of material have carted the makers to Munich.</seg>
<seg id="16">Just before the start of the Oktoberfest was still a special treat: a leather trousers outfit with corset.</seg>
<seg id="17">Heidi meets Madonna.</seg>
<seg id="18">He interested himself for strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="19">Horse animal's old Teddy can be seen in the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="20">It stands for the first, tentative fashionable steps of the designer.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a child (he was not a good student and poor in football) he attracted bras and dresses his teddy, Gaultier said.</seg>
<seg id="22">His parents were not allowed to play with a doll.</seg>
<seg id="23">He taught later even the design of fashion itself.</seg>
<seg id="24">He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Later I bought the but of course.</seg>
<seg id="26">For his first own fashion show, he did not pay the models.</seg>
<seg id="27">They got nothing, but were allowed to keep the clothes.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauen lace as a fashion niche</seg>
<seg id="2">Earlier it wanted on the long embroidery machines in and around Plauen to meters.</seg>
<seg id="3">The embroidered fabrics and lace were built in large quantities for customers who processed it to blankets and curtains.</seg>
<seg id="4">That alone no longer, explained Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the fashion tip of Plauen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Instead, the fashion is important again.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the early days of the Plauen lace fashion played a major role, was then replaced by the home textile industry - and now is being rediscovered as a niche.</seg>
<seg id="7">Reinhardt cited some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional costumes.</seg>
<seg id="8">Even the so-called vintage clothing, similar to past eras, make a growing job potential.</seg>
<seg id="9">Who uses any niches in the textile industry in Germany, is no longer on the market.</seg>
<seg id="10">With us they account for half of all orders.</seg>
<seg id="11">Fashion tip Plauen along with nine other companies is a member of the industry association of Plauen lace and embroidery.</seg>
<seg id="12">They may carry the protected label.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales were broken off.</seg>
<seg id="14">There are almost no longer private shops and also wholesale.</seg>
<seg id="15">Our products reach the customer in this way hardly.</seg>
<seg id="16">The mass-produced will today much more cheaply produced in Asia and sold almost exclusively through chains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also schwächle the export, currently in the United States and Russia.</seg>
<seg id="18">Plenty of reasons for new ways.</seg>
<seg id="19">Industry Association tries to score as Cordula Bauer of the embroidery bead in Falkenstein explained through environmental awareness: "Since this year, we have a quality seal, which shows that we produce ecologically and socially acceptable".</seg>
<seg id="20">Reinhardt added: "This refers to the materials used".</seg>
<seg id="21">Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger branch of the Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of applied arts - and is specialized in embroidery and lace.</seg>
<seg id="22">To counter the competition from Asia, we must find high-quality and innovative products.</seg>
<seg id="23">That takes time and courage.</seg>
<seg id="24">"There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies need to think above all, economically," says Schmidt.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, an existing design will often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.</seg>
<seg id="26">A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.</seg>
<seg id="27">In doing so, the machine in some places embroiders small beads.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Plauener goldsmiths champion Bianca Hall Bach Krauße was inspired: "Before I could do anything with traditional Plauen lace".</seg>
<seg id="29">Now use the snowball tip for her jewelry.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a complex procedure, it shapes the pattern in silver.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old", says Reuter.</seg>
<seg id="32">It provides in the United States, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose driving out in Plauen and the surrounding area have lived and who want a souvenir.</seg>
<seg id="33">So I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of Plauen lace.</seg>

<seg id="2">The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and the consumers expect a much higher dose of the case.</seg>
<seg id="3">The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which there is a corresponding working document of the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "risks and side effects of misguided industrial policy and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant women and young children", explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.</seg>
<seg id="4">Wolfschmidt according to the limits of the nerve for big fish should be raised at the end of the food chain like about shark or swordfish for "economic reasons" of one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.</seg>
<seg id="5">Large predatory fish are contaminated with mercury that 50 percent of catches cannot be sold on the basis of the force limits about but already today as strong.</seg>
<seg id="6">After doubling the limit values, then only 14.5 percent were not for sale.</seg>
<seg id="7">In return for this relaxation of the EU according to Foodwatch wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="8">Foodwatch called this but "Trick", because smaller coarse, like about carp usually as low charged, that they already comply with the planned maximum levels.</seg>
<seg id="9">The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion, that alone helps the economy", said Wolfschmidt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mercury is a highly toxic for the human heavy metal which greatly accumulates through the food chain, especially in predatory fish.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore the Federal Government warns that "even small amounts especially in unborn damage of the nervous system" can cause.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Federal Environment Ministry declared on its website in terms of the existing maximum levels, but that a "health threat to the general population" is not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mercury passes mainly through the coal combustion in the environment.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German coal-fired plants bear buck more than six tons emit mercury according to a written report of the Federal Ministry of environment to the Green Member of Parliament Anna Lena in the year, two-thirds of the total emitted in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="15">The concentration of mercury in fish around in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube is "permanent and nationwide exceeded", had quoted in the March from the paper "The mirror".</seg>
<seg id="16">Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.</seg>
