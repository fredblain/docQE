"Sono Genetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the Nematoden change direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound.
Scientists have gezüchtet Würmer genetisch modified nervous systems that can be controlled by Ausbrüchen by sound waves.
The tiny Nematoden change the direction at the moment they are bestrahlt Impulsen with sound frequencies that are too high for the human ear to be heard.
The stimulus work by Einschalten Moto Neuron cells genetisch be changed, in order to take the Membran channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.

The researchers said that Würmer showed the power of a new procedure called sono Genetics at Ultraschall can be used to activate a series of Gehirn- Herz- and muscle cells outside of the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep brain stimulation, a abgibt invasives procedure that electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Thread Würmer does not usually respond to Ultraschall Chalasani, however, noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, increase the ultrasonic waves that penetrate into the Würmer.
The enhanced ultrasonic waves act on structures that are called TRP 4 ion channels and in the Membranen Würmer by some of the cells are found.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that they are zugeordnet, according to a report in Nature Communications.
In order to create Ultraschall controlled Nematoden Chalasani genetisch Würmer modified so that some of its Moto Neuronen TRP 4 ion channels.
If he applies Ultraschall on modified creatures that sound waves are amplified and transmitted through the micro bubbles in the Würmer, where they turn on the amended Moto Neuronen.
The case has some similarities with Opto Genetics, a bahnbrechenden tool allows the scientists Neuronen Impulsen des Lichts auszuschalten.
But sono Genetics Chalasani said, could have a number of advantages to this technique.
In contrast to light that needs to be sent down to an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain tissue of low frequency ultrasound waves can happen without hindrance, and can be sent from the top of the skull in the brain.
"We believe that with Gentherapie and a therapeutischen virus, it is possible to make the zielten human Neuronen temporarily vulnerable for Ultraschall signal in a klinischen setting for certain neuro logical treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin produzierende cells, he added.
