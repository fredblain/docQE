Seehofer: "Borders are not abgeriegelt"
Main man in a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) Josef P端hringer (VP) akkordiert on Monday that further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not abgeriegelt.
The onward journey of refugees in the Bundesrepublik is still possible.
However, it is now just the corresponding Grenzkontrollen.
Special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being, there will be no more.
Those seeking protection were brought, however, with regular trains to Germany.
From the other EU member states called for P端hringer once again increased solidarity on the refugee issue.
That now Austria einf端hrt controls at its borders for P端hringer is "a logical consequence" of the actions of the Germans.
