Time of the decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world watched when the US Federal Reserve in two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, come together in order to make the important decision whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in almost a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half that still thinks last week was of the view that the Fed will do so, now that the Fed is still verharren slightly longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0,25%.
It is a historic event, because it was seven years ago, since the Fed set interest rates to NULL.
"The first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave zero area and starts a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide Leitender employees at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is on a relatively good performance stand, trillions of dollars will be added to the record and generate only a low inflation.
However, the Fed can't ignore the less rosigen views on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust themselves for an increase, but the evidence suggests that the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
