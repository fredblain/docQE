Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Doug estate, told the founder of Magellan Financial Group, with a Geschäftsessen in Melbourne that Metcash will probably disappear within a Jahrzehnts. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to the comments by Mr. Doug estate.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash has included contact with Mr. Doug approved last week.

However, the Großhändler refuses and invested more than $150 million in sales prices anzugleichen hundreds of products each week with Coles and Woolworths, IGA to improve individual traders in the improvement of their stores by faster growing fresh food and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
