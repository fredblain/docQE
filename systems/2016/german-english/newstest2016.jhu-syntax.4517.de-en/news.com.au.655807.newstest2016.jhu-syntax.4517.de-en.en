The woman, when The Bachelor Sam Wood was finally lands to geh√ºllt in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three girls left gebliebenen is certainly not preisgeben, whether it is the one that has received the last rose.
But as we are with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows a day before two of three eincheckten, you may accidentally given a reference to who the victory will be.
Sam Wood maintains his lips until the finale on Thursday versiegelt
All three women have avoided lyrische way about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor, his Partnerin Ehrgeiz, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be.
However, if the question is asked, "If not you, who should receive the final rose?" Could be their answers to Spielverderber Woods, who won the heart of Bachelors.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski called both quickly - except themselves - Mackay as the best Partnerin Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the first day on.
"From the moment when I went into the house and energy (Sarahs) and Sam said, because I felt that they were quite compatible, and I have thought that throughout the course of the show," Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is with both feet on the ground, makes it so much fun to be together with her," added Markoski.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
You feel comfortable and komfortabel.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood as the pair would be well suited.
From their point of view, Mackay said that the house visiting last week made it clear that Wood "the One" could be.
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, it was clear to me that this is not just a game - now I am obviously vorbehaltlos set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if they do not, because it was puzzling.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
