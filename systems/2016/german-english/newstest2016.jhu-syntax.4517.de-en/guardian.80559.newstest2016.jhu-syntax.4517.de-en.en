Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of exclusion from the England team, but it is still hard
Has selected in England's squad for the trip to face Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, is a difficult task, but if one sees is not a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat on my card.
I would not rule out an away victory.
Alastair Cooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good Spin players in the Batting list and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear scars of 2012, only a young and positive attitude.
Moeen Ali as Spin Bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown quantity at Test level, developed with the ball is an option for the attack.

The decision to let Adam Lyth is difficult for me to analyse as his head coach in Yorkshire, of course,.
There were two good attacks in difficult conditions in his seven Tests, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There was no question mark there with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination - and I said this vorhin - players are their own best chooser.
A long time ago, it would have extended the run of Lyth, but he had control of his own destiny.
If he beats out hopefully more runs for Yorkshire, comes another chance.
The England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even if he was not so good services rendered, and it does not surprise me; he is a team man.
The question of how much time a test shot man gets to put his characters is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances, as Sam Robson got in front of him, while Nick Compton nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play Heim- and abroad.
The only accusation you can levy was that England was first used in the Caribbean - Jonathan Trott as Lyth in peak form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he is a hit man I einschätze high.
He is an X factor Cricket players, what we saw in Yorkshire early in this season, when he scored against us at Trent Bridge pitch 236, which made us very.
He must receive at least the same opportunities as those in front of him, but that of course depends on the team to a position in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen beat next to Cook to leave, which would provide an Extra Spin Bowler and received four Quicks, appeared on, and I have nothing against it.
I do not see why can't beat a man there, and this left-handed has already shown that he is a devil guy from Cricket players.
Moeen has perhaps not done its job for Worcester County hire, but he is a number 3 for them, and because there is no big difference.
My former team mate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at first drop, before he appeared in 2001 as Opener.
He has now made three hundred runs and has not looked back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as Back Up Spinner and, in my limited dealings with him, he impressed me as a young man.
People may see his statistics - an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Punt, but there are a large number of Backup Spinnern raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the England team has made a few clever Ergänzungen in the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the game's most nette guys mitbringen a wealth of experience, as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball part of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the Setup.
I always felt that he created for the International Cricket competition is as a player or as a coach and as Mahela has Einsichten, from which we can benefit from it.
Sometimes new voices can bring a breath of fresh air in the cabin Umkleide, even if the messages are consistent with what has previously been said.
Collys team colleague in Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used in the One Dayers Root received a similar break against Australia and, for my part, I have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team on the plate does not determine the timetable.
And you must bear in mind that their jobs depend, as with the players from the results.
Such decisions are not taken with a light heart.
