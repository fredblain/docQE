David Cameron The Lorax certainly knows better?
There is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will be not long before you know it almost auswendig.
Unless you are perhaps David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of childcare systems, the prime minister decided to name his favourite children's book, The Lorax, published in 1971 environmental fable of Dr. Seuss.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron super camps in a message on the company's website, and has continued: "Funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I vorlese like my children, because it always seems a picture or to give a message that we have missed so far."
All well and good, except that the following paragraph in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book instead of a film version of 2012 wiedergibt Inhaltsangabe new characters and details added to expand the relatively short Originaltext.
"In the midst of the city ummauerten Thneed Ville where all of nature is gone, and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, in their desire to see a real tree, fulfilled," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss hostage and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if that were not suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads in part as the summary of the Lorax movie, which will be presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins: "In the city ummauerten Thneed Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
Although he zugibt pragmatischer a father to be here, it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the plot of the book so little. Hears cases of an unnamed boy, such as the local environment by the greed of money and trees, despite the protests of the name Lorax Thneed Strick Once-ler, a Hock end schnurrb√§rtigen beings, "that speaks on behalf of the trees," is devastated.
Most likely was such a relatively low PR task a helper delegiert who has read The Lorax 20 times in a row, not a child.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the text was likely to come by Camerons constituency office.
Super camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Camerons employees, but gave no further unmittelbaren comments.
