Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, believes that military action with German involvement in Syria is a possibility.
"I think the firm thought about military options for action should not take place without Germany," he said.
He threw the European states "kollektives Wegschauen."
Four years ago it was pleased that the Kelch of military involvement went over to Germany.
"Now the conflict is" things before our Haust√ºr, he said in the German country radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase in international aid for the refugees.
