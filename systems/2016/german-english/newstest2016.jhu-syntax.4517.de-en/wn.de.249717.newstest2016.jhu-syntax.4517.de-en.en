The federal cabinet decided on Wednesday Strategiepapier digitaler infrastructure from the house of transport minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes, among other things, investment in the development.
Dobrindt spoke of a "new Mobilitäts era on Wednesday on the sidelines of the IAA auto show in Frankfurt."
The automated and networked driving will increase road safety and make for less congestion, Dobrindt said.
He wants to discuss the issue with his counterparts from the G7 countries, at the Frankfurt Motor Show will also meet with representatives of the industry.
The Ministry of Transport said, among other things, the importance of mobile Breitband Ausbaus and one zügigen Strategiepapier Umstiegs on digital audio radio.
