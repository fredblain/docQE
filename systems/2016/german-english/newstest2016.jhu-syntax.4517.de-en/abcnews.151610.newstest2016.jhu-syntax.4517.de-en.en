UN chief says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban Ki Moon says its response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the conflict lasting almost five years, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief calls on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council again, to unite themselves and integrative negotiations to find a political solution to support.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the edge of the ministerial meeting of the General Assembly later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the Aufspaltungen in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make "unl√∂sbar this situation."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria, they have shown in reaching a nuclear Deals with Iran.
