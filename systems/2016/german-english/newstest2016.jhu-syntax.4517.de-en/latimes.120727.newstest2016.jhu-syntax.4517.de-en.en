Federal Reserve Strategen two days this week to spend their most anticipated meeting in years sitting around a 27 foot Honduras mahogany table, in order to decide whether it is time to raise the federal funds rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Drohend verzierten, two of them at one end of the floor sitting room is a wall painting of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues to put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: Maximierung US employment and keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a shouted unge Benes third mandate: Financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predict them. It is to be announced on Thursday, if the US economy is ready to start, from the unprecedented stimulus in the short term interest rate close to zero since late 2008 entwöhnt.
Although most economic data show that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials anxious to strengthen this volatility by increasing the Zinses for Bunds - and it is also only about a quarter of a percentage point.
"Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important in the first place, what they" see Lindsey M. Piegza, Chefökonomin at the brokerage firm Stifel Nico Laus said & Co.
"But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty is enough justification to continue to wait around the global market," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which unsettled the financial market to itself.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently have predicted a rate increase this week.
Financial markets expect the Fed, with a key indicator, but a Abwarten anzeigt only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market, if the Fed increases the sentence, unless that Strategen abmildern blow by promising that a further increase is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped by 228,89 points, or 1.4% to 16.599,85.
The action has been triggered by expectations that the Fed policy this week's sentence aufrechterhält, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this time, "he said.
If it does, "they would have to go very far in their statement, in order to reassure the financial markets, so that they are not in panic."
Other experts argued that a rate increase would reassure the financial markets, because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
A month ago, the Fed seemed on the way to increase the rate of 0,25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a langsamen tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress this year they would be required to expect a rate increase in spring and early summer.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and in the vicinity of the Levels, the Fed considers Vollbeschäftigung.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly under the year target of 2% of the central bank, said the Fed's representatives that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower Ölpreisen.
"The economy can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macro Economics.
But the financial markets all over the world zuckten together late last month, after China had abgewertet its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by more than 16% below its peak in May, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drosseln global growth.
Something the market has recovered in this month, with the Dow is now up almost 10% below the high of last May.
For the Fed representatives should influence the market turbulence of the complex calculation, when to increase rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks had not occurred, it would attract the reins in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the Federal Reserve.
Now he predicts that they will wait at least a month to get to grips with the impact better.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy, and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China," Oliner said.
None of the Fed's main concerns is the health of the global economy, so they should be involved in their decisions not technically.
But in the end, the Fed's monetary authority in the world.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint of Ben S. Bernanke then leader in 2013 that the Fed could reduce their monetäre expansion "Vere," triggered confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined with each other, that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere, but also with other central banks can be expected from the Fed representatives and experts advise that in order to get a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Kara Bell, head of global strategy for the asset management of the firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., said this month that "the Fed has a history of excessive reactions to market movements, which apparently are not associated with the fundamental economic data."
Lacker, a voting berechtigtes de uses for an interest rate increase, a member of the Federal Open Market Committee cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "despite begrenzter erkennbarer impact on growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, these cuts made the Fed chief.
The Fed should set only during a severe crisis as the market collapse in 2008 in the first place aspects of financial stability, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Committee for the Bank of England to set interest rates.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
"You will certainly not get in the situation in which she has said fear of a rate increase, because the markets" aufregen, poses, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the dual mandate and not mentioned Finanzstabilität, and until that is changed, I do not think they should rush ahead of time.
