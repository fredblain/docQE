Disney plans new "Mary Poppins" -Film
Legends to anr√ºhren yes, but Disney still dares to a new film of his Klassikers "Mary Poppins."
This is according to "Entertainment Weekly" but not with a Neuverfilmung, but with a kind of sequel, which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It is about the Nanny's experience with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews, is still unclear.
But the director is already clear: Rob Marshall, most recently with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
