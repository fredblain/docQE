Jarryd Hayne has had several options in order to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the US - and there were many other teams, the questions sent to his beeindruckenden open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would Hayne banished for the rest of the game on the bench, when he lost a Gerangel so as the Aussie rugby league Konvertit did in his first Punt Return on Tuesday at 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
However, Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity to Punt Return, and also in the running game for a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula Umkleide showed his true colours in the cabin after the game.
Instead of mahlen his Rookies before the rest of the team through the mill, he ermutigte them.
Tomsula st√§rkte Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his verpatzten fishing and to worry about the next game.

It was certainly not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian Gefolgschaft had hoped for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the pitch after the Fumble fluchend and later told the Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"This was a thing that just happens, it cares only about the next game, and that is it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer led with his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass in his own in-field Goal Try for Queensland.
Overall, it was still a great experience for the 27 year olds.
Hayne posierte for a photo with fans and holds an Australian Flagge after the game and it postete on his Instagram.
