Experts criticise Public Health England report on electronic cigarettes
Claims a state funded agency that electronic cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to Tabakindustrie, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), joined by the Lancet to criticise Nachweise used by Public Health England (PHE) in her report on electronic cigarettes.
PHE published the "principle" report last month and describes him as a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have called into question the Belastbarkeit data and pointed to the links between some of the experts and the Tabakindustrie.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "außerordentlich windige basis," reasoned PHE on his most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked whether the allegations "are based on stone or sand."
Martin McKee, Professor of European Öffentlichde Simon Cape well, professor of epidemiology at the University of Liverpool Klinische and health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "A fundamental principle is that policies should be based on the evidence of the effectiveness of public health."
They said that the public expects PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking," based on a detaillierten review of Nachweise and modeling.
Indeed, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a more technical criteria Entscheidungs analysis (Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to lead their opinions about the damage of various nicotine containing products to Synthese; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Cape well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro Swiss Health, whose CEO is previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a Nachhaltigkeit report, they said.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting said to receive funds from an electronic cigarette manufacturers, but not the funding it after reports earlier should have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, she added.
The reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not delivered, but they include several known electronic cigarette champions, some of which also indicate an industry funding in the paper.
Some of the other participants in this meeting are not known for their Know how in tobacco control.
Taking part in the meeting also took the PHE tobacco pipe.
The group's research, "admits bezeichnenderweise," wrote that it is the damage of most products on most of the criteria "for a lack of" hard Beweisen McKee and Cape well.
But none of these connections or restrictions in the PHE report will be discussed.
McKee and Cape well said that serve as a way to smoking for children or Nichtraucher PHE's assertions that "there is no evidence so far that electronic cigarettes were" premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE said that was already previously responded to the allegations by BMJ.
He said: "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second lifelong smoker dies at his Sucht.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are small in comparison to this, but that we have to continue to study the long term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the dangers relativen compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a disease with regard to smoking and smoking costs the national health system £2 billion per year.
Through the clear Vorlegen current Beweisen that electronic cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage that is caused by smoking, we meet our national jurisdiction.
