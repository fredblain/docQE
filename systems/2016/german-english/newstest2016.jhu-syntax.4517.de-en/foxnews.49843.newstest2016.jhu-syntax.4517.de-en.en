Stars who lost their luck Bringer
The actor (left) pictured with his son Redmond (right), had a few busy years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime Partnerin, Farrah Fawcett, due to cancer.
The actor has also reportedly struggling with drugs, and in 2008, he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this is certainly taking its toll.
