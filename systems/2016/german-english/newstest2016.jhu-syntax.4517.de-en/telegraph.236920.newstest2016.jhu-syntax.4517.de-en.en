FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates before the game against Dynamo Zagreb must be behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger stressed to Wilshere, it was not until September and provided his Rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
I am sure this optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will miss at least the next four games for England and, given his history, his participation in next summer's European Championship, is still uncertain.
The great shame in this current problem is that Wilshere had finished last season strongly after a separate Knöchel violation and then again was back to his old swing found during the Vorsaison.
This kind of "at risk of injury, not the career," Wenger said.
It is a bone heilte not good.
This is not a major issue.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his Knöcheln or with the injuries that he had before.
That may be true, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury from a purely medical point of view, whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops a unangenehmes pattern.
The study by Premier injuries Ltd 23 different diseases of Wilshere recorded since his debut six years ago.
League games in the last five games he played in just 65 of Arsenals 157 times.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have suffered the most injury days in six of eight times since 2007 / 08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and combat force," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to overcome that.
I hope his body stabilized durchlaufen, I am confident that he will do it and he is a career of the sort that he deserves.
Arsenal begins its Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday evening before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger is a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and" the players who need it to treat a small Verschnaufpause, Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites in Group F play on the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds in Europe with the biggest effect of intimidation.
Unge beat Dynamo after 41 games, after the "unbesiegbar" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium has been shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening, and 3.2 were measured on the Richter scale.
This year, it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the lesson from the last season with the Champions League defeat against Monaco and is driven by the distant hope with his management to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
In 2006, we were very close to it, but on the other hand, I am in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ehrgeizig, but we are not dreamers.
