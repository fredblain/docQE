BBC should abandon East Enders, former boss of Channel 4 says
The former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said that the BBC should stop to send programs such as East Enders and The Voice. "He said that commercial rivals" would give their right arm for hit shows such as the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs, which are not sent by other UK broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for public legal programs, which is likely to be seen by a smaller audience, to place in controversial Zeitfenster hard against the most popular shows of their rivals and of channels such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director General, Tony Hall, said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, told Johnson that he is six years into his time at Channel 4 have tried without success to get in touch with the BBC.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes commissioned or sends the Lords communications committee as part of its inquiry on the future of the BBC, which would also clearly demonstrated by not subventionierten rivals," Johnson said.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I do not think the medium or long term is a good idea, you should at least give its production to programs that others do not, or commissioned.
You send The Voice in einem erstklassigen Zeitfenster, because they want to reach as broad a support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it is ridiculous, it is, of course, nonsense.
Johnson said: "I do not see why a regressive tax to fund programs that could be funded without Subventionen.
The voice is such a program, East Enders is another zugegebenermaßen both own product ions.
Frankly, other channels would give their right arm for.
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public and legal television.
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, Channel 4 ran from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was to blame for the chase for ratings, "due to the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long term support."
His comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give that back to what Tony Ball, the former head of Sky in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC should sell shows like East Enders.
Johnson said that the programs rather public service "should go to BBC4, where you can pretty much do not measure the audience, but they perform their tasks, and they can argue that if they go to their pseudo saints missions to justify broadcasting fees of £4 billion," Well, of course, we have created all these obscure programs that no one has seen. "
You put them in a Zeitfenster in which no one ever wanted to see them.
For broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more objective recourse system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from this.
Of course, you all think we all think that we are receiving a great value for £150 per year here, but for those who wonder is £150 for a lot of money, whether that is true, because they do not consume much of the BBC.
The former Sky- and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, aussagte also before the committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC should review its Reithian mission to "inform, to form and maintain."
He said that only a little of the BBC production would now officially klassifiziert as education - he said that there were 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on the radio - and they should take an example of public service television in Australia and Canada, this change to "inform, educate and entertain."
On the question of Partnerschaften Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, he said that only a handful of which will be shown on television, and with the commercial broadcasters say alliances to make everything available online.
