Eight golden rules for living in student housing homes
Eleven years ago I moved than even vergessener 19 left Berets and moral Relativismus students in a residential home, still in the faith, but now I remind myself of the strained smile - and many of those who I've geärgert langatmigen complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned, can be destilliert in eight simple rules.
The collection in student housing Heime ranges from slightly nervous aufreibend to absolutely terrifying.
It is tempting to tell schwatzen: People where you come from, if and where you have sabbatical year taken yet because of where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you love Marmite "said neither honestly hate guys in seriousness, it is only an extract Hefe hahaha, I am" in my room.
You breathe through.
And you help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
In contrast to those with whom you are talking about, even if your eyelashes were on fire and that fire had Löscher guides the conversation and helps you find the people who you would like.
Lassen people.
The rooms of people often turn to drink recipe ions, movie night venues and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people put themselves and their underwear right back.
Related to this, you start thinking not of the university with a relationship
Introverted get a rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a Refugium, but many students living Heime form a room to room Bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I love you, and I want our friendship continues, but you have to weggehen so that I get the energy back I verbraucht for interaction with you."
You try to feel when a Kommilitone anzuklopfen Geselligkeit is exhausted - and you will send him a text message.
Speaking of anklopfen: You Tun.
A guy in my student residential homes had the idea that a closed door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Backen close friendship.
As you begin the university at the height of the Back mania is the Klopfen at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of Brownies, less strange than the greeting of the 1950's "Welcome to the neighborhood, so I have baked you something. And now please smile, if I ask you a few personal questions."
Hausgemachte offering treats is a good way to close Freundschaften.
Their Mitbewohner feel obliged to entertain themselves and will associate at the end of your face, perhaps with a delicious surprise.
Of course this depends on whether you are a decent Bäcker.
Bad vermischte Klumpen lead from flour, sugar and fat, people are sleeping, if you anklopfen.
To steal food, is a gängiges crime in student residential homes.
Of course, the claws of Hühnchen is a theft, but it is also take a drop Milchs for your tea?
You check the owner with the milk.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even when they cook inside.
If someone stiehlt your stuff that is annoying, and you have my Mitgefühl - but you try umzugehen ausgewogener Spülmittel to punish thieves as my Mitbewohnerin added to their milk.
She is now in prison.
You should make no noise abhält people from sleep or work.
It is not just about being a decent person, but that they belong in the truest sense of the word say to the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my Flur asked their neighbours to ask whether it makes them a little Drum & Bass something quieter, because it's three o'clock in the morning, and they had a test in the morning.
You responded with yet more loud music.
When they finally at 5 p.m., they left their neighbours freundlicherweise sleep two hours before they had their own music aufhörten plärren abschloss their door and came to the three hour test.
Would it not be romantisch, if your future Ehepartner would randomly move students living in the same home?
It might not be Mitbewohnerin Abgrund deeply embarrassing when you consider your future Ehepartnerin ranmachen to separate them again and they need to see it every day, and perhaps witness as herüber draws all common friends?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot Mitbewohnerin is definitely not your future Ehepartnerin you try, at least einzureden your body under a little bit of common sense.
Leave In aufregenden moment when you realize that someone has his keys in his room, the line between a Ulk and harassment is not verschlossenem feiner than it seems.
A good trick is funny, but it takes only moments before he is for Bumerang.
Erteilen jemandes Verstecken amüsante and a valuable lesson about security - but you never to flood rooms with dental toothpaste and shampoo.
You Verschließen not more than twice their door, and they put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put their possessions in the tackern Gefrierschrank - but you stuck to the ceiling.
