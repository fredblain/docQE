The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general reconstruction of the "New Werft" Linzer industrial line is officially closed.
In four of the six floors of office and production building is the stock exchange listed IT company S & T eingezogen (2700 square meters), the rest is to be rented to young, innovative companies in the technology sector.
"IT are the wise heads in our commodity - and we have to try that they work for us," says S & T chief Hannes Hauser.
He could imagine, and later also to invest in startup companies of the New Werft which akquirieren.
From the beginning, S & T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - what a lot down Hauser promises: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested in the location of S & T, 3.3 million euros from the Tech Center, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, Ober√∂sterreich, the country and the Federal (FFG).
The building is leased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S & T and Tech Center.
30 percent of 2700 square foot rest area in the building are already rented, there are questions for another 40 percent.
