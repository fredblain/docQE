Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of "Kollateralschäden" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and in the opinion of the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis jüngere talentierten duo that is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks," came through the infamous battle of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters ins Rampenlicht.
In a feurigen qualification game in Cincinnati soon after Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice had to be separated by the referee, with Harrison ausrief: "Beat Wawrinka should have Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen, as he was a tennis racquet zerschlug, after a Krampf vereitelte a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis Healy steadfastly defended.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup semifinals against Britain.
"One thing that I was, in my view, is the fact that Thanasi hineingezogen ereifere me quite a bit in the dispute," Healy said.
He has broken a racquet when he lost in the US Open because of a Krampfes, but he is not the first player Thanasi has broken a racquet in frustration with himself, and I know well enough to know that he is not proud of it.
But, really, he has behave extremely well in the US Open, even under the circumstances pretty provokativen with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around themselves, and I believe that he was treated a bit too strict.
He is a very mature 19 years, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in Umkleide areas, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and young guy and I think he deserves to be judged on its own Verdiensten ausgereifter.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios in the important decisions, which begins on Friday, and he describes the joint decision as the right one for everyone, but he is the man from Canberra, as long an integral part to return to the team. "
"First, we hope that the team is fully focused on the competition and not" to all the controversies rundherum [Kyrgios], Healy said.
Schlimme very quickly and I think Nick has managed the rise, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out, he is rising in the eyes of the public, and he has made some mistakes and some time outside the Rampen Lichts deserves all the criticism he gets, but we are trying to support him, we are trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. He can only think about it I think is appropriate, and it is best for the team and it is the best thing for him.
