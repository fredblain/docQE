The boss of JD Sports says that higher wages could jeopardize the expansion.
The CEO of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher wage for UK workers "could mean" more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit the expansion plans of JD Sports, he added, and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs.
