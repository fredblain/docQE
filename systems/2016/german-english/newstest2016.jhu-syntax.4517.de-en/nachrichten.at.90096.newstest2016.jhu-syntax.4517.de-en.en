That Viktor Orbán sends another Zigtausende to us now is a logical outcome of a sham saints policy:
Instead of helping in Röszke camp immediately with the construction of structures that ensure Humanität, our Bundeskanzler has high officially and publicly put the attitude of the Hungarian government in the haze of circle Nationalsozialismus.
Sorry end of this policy are not just the Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The Geflüchteten also will have to say that the "promised land" they invited and welcomed welcome is nothing but another Flüchtlingslager.
There will be a major challenge, given the ongoing Flüchtlingsströme and the approaching Winters, producing menschenwürdige conditions for protection search at our end.
And it will be even greater - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
