Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back against rivals for claims to ring fight
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticism of the tack Ling described his players as "Agenda Setting" of two Premier League favourites in the NRL.
Sydney ROOSTERS coach Trent Robinson said that the referees have allowed the Storm players "ring" struggles with his team during the high Storm's victory in the Qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a little verhüllte note the Storm team, after his team had reached the Final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "Musterbeispiel from Queensland Rugby League" and said that the two were not "too good" in the Ringen.
Bellamy defended his team's Tacklimg and said that they were concentrated at the tack Ling only on their "contact."
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches his team confident stimme him because it meant that they were worried to be beaten by the Storm team.
"That emerges again and again - I have not heard that Trent Robinson spoke about fighting ring, as they have beaten us 24: 2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that, throughout the year, we have changed nothing in our defensiven Trendwende system or techniques. But in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that has provided for us.
Trent is obviously a great team to train there for three years now, and he has to lose, and he is therefore probably not accustomed to, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is funny how that appears again and again in this season.
Bellamy Bennetts idea was attacked as a "football from" exciting football "and his mentor reminded that Bennetts St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with" long.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He has compared his game on Saturday evening with our game on Friday night, and how exciting it was, "said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized in 2010 as a long because team, and Wayne said that he will attend a Scheiß dirt.
But now he has a team that can play and that we regard as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game that you want to play when you have these kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play the kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so that they can play like this.
I baue stronger confidence, because they say these things because they are a bit concerned, having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably have not thought of us when it came to the big games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against ROOSTERS achieved a better result than the Broncos game against the Cowboys.
The Broncos' game was a good game, I have not yet seen it, but what was the result? 16: 12?
Our game was 20: 18, there were two more attempts in our game, but it is an exciting game?
Make or break and Spannendes no points?
For me, it is the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet in a stage still on it.
The Storm team has released this weekend, as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cowboys or the cron Ulla Vorfinale Sharks next Saturday night at AAMI Park. The ticket sale will start from next Tuesday morning.
