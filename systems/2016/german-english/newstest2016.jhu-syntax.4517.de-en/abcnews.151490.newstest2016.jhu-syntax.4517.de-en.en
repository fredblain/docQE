Weihnachtszeit Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers
The Spielzeug- and baby products retailer Toys R Us says it will not stop so many Christmas season staff as last year, but says that he will give the current employees working with him and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. In Weihnachtszeit 45.000 workers were discontinued in 2014.
Most of the jobs will be part time jobs.
The company said that it will begin this month to resume talks and a rise in the number of staff from October to December.
While the holidays are even closer to the Christmas business is still months away, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers, provide stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
