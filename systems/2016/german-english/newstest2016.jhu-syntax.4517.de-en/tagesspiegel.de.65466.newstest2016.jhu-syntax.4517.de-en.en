Angela Merkel and the Flüchtlingspolitik: "We create the"
The influx of refugees is a huge challenge - the Bundeskanzlerin is determined to adopt them.
What comes to Germany?
Around 800 000 Asylbewerber Germany is even capable of absorbing a million refugees will come to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Interior this year, according to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD).
Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can create that, given the unusual challenge and we create it."
What zukommt on Germany, gives the following overview.
Used to be different forecasts between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of Pestel Institut) homes a year - and for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as 250000 homes will be built (so far).
Dramatically, the lack of Wohnraum is, however, especially with bezahlbaren rental properties: A year fall out 60000 to 80000 social housing refugees from the rental price fixing, and this particularly affordable housing will also apply.
Federal Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) will therefore double the promotion of currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Far too little is that from the point of view of Pestel Institut: Social housing 80 000 a year would have to occur and that would have the federal government invest a promotion to the tune of 6.4 billion per year.
Are scientists and federal construction minister agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing.
According to estimates from the Institute for work Markt- and professional research is expected that 55 percent of Geflüchteten can eventually be acquisition work in Germany.
Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education, however, were not systematically asked for their qualifications, in order to help them at the start, criticised the refugees in Germany in Bertel Mann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees is crucial, however, is whether they can find work in Germany.
Work is the key to social contacts for the appreciation in the host society, but also for the self esteem of immigrants, migration for Douglas Dietrich Thränhardt says.
There has been a political turning point: The ban on work for refugees in recognition of work according to Thränhardt in Germany.
Whereas before there was a ban on work for Asylbewerber by up to five years, this has been reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the duty of residence, limited Asylbewerber at a residence.
In the view of society - also because of a lack of skilled workers - the majority has asserted that refugees should be allowed faster access to employment.
A major hurdle for access to the labour market are a lack of knowledge of English.
So far there are no ausreichendes offer language courses related to education and work.
Studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore Thränhardt view of the royal road to integration work.
The Berlin school administration found that few geflüchtete parents give their children in Kitas, there are an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the entwurzelten zuhalten parents is very important, the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
In order to convince the family still hand slip from the benefits of Kita, the administration distributed in different languages.
The need for female educators should rise sharply by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for example, by allowing more schools.
Students in the countries without knowledge of German welcome classes are prepared for the classroom.
You are fully trained but not always informed Lehrerinnen and teachers, but also, as in Berlin, of teaching staff who have a qualification in English as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of Berlin school administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no state Asylbewerbern or patience, but prohibits the study - the only exception was so far Berlin, inside Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his attitude.
Studierwilligen refugees could be made easier access to university.
For refugees with a stay Gestattung Asylbewerber performance or Duldung receive no benefits under the law, if they start a study.
The latter have basically no Bafög, because they are not covered by the circle of people entitled to BAföG.
Geduldete refugees have so far had to have lived in Germany for four years, in order to be Bafög right from 1 January 2016 to cut the margin to 15 months.
This funding gap needs to be closed, Steffen Krach Berlins undersecretary for science, and the German student demand.
Students should immediately get Bafög.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many of the refugees are Muslims, and for many, the religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should give Islam gradually the same rights as they have the churches, and the existing state churches right weiterentwickeln Religionen ratio to a new state.
Also important would be the establishment of an Islamic charity drive professional association that cares for the newcomers.
Belong to the rights and obligations.
As the representatives of Islam must agree on clear Ansprechpartner and be willing to cooperate with the government in many areas and give him some Kontrollmöglichkeiten.
This also includes the willingness to act against religious Fundamentalismus beherzt.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts will be taken to Germany on Thursday.
Those who have wanted to remove such conflicts in Germany, "to immediately have their right, the Bayrischen Rundfunk verwirkt here, in Germany," he said.
He proposed to translate the Grundgesetz to Arabic.
Integration will be a theme of the whole society, much longer than today.
So that the majority of society will have to change, the elimination of discrimination and racism is pushing.
Germany has a point against discrimination and Allgemeines equal opportunities law - as a result of European decisions - for less than a decade.
But it is very slow, as the NSU murder series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What not white German immigrant organizations and interest groups are calling for a long time and what international agreements require Germany, such as the Anti Racism Convention, must be a reality in the next few years, if the country remain peaceful and his new Bürgerinnen citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to feed the refugees expected to date medical doctors President Frank Ulrich Montgomery says.
"In terms of man- power and capacity we create that," he told the Daily Mirror.
But for that extra money has to flow into the system.
In order to avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery calls for health cards to hand all the same Ankömmlingen during registration.
Services provided could be abgerechnet later with the states.
And in the long run, it is highly fragwürdig abzuspeisen vorsehe so many people with limited performance catalogue, the Asylbewerber performance law.
Otherwise, the doctors are, above all, to create the language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has proven, migrants will be aufgeklärt about their illness worse than other patients.
Praxen Dolmetscher costs would be taken not only in clinics, also a doctor, she urges.
Helped would be many refugees but also with more general medical Ambulanzen starting points in the event of an emergency.
And with another diagnostischen look.
Under refugee children, for example, give it far more unbehandelte disabilities and HIV awareness among young people go there.
German doctors would come in terms of their education but clear, with the images of some other disease, Montgomery says.
"Para Siten Befall or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And regarding the lack of doctors, even relief in sight is perhaps by the refugees.
The Syrians have a high entwickeltes education, many refugees are even doctors.
To practice, they would have to prove their skills, however, might take exams again.
At least half of the refugees in Germany ankommenden is mentally ill, according to estimates by the Federal Chamber of psychological therapists (BPtK): Most suffer from post traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly verletzlich explains BPtK Dietrich Munz, President.
A recently published study of the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatisiert.
Anyone who is suffering from a post traumatic stress disorder, suffers from others in so called flash backs with Atemnot, dizziness, heart lawn and Todesängsten.
Other symptoms Schlaf- and concentration problems, firm strong shock and emotional taub are.
In order to prevent that the symptoms would be chronically, an early treatment needed, Munz said.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive a psychotherapy.
Mentally ill Asylsuchende in Sozialämtern can make a request for psychotherapy, but the treatment usually takes several months.
Subject officials or doctors were not trained for mental illness in the Sozialämtern also tend to decide whether or not a therapy is necessary.
This often leads to false assessments, Munz says.
