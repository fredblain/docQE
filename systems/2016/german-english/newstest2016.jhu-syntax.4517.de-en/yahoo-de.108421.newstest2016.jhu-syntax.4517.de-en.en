EU wants to double mercury limit in prey fish
The European Commission wants to double the Grenzwerte for mercury in large predatory fish and the Verbrauchern zumuten a much higher dose of the nerve's gifts.
The consumer organisation Food Watch before a working paper of the EU, sharply criticized the plans: "The risks and side effects verfehlter industrial and food Watch Umweltpolitik passed with full force to pregnant women and young children," said Matthias Wolf Schmidt.
According to Wolf Schmidt Grenzwerte nervous Giftes should be increased for big fish at the end of the Nahrungskette such as Hai- or sword fish from "wirtschaftspolitischen reasons" from one to two milli grams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
Large predatory fish are tainted with mercury but already so strong that about 50 percent of the Fänge must not be sold on the basis of the current Grenzwerte.
After doubling the Grenzwerte then just 14.5 percent would not käuflich.
The EU in return for the easing will exacerbate Grenzwerte according to watch the food at other grams of fish from the current 0.5 milliseconds to 0.1 millimeter of mercury per kilogram.
Food Watch described this as a "trick" because small peaceful fish such as carp are most impacted so low that they comply with the planned Höchstwerte today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfides diversion, which helps the economy alone," said Wolf Schmidt.
A high for people giftiges heavy metal mercury anreichert Nahrungskette is particularly strong in predatory fish.
The federal government warns so that "even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system especially in Ungeborenen."
The Federal Ministry for world explains on its website regarding the current Höchstwerte but that was "not to expect a" health risks to the general population.
Mercury come mainly through coal Verbrennung in the environment.
The German coal plants run according to a written information of the Federal Ministry for world to the Greens federal MP Anna Lena Baer emittierten Bock in Germany more than six tons of mercury a year, two thirds of the total amount.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe, Rhine and Donau was "permanent and nationwide exceeded the" mirror "in March from the paper," had quoted.
