Why I will be able to witness a Exekution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch how a man is put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it does not happen, I will sit in a public gallery in the death chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation has been on his best friend, and although I was shocked I agree, for the first time in January.
As the day got closer, I began to fear me.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists must see Hinrichtungen makabere lottery in the United States, and often there are more applications than places available, will take place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will watch it without emotion.
I can't.
I will sit alongside Richard Glos IPS engstem friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with Telefonaten and a visit to two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot if we are talking about.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so it will be allows me a notebook and a pen mitzunehmen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remind me of all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter, give up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
You tell the story of the prisoner, as he wants it, and you get access.
I values me with her.
You admitted that "it could be better," but she still thinks that it is wrong, what I do.
Richard Glossip has had a problem with some of the things I have said and written.
He tells me not to say what I have to write, and I would not do it, even if he would do it.
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter is present, in order to write there.
If he dies, he thinks that the publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bell Ware, a report in the Huffington Post, is sitting next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the Podcasts series, which I have done.
I will not go back on all the details.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a Beg√ºnstigter fact.
But I believe that there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of murder.
I certainly believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe that his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective, I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be truly objective.
There will be other reporters to whom you can turn for that.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a needless death.
