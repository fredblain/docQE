He weinte.
I am not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he will not play in the group stage.
I hope that he can play again this season.

If a player leaves the room with this type of injury, are all very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.

It was possible for me not to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was on the road in a different direction, so that it looked as if he had [Moreno] touched him, but I could not see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6 Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad. We're so sorry to me.
