Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds in Eckental means fränkischen terraced houses for people who do not have much money.
So for instance for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need Wohnhraum, but as the single mother and low earners."
"I show how you can build cheap and good even today," says the 44 years old in the interview
Thousands of refugees are pushed in the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheaper Wohnraum can be created: It builds in a project of terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will push for the housing market.
What solution you offer?
Markus Gildner: The mass accommodation in Containern or gym halls has no Nachhaltigkeit.
Because people stay here to a large extent.
In light of the refugee Stroms Wohnraum we need enough in the next few decades.
A very banales three geschossiges Reihenhaus is the solution.
Gildner: A Reihenhaus needs less space.
It facilitates the integration.
This is different, if it brings people into residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are being built in the pilot project consists of three units for four Asylbewerber.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living Aufenthaltsraum.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace, I go back again.
Then the houses can easily be adapted to the respective needs.
What are the costs?
Gildner: The price of 160 square metres of living space per house amounts to EUR 184 000, without plot.
This is überschaubar.
Has taken six months of construction.
This is appropriate.
Have the paramotor verkompliziert their plans?
Gildner, Baur Real, I have learned through my project correctly.
Particularly complicated there is always the threat of Damokles sword Sonderbau and the regulation of parking space.
Creepy.
It is still needs at least three who creates three apartments in a Reihenhaus Stellplätze.
Only in the cities is a lack of space for it.
And refugees and Asylbewerber have no cars.
As residents have responded to their Reihenhaus project?
Gildner Asylbewerber: There have been those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings.
What is definitely not.
But do not exacerbate the competition by bezahlbare housing?
Gildner: Bauboom in Germany is true: We have had in the last five years, but were built luxury flats that no one can afford more.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need Wohnraum.
Not only refugees, but as the single mother or the low earners.
I show how you can still build cheap and good.
So it goes.
Markus Gildner (44) studied micro system technology in Regensburg and employed first with environmental analysis.
