"American Ninja Warrior" kr√∂nt first champion
Professional sports Kletterer and became the first athlete who won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took home the grand prize of $1 million with operating aid Isaac Caldiero.
The competition show that just their seventh season abschloss had never seen a contest participants of all levels could complete his obstacle Parcours.
During the season final managed two men, Caldiero and camera man Geoff Britten, through to the finals.
The last task that belonged to a 75 foot long Kletter climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the job within the time by which he was the first athlete, but the arduous phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. Vollendete Caldiero ended this challenge a full three seconds faster, which made him the winner.
Caldiero $spoke with E! News after the hard won victory, still under the shock of the profits of the big prize of 1 million.
"I think it is amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000, or" had to life, Isaac told E! About his pile of money.
So all of a sudden.. I can not even imagine how it is... the future is unknown.
The executive producer Kent Weed, sat with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and gets why Britten, although he ended the first Preisgeld Parcours, not any at all.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalists, it is" the one with the fastest time, Weed said.
How much money is a wunderbarer price and changed the lives he receives the great Gratifikation.
I do not think he harbors any resentment about it.
He is so happy to have just done what he has done.
Mass of awards he received from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff Isaac said to me: "If I was to be beaten by someone, I am glad that it is."
And I think that Isaac would have felt as if they had swapped roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for a Achte season that filming will begin in the spring of 2016.
