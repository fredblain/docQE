Exceptions for the new Bern Rieder Sporthalle
The council of Bern Ried approved Bauantrag Sporthalle expensive for the 2.3 million euros.

So should be built a saddle roof with a First and roofs over state "not Mitt.
Planning background is the intended use of the roof space for solar installations: "So we get a wonderfully big southern roof together," Mayor Joseph Steigenberger said in the meeting.
In "liberation" was in turn around the roof inclination to lie for energetic reasons - other than prescribed in the development plan - below 10 degrees.
The volume of the hall is being significantly reduced.
A "liberation" was needed because the development plan allows no exceptions "on the roof inclination - with the Bern Rieder council usually more restriktiv verf√§hrt exemption applications.
