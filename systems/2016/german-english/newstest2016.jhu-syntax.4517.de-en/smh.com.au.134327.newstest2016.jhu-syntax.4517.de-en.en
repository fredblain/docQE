Peter Moody says that stewards tried to spy him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moody claimed that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a Spion in his stables in the past year and threatened to end the race.
He zielte by Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the Late Lady Tatai Scratching Halm on Wednesday due to a race day treatment, the last straw, to the stewards and the Integrit채ts department.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he did when it came to the positive cobalt Tupfer test at Lidaris vorgefunden themselves under difficult conditions which he cannot explain.
He had 18 months because of espionage charges that it withheld and did not "look like at high hanging grapes."
"I had to say anything about it, and I have spent a long time out, but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know that it went further.
Sometimes you responded, and we must live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I would like to collected head to go around, and I would like to think that my owner that I try my best for them.
If they start to think, I do not do this, then I should no longer be coach.
I must then consider what I do with my license.
Previously had the bomb in an interview with Moody Racing .com can go high that Integrit채ts department had tried to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll call when I am asked what I do - and offered him a job in my stables, in order to provide information on Racing within my St채lle," Moody said.
You seem to believe that I am a fraudster.
If that is the case, it should certainly be on their noses, because they have failed in an attempt to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL were aware of this at the time and there are still today.
Would like to bring this to the view that it is personally?
The RVL has behaved cowardly and makes perhaps people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Perhaps the people out there think that I am there.
Maybe they need to let me take my license and offend me, and I have no doubt that what I say, they think about it now.
But I have now reached the point where it is no matter to me, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put the pressure on them and push them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The frustrations levels of Trainers have with the long ongoing cobalt investigation in Lidari built, and the Late Scratching meant that he said that he "could throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known through his preparation of Black Caviar ungeschlagenen master, called the race day Behandlungs rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the legs of horses, which was against the rules.
"It is against the rules of racing sport.
I must take full responsibility for that, "he said.
"One of my employees has applied irrt체mlicher mud on the leg.
It was last night as can be.
May be so it had throughout the day yesterday, which was also the case.
It was also so Renntag.
Moody could be faced with a three month Disqualifikation for the treatment with the pack on Renntag. Opened an investigation into this matter.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules do not know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but it has gone too far," Moody said.
