That will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
A rate increase is coming, and the Hausse will get upset that bond yields will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know how long that takes and how long it will last.
In particular, the story offers little guidance to the end for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months.
The Aggressivität the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, but not always, a factor in how the economy and financial systems respond.
Therefore, representatives of the US Central Bank have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates, but rather on the period that is required for the normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, market participants might say, however, that all the excitement was probably exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The Fed's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of" cheap money "," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the allmähliche US interest rates return to normal levels, but still too low level for Seis mix shock many seem to fear to lead.
This does not, however, mean that there will be no impact.
Here is a look basierender on historical trends, as some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen in the last month, the advance payment can make things of interest rate increases volatil for a while.
As soon as the increase eintrifft, the impact is not so dramatic.
"Apparently, there is a tendency that asset returns are abgewürgt 12 to 24 months after the first hike, which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens to interest rate increases by the Fed.
More specifically, the market is usually in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to raising interest rates, relatively flat in the 250 days after that (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal condition after 500 days, with a durchschnittlichen returns in the past six past Zyklen 14,4 percent according to a recent analysis, Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tend to occur later in the cycle of increase and the yield that begins to reduce.
Rezessionen are a fact of business life, but they often promote interest rate increases.
In the current case, the Fed is faced with a number of conditions that did not exist before and which could hasten a recession.
Most remarkable is that gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank nominale GDP was at 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice under 4.5 percent.
Although the second was 3.6 percent of 2015, few expect that this will continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate increases in such a fragilen economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it is different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants throughout the year to a rate increase by the Fed have been taken, and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many Strategen and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trading is only a 25 percent chance.
"In our study have all increased Zyklen from 1950 to today put in place and pre-recession GDP levels very quickly after the start of the recovery in the shade in a super cycle with increasing momentum," says the report.
In contrast, this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest, the Fed has maintained since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and these are so far 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, because the market is anticipating a rate increase, and quite similar to the pattern as on the capital market.
The main difference is that the impact on bonds is faster than in equities, if the change their strategic course.
With bond yields seem to change direction, once the first increase / decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the cycle of increasing the bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Strategen by Charles Schwab believes that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds back closer together and lead to Abflachung curve.
High verzinsliche bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although "we are still cautious, higher yields to be expected," said Kathy Jones, Fixed Income Analystin at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interesting, Jones says, is that the markets have already adjusted to Fed policy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of Inflationserwartungen there are few signs that the market to the prospect of tighter monetary policy has been adjusted," they wrote.
Short term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flacher credit spannen have extended their strategy and the volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market, when the Fed tightened.
By and large companies that the greater part of their Geschäftstätigkeit abwickeln in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products more attractive.
Multinationale companies with high debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, and also the financing of its debt.
"History shows that" Qualitäts- "shares tend to respond very positively," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report three months after an initial rate increase for customers.
Companies with strong balance übertroffen companies with weak balance after each of interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, on average, by 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares exceeded their counterparts with lower quality by an average of 4 percentage points (percentage points) and 3 (each).
Debt is a major problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure stock games will benefit consumers by the rising dollar also.
Savers could see profits through higher yields, even though experts have different views of how quickly that will take place.
