<seg id="1">Professional sportsmen to say a Stylist - also a good psychologist</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Had gemeckert about, how Stylisten will be able, in introductory article, I have a bit that this was a bit to every substance for the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">When I guessed in any way which still is</seg>
<seg id="4">To hear of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how this is the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It get, even worse:</seg>
<seg id="6">Ever closer places of the examination, we are ahead so more of information and practical tasks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But also when the way forward is taking on Saturdays, and on each, he nevertheless is documented fully. it privileges</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we discussed with Director Alena, how a madam attracts the not perfect proportionierte figure;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And these are still the majority of us.</seg>
<seg id="10"> There are those who have a neck on short, who else are a jungenhafte figure without other proper turns and once again mollig:</seg>
<seg id="11"> There is cause of Stylisten, at concealing look broad shoulders, numbers have been thrown about in an almost casual fashion and conjuring to extend the neck or the necessary trends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got too, which gave multiple advice, how it attracts a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez, it was pretty, and figurbetont, without it works too provocatively, so great Busen, hip and narrow Taille</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">For example, the difference between Taille and hips will give out, it is so great, that of no suit coat, or the pair of trousers really, if itself schneidern to let it at least a piece for degree..</seg>
<seg id="14">It will not regret we undoubtedly, because well values to wear, is simply priceless.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made coat is committed it namely much better, than a of the piles, the tolerance extremely and verrutscht in the Taille absteht, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Jungenhafte characters to allow in turn, to bear clothes with Falten, Bauschen, applications, or Raffung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In this lot am the information and Figurtypen, I welcome that I have a whole week time, as to let me all thoroughly by the head..</seg>
<seg id="18">And yet I have been afraid that there can not create almost, in the entrusted encouraging handovers is out -</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each Kursteilnehmerinnen was namely a Promi, for they devise appropriate Outfits. Tagesbekleidung and Abendrobe;</seg>
<seg id="20">We are in the current appearance, the Modestil of the relevant stars and its Figurtyp to take into account.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> I attract, Mr Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the campaign at the Victoria 's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Within I juble because this accounts for me to attract myself much better, as on such Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased I think in the last time in the 100 kilos, or even the young Selena Gomez..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes should ausschneiden to look we from magazines or Internet, ausdrucken working, and then grafisch.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Moodboard, the entire result called is intended to come then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design expressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is very important to reflect also on the graphic side of Stylings.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist namely prefers to the role models not just purely physically, but also more of the so-called Produktseite in the journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">From us tells of the Stylist and designers, Mr Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In other words, a Stylist did a good overall picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Of Samstagsvortrag angefüllte, with information on Figurentypen has tinged right from three visitors from the industry:</seg>
<seg id="31">By Stylisten to Jan Pokorný, the fashion designers Jakub Polanka, and by Modefotograf Ben Renc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> Jakub in Cairo reminded us to the fact that fashion illusion is and this is a Stylist to be able if, to exploit it as:</seg>
<seg id="33">And eingeschickter Stylist can achieve to work with a single Bekleidungsstück on the whole in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word means of variability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So we should bear the example, a Trenchcoat, as usual, on the jeans, so as a T-shirt or veil, we carry it also on the bare body, Absatzschuhe to do and contribute than clothing it.</seg>
<seg id="36">It goes, to the sleeves or to the affect down and equally of the entire look suits very provides different.</seg>
<seg id="37"> Play that, emphasised it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">At most I was the next council: first to her to know perfect to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="39">Only you violate it, said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally I will be clearly, why we have all these theories we must pauken, what we can combine with what, and why, even if we must be seen often in Modejournalen quite else;</seg>
<seg id="41">To mention the whole of Modeschauen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Thanks to the photographers, Ben, and I know that a Stylist is much to prepare more Bekleidungsvarianten as it, ultimately photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">So it is preparing for a Fashion story with ten sides to the point, at least fifteen to stylen:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And it is also that the clothing on the photograph in combination looks with other accessories, sometimes very differently, than reality</seg>
<seg id="45">With everything, must expect we therefore in the management of Outfits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that images and Styl sometimes account the half of success, which we confirmed also, Mr Jan Pokorný;</seg>
<seg id="47">As it needs only just look at Madonna, not have just brilliant singer, from the image and marketing of a world star with respect, have made.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In Tschechien and is one of the services of a Stylisten to be rather striving.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also know people often think it for wasted funds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And when already is obtained from us are stylen it we should expect that then it imposes us with a large likelihood, a different size, when he then takes in actual fact..</seg>
<seg id="51">Then you need to googlen then only, in order to establish, with safety, that the tabloid press writes that the appropriate Promi again fallen or etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> Jan and Mario showed us on Sunday to draw, to believe that a Stylist itself must zusammenzubauen will focus on the fashion and just that outfit. there you are</seg>
<seg id="53">In its work communication, he has much more to do with the people, which it stylt and it must be a gewiefter psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">The people einschätzen, without itself anzubiedern and his views.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">If we to make any businesswoman also takes on management tasks, so to sift through their Kleiderschrank and to supplement about nice pieces, the situation will, we resolve the whole storage cupboard and hemp to my goodness, that is so terrible.</seg>
<seg id="56">We at least must find a few worthy things, on which we should as be possible to bear to do, said Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was also very specific, which so will contain a so-called Platztasche.</seg>
<seg id="58">So as a pocket, who we zuknöpft on the Taille and in the people to all necessary Proprietäten in itself, which is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Apart from this clear terms, how the gap between Abroller on Haareentfernen or Sicherheitsnadeln, which does not contain it also such Utensilien as a Nylonfaden, of specific Clips, with which the cart before the clothing will be gerafft, if it is too great and obviously Nähzeug.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> Please understand that we not must listen however only, but also somewhat in practice can try, have learned as one, taking off your shoes properly unterklebt.</seg>
<seg id="61">In taking photographs, on Atelier, can damage the floor just is, where we have the Schuhsohle, out the much less.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Us oC klebten, and we klebten</seg>
<seg id="63">With the one touch, the shoes not even so that we, they are not damaged.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore we do really skilfully.</seg>
<seg id="65"> Mario, was very pleased by praising my creation without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="66">The earlier great skill, namely not it is my great strength</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67"> All this, it was just the fraction of what we got on to hear in the case on second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is one that is becoming I now clearly - is too to pay the Styling to professional level, is not easy.</seg>

<seg id="17">We offer no moment to give the impression that game would always again be same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are all to see even very nicely, even though the technical level of the graphic display is not more on the former parts of the series that on.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore not, the lay-out;</seg>
<seg id="20">But the driving by means of the desert, by herbstliche landscape or highly high by profound verschneite landscape we visually very like:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is sometimes again atypical elements that bring a little change in the individual race..</seg>
<seg id="22">The desert for example surprised of a Wüstensturm, the idea very restricts the point of view.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains, in turn to ensure it extremely carefully that we not will be verschüttet of an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Incidentally be incorporated into very good to cut the individual race..</seg>
<seg id="25">Only a few, but they are adequate.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a while, they are trying so to overtake the compulsory number of opponents, then has time of making up time, then a One personal international expecting with a single sides.</seg>
<seg id="27">And he is intervening also still in the police, the one will vermasseln the whole thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">An innovation of voters, they are of the passages, in which Jack is leaving the car..</seg>
<seg id="29">Here it is more certain of interactive Animationen, should flee in those Jack before any someone and where the players are helping, when is it that the right button in right moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">So not delude ourselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It surprises, however, that it is much less such of the passages in game, when would be entitled to expect it.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ultimately it is the matter more for the benefit, because this element has a least do not stand a chance of boring to werden - it belongs which have been said in context for high on the elements, who to diversify to make the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">To the Fahrmodell and lack in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">It means, by finally centre, although no trees, and on the other hand we say, it would be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">If realistic simulations is seeking, itself are forced in other places.</seg>
<seg id="36">However a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren, also the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well fair, although one better in the competition to find.</seg>
<seg id="37">Meanwhile, it is as far as everything in the best order;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems, have disappeared only after certain time. this</seg>
<seg id="39">In contrast to the Fahrmodell, is the Kollisionsmodell not very essential K.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of one game this type, calculated not to expect that it complicated Deformationen and collisions, but when it is practically before any impact on any one object idea, how the car is then obviously not all in order</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typical example throw light upon the close that did or Vorbeifahren on oncoming cars on some posts of the other car, only easily, in others, almost identical situation is however into arrows and centres headlong performance..</seg>
<seg id="42">Or goes the Karre at scrap metal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thank the Restart-Systems which makes out although not further, from annoying, it is finally for it.</seg>
<seg id="44">Is the Restarts to resolve so: if we did write-off or far be absent of the line ends up, then the first, raises the game to the last point of reference of the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">Just in each race was only of five Restarts.</seg>
<seg id="46">If we, it has been exhausted, is going all the right direction..</seg>
<seg id="47">The Restarts therefore rather is such a thing as a tool for the case that it does not succeed, but about should leave itself not and we would rather.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes helping not just of Restart, because helping not different, as to learn the critical section from their heads.</seg>
<seg id="49">Very unpleasant, that the same things are often the same posts going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some trends that pass through it for example to the whole of specific kind and way, otherwise it fits simply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere we will be further damaged in the relevant point of civil cars are always regardless in the same configuration, whether it comes as first or fifth or five seconds sooner or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">Which is particularly annoying in situations when we can see that the comes round opponent as far as we are concerned before a cars who is happily on two oncoming, however important, even there by it and slow down the cars already in such a position that they steered or need, I</seg>
<seg id="53">And it is not when important people they and it is all designed the fact, for it is always close to this situation before your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The sides are still further advantages</seg>
<seg id="55">In the whole game, there are a few posts, where we are always out of date to the same point by same opponents and also here again without consideration on the time:</seg>
<seg id="56">To happen on Verrücktesten, for conclusion of the game on the long bridge, which we are counter.</seg>
<seg id="57">The opponent as far as we are concerned must be disturbing, overtaking a here seem to the devil to escape.</seg>
<seg id="58">And it is then already sometimes before a, then he is a naturally adopted to the view, sodass it there are initially the own cars to travel a few time in Klump.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Be clear - we will make the game simply more exciting and aufregender, but this intention is vermiest so clearly, that they quickly have the pleasure on game..</seg>
<seg id="60">And that it is a pity, because despite einfacherem Fahrmodell, the game is also so aktionsgeladen as a whole is very entertaining and There has been a certain amount, for aware, almost we not more; which is the head, one;</seg>
<seg id="61">And in principle is no matter, which is the blame to point - the concept with the 50 unique routes, the orders of the race on a way for that can raise no boredom, or rather quite different</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the Wagenwechsel in the course of the race;</seg>
<seg id="63">We must not overlook it the petrol stations to the route, because just here there can change the car, although the most cases, the car is sufficient, which we has just.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The car divides in three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The prams are well appropriate, for the urban areas, the strong American brand for the draft of motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentinen in mountain regions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand and the way of the Spielgeschichte is also the Aufgaben-Modus - so, at the end of the day to the in the various hiring out, which it knows from the history.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here, it is not just some medals, but also Erfahrungspunkte winning for the own profile, which work together for the tasks and the history is</seg>
<seg id="68">In order to reach the higher Fahrerniveau, have caught up various objects: starting by cars, including to the Backgrounds for the profile, and so it is</seg>
<seg id="69">That it is linked in parallel with the Online-Funktion Autolog, which provides its own achieved results are compared with those other players and also for further collective functions under other things.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> One further incomprehensible Schnitzern has a situation in last race of the story</seg>
<seg id="71">Here it is: the car in an underground rail tunnels, where rast as shadows on the railways that we have been.</seg>
<seg id="72">On Tacho paragraphs looking between 150 b 200 kilometres per hour, but is suddenly of the cart before a metro and drive a uncompromising to scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">In our text, we may still argue for long time about the fact that this was a blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether we think the authors for stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is no Überwältigendes but the visual overall picture is very attractive in most cases and here there even brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="75">Is all the more galling is that some exciting moments are of becoming the Bildwiederholfrequenz more slowly and it is sometimes quite tragic</seg>
<seg id="76">This subject however, notably of the accidents with major number of parties concerned, in which a continuous FPS in any case nothing benefit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The Tonwiedergabe is as far as O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache..</seg>
<seg id="78">In its endeavour, to raise a broad, as only possible scale, rather young audience, of a Soundtrack arose a lá of each something - but who buys such a game already because the music?!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of Need for Speed: the run for energy, ' the feelings are rather also true.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game, the aforementioned total unnecessary mistake, not diminished, we would be able to compete with the held conviction, for the run for energy is the best piece of NFS in the recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But so the game in some way does immature;</seg>
<seg id="82">In itself, should be prepared for a one pleasure but we support to say that one such mistake with the Power sting of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes, and it</seg>

<seg id="3">The Treaty of Lisbon means that one made the balance under the individual institutions from the track.</seg>
<seg id="4"> I would not expect that such a hard war is becoming..</seg>
<seg id="5">It will discuss five, six years are continuing to be until settling the dust and all in their new role itself have used, began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, very strongly to their presentation to the legal faculty..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How is the motto seriously on Europe is understandable and open, they have demonstrated to be able we, on the first part of their speech, in which it managed it; the individual institutions describe of the EU, and their mutual relations on such a limited amounts and understandable way, the fact that it is so some Lektor of the legal faculty of the Karlsuniversität would therefore, and it</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Madam Vicenová here praising also of the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Initial criticism, was loud, he was too quietly - a grey official, the equal of such a role, but I have to say, it has up short all the efforts, as well it, for the matter itself was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="9">He is human who it brings to deal, listening 27 Member States can wait idea, how to communicate with them, and the clear first everything from which has, as it should continue with the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new position of high representative for stated Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then as a response on the issue: who is in fact - for the European Union I ring What the number? ', so as an important step towards agreement and better readability of the EU 's policy towards States, as, for example of China or India;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">That anyone we ban our Ölmützer Quargel</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Madam Vicenová devoted also of the agenda, under the subject of the European union was removed, living in the near future action to live.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech presidency before two years described as success</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs had organised the financial crisis and the gas crisis to be successfully handled and also the summit for Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">It referred in the event of the government during the presidency as great Negativum, which the image, the Czech Republic was harmed much. am a bit worried that this may be meant to be 'procurement'</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the European Union has now fully to do to all hands:</seg>
<seg id="17">With the words, the ambassador of the situation, which it said not only in the chair, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not overcome to date still, rather in a state of panic;</seg>
<seg id="18">And when adopted even the Sieben-Jahres-Budget to the EU, the matter because the today 's economic situation is much more complicated, but they</seg>
<seg id="19">That it will be a slim and rigour budget, the economic sectors received over the countries and what less to promote states - all this is now to the agenda</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador reminds also to their own slogan, with which they came after Brussels: to understand about Europe;</seg>
<seg id="21">If I do not, we are gräuliche sWIFTs to contend, are not in their vocabulary and academic jargon has started, the nobody is quite clear.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="25">Following opinion of the EU-Botschafterin are the Czechs in reputation Eurosceptics to sein more of the negative, as positive sides perceive the matter.</seg>
<seg id="26">All the more galling is that the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">That many factors are responsible under other things, also the restraint of our candidate, whose inability to support is not especially to write Motivierungsbriefe and weak to the Czech side:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the successful Czech presidencies, they emphasised the force and cooperation of the Visegrad-Gruppe, the so-called V4..</seg>
<seg id="29">Imagine me, when a Polish or Hungarian on me is, and a Slovaks in the close, then about together, the Frenchman in addition: he what it is when the heads, that is already back your V4 - and it is a rather cause acid face;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Madam Vicenové, according the EU expect in the future before all hard rules for the Budget-Politik of Member States.</seg>
<seg id="31">And much reeller, which was when a European Federation does it on the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds..</seg>
</p>

<seg id="2">The Innovator IBM enters its existence into second century</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Look after a suitable word that the strategy of IBM described on genauesten then, that the word 'long life cycles.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the broad public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it knows, although a modern companies, it has been his creation already a century is passed.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis that long life cycles already presented its first leader, the visionary, Thomas J. Watson sen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already represented the slogan, with countless global problems would resolve easily, if people would be prepared, a little consideration in that respect:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan, Think, was for trademark, about which the life of the future giants is if being struck.</seg>
<seg id="8">It was also that the basis of the business culture, thoroughly prepared of Watsen.</seg>
<seg id="9">For us does from IBM of this long-term thinking, a kontinuelle movement in direction future;</seg>
<seg id="10"> IBM survived the earlier, and I was another reason why a whole century is successful, because it has remained its principles to be true and not zurückschreckte, to change all others among its neighbours;</seg>
<seg id="11">It allowed to us, in the course of our first century, transforming the technologies, the business and also the society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope we are creating in the next one hundred years more, said Bishop Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from reason of the anniversary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thought-out system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The Watson carried social care of its workers in the 30 years - on the same way, how the entrepreneur Bata in the Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute were as one of the first American workers paid on holiday, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and have a thought-out Entlohnungssystem for better innovators and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">As we are more sophisticated, the long-term relations of IBM and its customers</seg>

<seg id="16">That companies choose of beginning to great in the Talentförderung and was accordingly to make. as first first companies, the world lifted to IBM of any discrimination</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie, it is also the current plan, the Palmisan to the head of IBM in next year of a woman is abgewechselt of Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Which is already for thirty years in IBM, so far, they adopted a position of Vetriebs-, marketing, and Strategiechefin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> IBM will make in the recent years 'Online-Brainstormings, that will accrue from those many future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">No miracle gives of ideas - it enough be at company, even working almost a half a million people.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="22">Your firm 's position on business guarantees to the company, a strong image and this following home, and after foreign.</seg>
<seg id="23">Right from the start was IBM, rather the concept of an institution, and a mere Technologie-Unternehmens, on says Economist, the teacher of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24"> IBM does not technological companies will locate, but rather a company, the Geschäftsprobleme to resolve by means of technologies, has always fallen to add that George Colony, created by Consulting-Firma Forrester Congressional Research.</seg>

<seg id="32">Not to all products and innovations which met the taste of the customers of today - unfortunate for example of the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online-Service were Prodigy or the computers, IBM is bound to continue using PCs jr.</seg>
<seg id="33"> Business is on the moving forward, therefore we tie emotionell to the past, believes this Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why IBM has no problem, can be constructed of his ground on various platforms - and if they work, to leave it again.</seg>

<seg id="48">The IBM behalf took it until 1924 - originally it was a mark for an establishment in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The cornerstone for future society, IBM has presented the merger of four companies, whose history to the 80er years, the nineteenth century goes;</seg>
<seg id="50">You have had technologies as the example, the famous Stechkartenuhren on registration of the work begins, and endes.</seg>

<seg id="52">And it has Flint of the leader of the Konkurrenzfirma, Thomas J. Watson took to ensure that it helped in the leadership of the company of this way.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Leader then even made the founders of IBM in the shadows at Watson 's ideas founded to date the unbesiegbare culture and identity of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54"> Watson, who chaired the company by 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55"> IBM, began as the name does with the production and the distribution of all possible machinery for the trade of Wurst-und Käseschneidern, including to individual funds.</seg>
<seg id="56">The first four decades, where Watson, the company launched, he already granted their turnover on nine millions of dollars, and the companies expandierte gradually to all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57"> Watson was so essential for the company that he sat whole forty years in Chefsessel, only then it was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.</seg>

<seg id="60">In IBM were developed in years was established in 1964, the first Rechnerfamilie with the same Rechnerarchitektur - the number, IBM, the system by 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">An example of PC, the idea came to a number of the Computer-Standard at that time in years in 1981 under the behalf, IBM 5150 on the markets.</seg>
<seg id="62"> 20 years later, IBM veräußerte its Rechnerproduktion to the Chinese society Lenovo, furthermore, however, they bought, one with the Konsultantenteil of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and increased this full whole in the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">Our strategy, the IBM who is paid in the last three years is the concept Smarter planet..</seg>

<seg id="1">To develop since the 1989 Reisepreise</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Up until 1989, there were only five previous state travel agencies in the CSSR. Cedok, that CKM Rekrea, and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel sold at that time, especially just travelling in the socialist countries, in the west were then just of 'chosen' ones. the</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And so went the Czech tourists to the Baltic Sea, in the Soviet Union, after Bulgaria and Romania came the Black Sea and Hungary on the Balaton.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, as a result was allowed to travel one after Yugoslavia, then of Yugoslavia suggested a one of pro-western course, and so the travel for Yugoslavia is limited much.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialist time was travelling there, that it is not even allowed to citizens of eastern bloc freely in the framework of the Socialist country.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizens of the CSSR, for example to travel on an individual basis, after the Soviet Union Poland or even, then he needed to do a so-called Einladungsbrief, apart from that Individualreisen were not possible</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then the travel and offered to travel in the West, then we had Red Cross has said that it is providing 7,000 tents and however very large queues in purchase to take or also in hot-water bottle from the travel, or have very good friends in travel at least.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also as the matter or was not went long.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called Devisenzusage has given just politically reliable people - the others had not to travel even, with the condition for when the west</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czech currency was no free umtauschbare currency, without Devisenzusage there so would be impossible, to find the necessary funding for a journey in the West..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The weither most Czechs therefore spent their holidays in domestic, not surprising, that the Czechs on many Wochenendhäuser and Datschen who were buying a habit which now continues until there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The samtenen revolution of 1989 was followed by a Reiserevolution of Czechs on the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">And up the 1989 have a holiday of the degree of all things in the GDR or Bulgaria, the Czechs in last year spent by 4.5 million of their Auslandsferien in countries throughout World.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">An enormous paradox which is aware, we are now even not more in itself, it is the fact that we could not travel in the current popular country that attracts tourists of the Czech Croatia by 1989 - absolutely, because it was the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Equally been lifted, the start of the 90er years of the last century on the Devisenpflicht in neighbouring Western European countries, which is a huge wave of Kurzbesuchen; especially after Vienna, Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken were not received for a long time of their travel in the West easy sufficient, everyone, at least wanted have been a few days since it;</seg>
<seg id="18">So the Czech tourist where travelling after Paris in Zelt in Park, who then would have to find the money for a shelter in hotel or a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature in foreign travel of Czechs was one with in preserves should be that the beer and dried sausage and vollgepackter boot, of</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was introducing the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - well, following decades of our tourist were able to shop the Western currency at last free and</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our level and it are also of the Durchschnittsgehälter for commitment, which einmündete in another important moment in 1997;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thank the greater questions after visits after the 1997 travel agents began regularly prepare travel by charters, the air travel, thanks of the possibility of negotiating that, in comparison verbilligten incredibly to the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">End to the 90er years, the Czechs with the USA exception, already devisenlosen payments with all this advanced country in the world, what made the trips still simple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Came to a more interesting moment in the history of the post-samtenen travel in 2000, when the high demand of the first direct charter flight in an exotic country has been been treated so frostily - after Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since then to fly every direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers in long distant sunny countries; in this year but we are directly from Tschechien 12 with exotic destinations;</seg>
<seg id="26">At the 100 Tsd, Czechs travel annual in exotic countries, it</seg>

<seg id="27">Another important moment in era, which marked our postrevolutionäre development, was 2008. in the year</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The general meeting aims to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months for the Czech football is no chairman and this risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek on the tip of the Czech Football Association, not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk, will be known.</seg>
<seg id="3"> To this day: there still is no agreement on elected after any electoral rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">And this is not to the vote on the three potential successor is possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">The three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Trat June Hasek of returning its role, calling his colleague in like to do and has had to find a strong personality to agree itself and that the guided football in the future to the..</seg>
<seg id="7">Only in the era that Hasek broke the old squabbles between the two Verbandskammern are once again the agreement on a common candidates.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That proved klipp and clear on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the general meetings came quite for nothing into Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov, the negotiation that led to no result and this was not only about the election itself</seg>
<seg id="10">It namely could sometimes about agree who is actually entitled to in the Vollsammlung - civil servants, only the statutory representatives or the budget with a power also;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this one point, reached it at least partially to agree, and to soften the recommendation of institute for state and justice, also, whose opinion was not permissible for a representation on Vollmachtbasis, the case.</seg>
<seg id="12">The disputes at the electoral rules take however to continue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The executive committee expressed not more clarity in the matter, in its meetings in principle, it is more the agenda at nothing else; no matter whether proper or extraordinary</seg>
<seg id="14">Also if the views in terms that the election is reorganizing a few time - the key point was the same;</seg>
<seg id="15">The question reads: How to proceed in the third round, to so avoid a stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The bone of contention concerns the question, whether we should proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model to be found, was to note Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, represents in the management to the Profi-Fußball.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The satzungsmäßigem model takes a candidate in the third round anyone candidate, the greater prozentuelle support is given in the chamber, for he.</seg>
<seg id="18"> Moravia is supposedly prepared to respond on the compromise that the person who takes a candidate, the higher number of votes is given from two chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side in turn insists on the condition, the fact that the winner in this prozentuellen count at least receives a two-thirds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Then to the two Vorrunden, have any point more, this modus would put the whole Zweikammerkonzept in question, understands not to angle events in Svoboda 's objections of the Moravian side, which it would find best of the electoral rules, but too choose under valid statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Surprisingly the is voting on forward, even Tomás Paclík, even though emerging, for the with the nature of statutory electoral law of all candidates most think Pelta is</seg>
<seg id="22">My wish is that it will be as far as possible, elected to do so under the statutes it:</seg>
<seg id="23">Themselves abgrenzte that not absurd Ersatzvarianten will come out of his head is standing, as with the last general meeting, the owner said Victoria Plzen, the idea for the first time in his opinions before all Pelta and is taking towards it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Pelta remains however optimistic;</seg>
<seg id="25">Its opinion that the new chairman is aware in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates are going to cooperate in the future also constructively.</seg>
<seg id="26">The possible qualification of national team for the Euro today day would contribute sure to the minds..</seg>
<seg id="27">If the football, only on the euphoric wave ride them will also have the willingness on cooperation, which is greater, believes the official from Jablonec, the playing of the main experience of all three Adepten and this not only on professional, and regional level</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Rajchl is there of moderate.</seg>
<seg id="29"> I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately hypocritical.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is not on the matter between the people from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia, but There are certain efforts, baseline figures, the rules on own purposes.</seg>
<seg id="31">Is therefore not excluded to a fresh deadlock in the general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, that ultimately win the healthy sense, I hope, who said Rajchl, and</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">But remains a lot of time for agreement of all sides - not more.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should become the horror supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether the, will be absolutely complete, for Fußballgeneralität to Qualifikationsspiel, and for</seg>
<seg id="35">To the Charterflugzeug, flying with the other Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, after Podgorice should have been in the morning in Prague for a technical disruption at all in order to launch, and so wanted it urgently after a Ersatzvariante, how bringing it is a part of the Executive Committee after the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Ultimately then after I think, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, which it should come supposedly on Wednesday, and it</seg>
<seg id="37">Have been, the ministers for schools, youth and body as Dobes, the double parties within the greatest Sportverbands of the country like an agreement is moving.</seg>
<seg id="38">Indeed it is a lot on the game. state benefits, of the Vertrauungswürdigkeit 'meeting of the Czech football and that the forthcoming is also the CSTV, which in the Czech sport is forward after the financial problems of Sazka to the new direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> Paclík is in the fight to position of the chairman, because it had not appropriate candidates of the matter is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">When Tomás Paclík, the leader of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting to a strong candidate would be able, which represent, it meets all its ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic of the way, would have been not entered into it is absolutely on the fight about these leaders.</seg>
<seg id="41">If there were a good candidates, then, I would fight to abandon for it and to vote. this</seg>
<seg id="42">But in the current situation has managed it not, to find such a Adepten, said Paclík CTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Is the main reason for Paclík, going to set international with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, is to reach it is therefore to prevent that the alleged favourites of election, Pelta on the tip of the FACR..</seg>
<seg id="44"> Paclík is also emphasised that it will exercise the role of the chairman is only a year in the case of his victory does, by 2013, to the date of the proper general meetings.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position by the Chairman, he should like been to have seen a never get to know Top-Manager, of not too much, is else in the Fußballgeschehen, and</seg>
<seg id="46">With some people coming in question, I was spoken personally;</seg>
<seg id="47">Little to believe, that I have some said, wanted itself does not identify it currently with the Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="48"> Such views to change like the time, led you want to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">On most of all Paclík, allegedly disrupting the link Pelta 's with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands, Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, is short of the scenes than powerful lobbyist, with the ability, to have an impact Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta, the position of chairman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">In his victory, the current situation would forward einkonserviert in Czech football, first of all were:</seg>
<seg id="52">The support by Berbr, would get a reply, a cleverem Businessman of the football is doubly badly, emphasised Paclík..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Plays it also in this important, that Pelta 's name before some time in connection with Telefonabhörungen was identifying in a Korruptionsaffaire, emerged however unpunished from the Pelta..</seg>
<seg id="54"> I do not know which prestige a victory out by Pelta where football to table.</seg>
<seg id="55">And what would we stand was said selling the observations of UEFA and FIFA in the view, rekl Paclík, whom shall its previous words, it the Pilsner Fußballklub, when Pelta chairman will however have been somewhat calmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Prevail Paclík in the Donnerstagwahl and could themselves present it however to a future cooperation with Pelta is entirely.</seg>
<seg id="57">Also think including another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the general meeting in October supports, which was a fiasco..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">He is first to whom I would go.</seg>
<seg id="59">That he has made a great skills..</seg>
<seg id="60"> I imagine me his good example as leader of national team.</seg>
<seg id="61">But I do not believe that it is able to lead the association as managers.</seg>
<seg id="62"> I is not to my nose, but in matters, of which I not understand, said Paclík, and the was made in September, for all it believe that he was behind the Abberufung of Schiedsrichterkommission with Ludek Macela on the top, the Dagmar Damková, it replaces.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Paclík claims even that he is the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden.</seg>
<seg id="64">And here on his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, remarking it is also to head of Pilsen, which was the first triumph with its support in May in League.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> I have to contribute to change the power, somewhat in Fußballmilieu and too a certain cultivation of this..</seg>
<seg id="66">To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which have a tendency to influence disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen which entails bis in front situations, led in Paclík, of no secret from its antipathy towards the example towards the Sparta-Chef, Daniel Kretínský makes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">And one of its priorities, it would address the consolidation of relations between the FACR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee, with its aid in the political leaders for that it would lobbyieren, that more money from the Lotteriesteuer in the sport goes.</seg>
<seg id="68">This is one of the crucial things which is, it should pay, the new chairman..</seg>
<seg id="69">When it comes to taxation Glückspielen, how the political parties declare that, then can understand I to their arguments, then, but it must tell also klipp, and clearly where the money are concerned, said he will be provided;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Its link to the Pilsner is not given to a club in the Paclík, also as a handicap, even though it even stresses the chairman of the FACR must, though, and</seg>
<seg id="71"> Pelta turn is linked with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.</seg>
<seg id="72">It is not just the ideal:</seg>
<seg id="73">It is not in my opinion but also much sense, my shares in Pilsner, transferring a club is hypocritical on a Drittperson in order to return again after 18 months, asked Paclík clear</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> Pelta promised new statute of the FACR, the future ausschlössen a stalemate;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days ago, the general meeting of Football Association promised one of the candidate for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely, Miroslav Pelta, he will make much in the case on his election for I greatly enjoyed drawing up this report; that the FACR of new Statute gets the involve sanctions to generate disagreement on the electoral law of the outset in the future..</seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec is confident before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk and believes the election campaign will defuse sure in a possible success of the Czech choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> Pelta was promised even before the actual election in September, he wanted to focus in the case of his choice on the national team and the collection of financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="78">First on the very last moment, is to participate in the election before the last general meetings and so it was perhaps to help the two-month break, presenting to defend its thinking on the leadership of the football and a broader context. this meat is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">People to all levels are devoting the football, they are impatiently, and expect therefore that the chairman is known on tomorrow.</seg>
<seg id="80">It feels that high time, and that the association of someone is led, about the man who is especially with the Jablonecer club, but was also many when Sparta and executive committee years.</seg>
<seg id="81">Also why it believes that he have sufficient experience do make to be leading the Czech football, and</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is certain that it is the euphoria responsibility for the current problems with the election, which was a time of Ivan Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="83">Unfortunately adopted in the general meetings in June 'statutes, which were not as completely, as it were all to be accepted -</seg>
<seg id="84">If it does not allow different interpretations, we would have this September have a chairman, felt Pelta;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The revision of main document, the Bürgervereinigung used it as bait for the delegate.</seg>
<seg id="86">That I should be the chairman, then I take me to this personal and prepared to bear personal responsibility, if it do not work.</seg>
<seg id="87">This is a fundamental matter, without which it will be, says Pelta for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In finally trying it, is to delimit towards its sides.</seg>
<seg id="89">Previously announced it, he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognises because its legal education and it well know that its Gegenkandidat would be his first deputy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Also Tomás Paclík intervened to it for a long time, not more, the case in turn was no dry to have picked up where it left off on Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">In football, it moves already on a year and can already be some success, and that is</seg>
<seg id="92">Its attacks were shocking but herabsetzend and that a lot of people were of its campaign.</seg>
<seg id="93">And therefore to doubt now many to his real nature, addressed Pelta on his opponent, the well remain to be true to its Proklamierungen, which he already have expressed in September..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">He thinks that its strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, and even to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="95">And should the advertisement of the Czech football -</seg>
<seg id="96"> I would like to make also therefore, to stop everyone Affairen - of the Causa Bohemians, and on the Nachhallen of the Korruptionsskandals by last year.</seg>
<seg id="97">Equally after I would, I would bring to negotiate with the private companies and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football, said to the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK before two months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">Then also; he promised that his introduction in the tip of the Czech football means no human cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="99"> I should make only once to familiarise with the Arbeitsinhalt of all employees, he said to Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness, because the long anarchy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, the forthcoming general meetings of vote, it believes that the delegates on Thursday are not for nothing, after Nymburk will go, and we</seg>
<seg id="101">When really should the only controversial point as we will choose in the third round, then we come the fact across it.</seg>
<seg id="102">The football needs back of credibility and which it is becoming the only way, if it has finally to come up with a new Leader, remains Pelta that there are two days before the, possibly crucial day of its Funktionärskarriere to be optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103"> Rajchl promises that the FACR under beginning is to work his firm</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">That when the previous deputy chairman Jindrich Rajchl on the general meeting on Thursday on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic, should be elected, it would vermiesen this alleged many people in association of the whim, it is</seg>
<seg id="105"> Rajchl is promised, the fact that we work hard in the case of his choice will start.</seg>
<seg id="106">It will make system changes to introduce the members of the executive boards for individual Fußballbereiche responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="107">Also, he promised to resolve the case Bohemians, improving the relationship to the UEFA and FIFA, continuing to bring more money in the football and otherwise the work, the previous chair Ivan Hasek has started.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">As the Chairman, I will devote the football as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="109">Starting by the international contact to the UEFA and FIFA, about the Nationalauswahl to the professional football, including on Leistungsfußball for the young people.</seg>
<seg id="110"> I will not say that, for its purpose alone, I everything; he said Rajchl in talks for CTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111"> I am distributing a Teamspieler and would therefore like the powers in executive committee as the fact that each member is devoting a certain area.</seg>
<seg id="112">And distribute hard tasks, so that the football in every segment with Meilenschritten progress</seg>
<seg id="113">We were many not just delighted, because they, should start, and not only to criticise the work of others, even to work really hard now, when he added to add it..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Given the critical atmosphere in Fußballbewegung to be drawn in recital, at no longer to stand;</seg>
<seg id="115"> I is aware that I am working 20 hours on day.</seg>
<seg id="116">But I must be aware, that there is the point and that people behind me, which I pose not, muzzling a stick between the ground and any step, I make to stand to provide in question, he said, as a statement, why he was hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">Many people have said I, that I should not give up, because it would be done also otherwise to others.</seg>
<seg id="118">This is confidence that we must not forfeit, he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">Claim also motivate, dürfen the work to continue, which it has begun under Hasek.</seg>
<seg id="120"> There are two years, we have to tackle a major piece of work and this will not throw away, I now is -</seg>
<seg id="121">Have been launched to see stop processes, which may come only in a few years and I apply to be very reluctant, that they people, thought it, and bring now its concerns on an expression that the case for that would be elected - Miroslav Pelta of the other candidate, the situation in the times before Hasek is returning.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122"> I believe that in systematic approach and it is a little, which Mirek Pelta not brings.</seg>
<seg id="123">Behind him, there are above all people, which would make football, as the fact that he is only more for a chosen here.</seg>
<seg id="124"> I accuse it some, but that I would be biased.</seg>
<seg id="125"> I try me, objectively to sein;</seg>
<seg id="126">Let me in football for all, because it goes all it well and is not only the select, said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It contradicts also of the assertion, he is just a chairman of the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="128">Also if say some people to the opposite, I have to propose to do really to the best possible result for Moravia, and has, in some countries, even been reduced;</seg>
<seg id="129">For example, it is the time to consider whether we should separate the League not in a Czech and a Moravian part, the winner then respectively in the first League aufstiegen. their</seg>
<seg id="130">It could not happen it, that this three think Moravian clubs in the League play, which particularly is for the young players in Moravia, a problem, about Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because now also, the head of Pilsner club Tomás Paclík, the fight about the role of the chairman is supported, do the authorities hesitate itself not Rajchl, assess its opportunities, and that he is elected.</seg>
<seg id="132"> I feel, a strong support in the Czech chamber, which is elected on her deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes behind my, has led Rajchl, also considers the saving of many tens of million crowns for unfortunate treaties, Fernsehverträgen and negotiations To the Lotteriegesetz as its success to the agreement of it.</seg>
<seg id="133">Furthermore, it gives itself on part of the fault for the association on a single line, which has not one:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While it of Pelta states, he is disqualified from a priori, is to help the Czech football to new confidence, does it to the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate, the idea was offering the football really somewhat, of</seg>
<seg id="135">Nobody to ask questions, the fact that it has done in Pilsen of the outstanding only one year work.</seg>
<seg id="136">It should elect, then, it may continue the things, the Ivan Hasek has taken as well, would not change to the human occupation in the commissions that he obviously fundamentally;</seg>
<seg id="137">He altered just the situation certainly not on his favour, expresses the Rajchl on its rivals.</seg>

<seg id="4">Now it should be a German to address.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">As this thought Axel Weber, no doubt, and</seg>
<seg id="6">Again after his spectacular departure, who was caught by the top of the Bundesbank in July, the fact that he would take to a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: Verwaltungsratspräsident to the Swiss Großbank of UBS - a unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Axel Weber was in public, praising Switzerland whether a matter covered their beauty and the of UBS, whether their new lessons in expenditure while guaranteeing sound and allowed kind remarks about the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">Who of UBS managed the Turnaround;</seg>
<seg id="9"> I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger, and Oswald Grübel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But already in September was clear that would come very different everything, including</seg>
<seg id="11">One the of UBS traders, in London had been gambling found themselves all security system of the bank evasion and around the euro 1.7 billion;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> UBS-Vorstandschef Oswald Grübel; a banker gerühmter do not only in the Switzerland, go.</seg>
<seg id="13">Of the Verwaltungsratspräsident, the of UBS since then, is also a poor shape - and all ' when to play at Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Already been aware that Weber are discussing the bank of February 2012 in that.</seg>
<seg id="15">It already takes not, and the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz in May - only in 2013, how the bank told on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Union for Axel Weber will be severely one;</seg>
<seg id="17">It is not in other, but Ökonomieprofessor and Notenbanker, and would have to have had a Einarbeitungszeit of course need.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a blow, it takes the responsibility for the strategy to a Bank, which has just once again demonstrated that they long deserves the title 's largest Skandalbank of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the of UBS schlittert one hand references are enormous and other for years of a scandal in the next, and recently it has the biggest asset managers of the world</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing seems, is spared of the once such pride of Swiss Bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It began in the crisis..</seg>
<seg id="22">And 2007 which of UBS was an excellent reputation. this</seg>
<seg id="23">The image was combined to express the suppressed and solid, but also ausgebufften of the Swiss Vermögensverwalters with ambitious objectives: you wanted in Investmentbanking to a huge number.</seg>
<seg id="24">So the of UBS 2007, managed one hand with $1.6 billion to put more money vermögender customers than any other bank of world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And also they all huddle together as a Investmentbank in the league of the greatest banks of world..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Which made it seems.</seg>
<seg id="27">Of the former bankers and subsequent long-standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans following to tell us: my students, along the of UBS at that time more as models of a good Bank.</seg>
<seg id="28">From today view, asking itself am irren it, how could I just such that?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He wrongly are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 was first obviously, for something should be bringing substantial schieflief in the of UBS..</seg>
<seg id="31">The middle of year was surprisingly done, Peter Wuffli, the idea in the meantime than hochintellektueller and equally genialer bankers applied.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some months we guessed, why he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Investmentsparte of bank had been gambling found themselves with Subprime-Papieren and might as well forget about billion;</seg>
<seg id="34">Saddled the of UBS, it has announced to a capital increase am saying in level of and schreibe to 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">For they found investors, but what, on which some gerümpft, until briefly before of the nose even: one intransparenten Asian funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, the way was concealed that told you to his behalf not again, a concept</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But this was only of the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008 and it was worse;</seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank had known a new deplored, Verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel Ospel, management board nor the 2006 paid on zweitbesten Switzerland, was back</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 that was followed by the disaster: now embark on the of UBS was saved with their investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had the authorities..</seg>
<seg id="40">The Central Bank bought as from the of UBS for many tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe, on which they will Miteigentümerin of the bank was</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole Switzerland was shocked too, because they said, how dramatically it is for a small country, if it so accommodates great banks. the</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally the balance of of UBS 2007 was more than five times so great, such as the Swiss economic performance.</seg>
<seg id="43">Again, we will save the of UBS, said Bankenforscher following:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster closed itself to the second, and we</seg>
<seg id="45">Already only a matter of months away to kapitulierte the of UBS, the main item on tax dispute with America and said that they are ready, adopting the data vermögender customer, which perhaps is evaded to the tune with aid of the bank tax were</seg>
<seg id="46">Also it was a payment of dollars more than 780 millions - and the reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Thus the of UBS was acknowledged longer or less openly, to help in the tax evasion. -</seg>
<seg id="48">While they lost something, which has been always been since their capital in competition about rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy;</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was not more the same.</seg>
<seg id="50"> There was the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident..</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of Kundengeldern;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">As the Bank in the space of a few months lost its credibility in both key portfolios: in Investmentbanking, the Fehlspekulationen in the asset management by the aid on tax evasion, which is</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And it as was again somewhat calmer, just as it was under the impression, now the of UBS intend to establish it once again, since item is this unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual of traders verzockt euro 1.7 billion, before the bank can see that rather going wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it will obviously: using the risk management in Investmentbanking, it does obviously always still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">With the Adoboli, did to see it that the risk control is changed too little, says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also of the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is certain: the problem of UBS is that they not has the risk control in control.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">In it, but precisely which has been the idea to the caution, with the Swiss bankers before long time set out, werden the guardian of the great assets of the world: no excessive risk was perhaps to collapse for security for money, in other words: also beyond the Alpenrepublik in the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">To the Tresore of the Swiss banks were the emblem for unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli is particularly noble of chocolate, and</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The centre of of UBS in Zurich does still on the classic dichotomy of excellent Swiss, one, it is rather just a greater</seg>
<seg id="60">Already, the situation is classic, I believe</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters in the Zurich Bahnhofstraße, who directly made by Hauptbahnhof from the Zürichsee leads, the aims to the schneebedeckten summits, the Swiss mountains, in order</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are here prunkvoll, the Ladenmieten are the highest in Europe;</seg>
<seg id="63">Jewellers, as Tiffany 's, it does here between Swiss Traditionsgeschäften like the Confiserie Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">Since centuries stay here to follow the example of the Swiss banks: elite of the Central Bank on the palace to the Credit Suisse and to private banks, such as Julius Pooh.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The Empfangssaal, the of UBS govern it by a serious Drehtür..</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside of the walls are marmorverkleidet, before there are thick Ledersessel alongside the Bank-Logo, a major by placing a sign in their regarding safe. There are calculations to</seg>
<seg id="67">The of UBS am aware, what is the customer to look here: security</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank beef both Swiss banks, of UBS and the Credit Suisse, but at some point - or as well as betraying how taken of the leader of a small Swiss, one.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name to read it rather in the newspaper, he makes finally, as all Swiss financier, also with the two big banks to do business..</seg>
<seg id="70">To the of UBS if much too great, it will - especially in Investmentbanking, where is a sigh of the Anglo-Saxons also;</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss people would have to say there no more.</seg>
<seg id="72">And when surely they are adapted long of the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Actually it was the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking, that of UBS changed it only high profits, and then now fear, the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in Subprime-Dschungel, like the Swiss Großbank..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008, the disaster was apparent</seg>
<seg id="75">On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation, writes the author Lukas hässig in his book of UBS-Crash.</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or around 45 billion agreed the politician, not to save about which before the failed under Großbank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> How possible is coming it To this end;</seg>
<seg id="78">We talk, with Swiss bankers, they see the problem before all the size of the of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 two, the three of Switzerland banks closed itself cooperating on a huge group..</seg>
<seg id="80">It arose of a bank, which was great already in the merger to the small Switzerland - and further increased.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped, that supplemented the two different Vorläufer-Banken of UBS: internationalisierte to have a rich but verschlafene bank with the emphasis of asset management in Zurich, and a poorer, but already more.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the internationalised Investmentbanker came good to a lot money, with which they could revolve a huge wheels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names have linked with this promotion of UBS: Peter Wuffli from 2001 to 2007, company himself of of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, who was then the chairman of the Administrative Board.</seg>
<seg id="84"> I was thinking always, Wuffli and Ospel were a Traumteam, says Bankenforscher Hans following.</seg>
<seg id="85"> Hochintellektuelle to the Wuffli and Bescheidene, and the deal of models and statistics is clear, and Ospel, the Bauchmensch, comes the top heraufgearbeitet of the Banklehre by one.</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel have left to the conclusion on Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli have made the end, probably a decisive mistake: he was thinking, his models are the reality, says following.</seg>
<seg id="88">This is a tragic case</seg>
</p>

<seg id="6">That he is intended in addition of the new permanent secretary of Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for the literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">That he has written an unusual book, which it describes not incorrect as a work of Anti-Geschichte.</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains, but a few great names, important treaties or famous battles. it hardly have his ambassadors, reckless reporters, or discussions on tactics and equipment..</seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, declared he rather more of a book about how it was it is about feelings, impressions, experience and sentiments.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Beauty and observe almost the Kriegserfahrungen of 20 and more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war, of Schulmädchen and Botanikern and on mountaineers, doctors, Krankenwagenfahrer, and Büroangestellten.</seg>

<seg id="12">Some people will become prisoners of verlieren Gliedmaße, will die mad or reviewed '.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each life of hope for the future has come as the Votivkerzen in a church, some coming while the other hand would lapse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Englunds, it is a different book of the usual history.</seg>
<seg id="15">It amends, furthermore, the idea that the first World War, only whether the devastating Stellungskrieg on the Westfront..</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories will act of honour and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognises its own drive for ferocity and says on the war: it feels that this is despite this everything, which was more planned for men to sit than Lehnstuhl, to do in the hands, and so with the Abendblatt or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whisky, as meant this facade if civilisation and there is no barbarity behind the own strengthened and beschlagenen Hemdbrust.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">The other way round recognises a British soldier that he will look to take to die rather from nobody note or are therefore probably -</seg>
<seg id="36">If we, the idea to sacrifice itself takes far, and think we that this is happening before a public, writes it..</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is so terrible as a convicted man, have been hanged in secret.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations to act of the Old Europe, which apart is covered on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">The conflict was increasing to a economic competition, schreibt Englund, a war between the factories.</seg>

<seg id="14">However in a way it is a striking distortion of those who remain who their Online-Aktivismus combine with a Offline-Aktivismus appears wiser, more democratic and less violent than those which sit behind their Computerbildschirmen.</seg>

<seg id="15"> DEMOs work is a example as Facebook to be a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16"> Ideenfabriken, and medical researcher and political analysts are using the side, in order to study everything of health issues and even on Gesellschaftstrends, as in Likes, text and Statusaktualisierungen.</seg>
<seg id="17">Working with more than 800 million users, who add the content on average of three per day, Datensupernova of a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side increase in the title in the last five years to almost 800% of Facebooks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">To achieve some researchers for the good thing of Facebook to the fact that we are studying people by this side, which we normally with his Clipboard on the road..</seg>
<seg id="19">When you used to trying to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult, identifying it, in connection with</seg>

<seg id="27"> Facebook would also constantly zapft of the data of its own people.</seg>
<seg id="28">The Datenteam of hand has drafted the statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentinstag, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Glücksindex</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet to the users of Facebook will know that the side to monitor it whether they want now or, order is to können allow one winter crops of the hand, the own personal data..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook Part of a survey, of who they have not yet, there is something to know;</seg>
<seg id="31">When researchers have strict set directives, how they collect their data offline, is allowed on line everything.</seg>
<seg id="32"> I do not believe that many users even on the fact, on reflection, that a researchers study their profiles, says Neil Selwyn, a social analyst on London Knowledge Lab, a study from the 2006 in he looked at the public sides on Facebook of students..</seg>
<seg id="33"> What it affects, it was just their and their true friends</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the issue of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Itself offline there are no guarantee does, that a Forschungsteilnehmer is absolutely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook but does to know it impossible as a lot of the data in a Nutzerprofil and in contributions to be true.</seg>
<seg id="37"> What is saying on Facebook and what makes one of Facebook, outside, radically different things, says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore thinks Selwyn, despite its years as Technologieforscher, a Clipboard and a pen that you have still always, that they are the best Forschungswerkzeuge, which all can use.</seg>
<seg id="39"> There is no substitute for talking to go in the real world and with real people, he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">Social research concerned to the social and a lot of social life is still offline;</seg>

<seg id="1">Urgent warnings, from the Pentagon, from possible cuts in defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Defence Minister Leon Panetta heizte the Congress Monday, and warned it not that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security by stealth. that he was a financial spiral of the halls of the Pentagons to the same way in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon already durchdenkt cuts in the level of $450 trillion in the course of the next decade, fears now that further cuts at will the creation of 600 billion dollars or more is necessary, if the Congress can achieve to conclude in the expenditure not..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, wrote Panetta in a letter on the Republican senators of John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey, with Graham, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said, is a failure of the Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, what will lead to a so-called seizure, which would lead to 23% of overall cuts and a halt of many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">So a high reduction, carried out, and on such a thoughtless kind and way of the majority of our ship, you can not to remind a ship or a building - and other much in relation, severely, wrote Panetta, the Senators, by and construction projects make unworkable</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">We had forced in addition, separating us involuntarily of a large part of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction to be implemented so quickly, should beurlauben we on security almost probably civilian, so können the objective to achieve..</seg>
<seg id="8">Such amendments to destroy the faith which, by our military, received and of our preparedness, damaging serious, and I</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts in the end will take the combat troops, said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">And the Kriegszeitkontingente in fight against terrorism has not affected by the seizure directly, of the serious intervention in the Grundbudget influence of the Kriegsbemühungen is detrimental, Myanmar Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">The recruiting process were the unjustifiable or which will be cut to the delays in the attitudes of the Einstellungsaufsicht, who are supporting the war, are introducing in the system;</seg>
<seg id="12">The salaries of the personnel reduced, what leads on late payments at Kriegszeithändler and the legal and political support would be disrupted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators answered Panetta before 10 days ago and asked to make further details on the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The consequences of a seizure Defence Ministry would begin to achieve a more rapid decline of the leading military global United States as it.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are strongly to combat this draconian act, told the senators in a joint declaration on Monday, did to a time when published Panettas letter sent it.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is a final outcome, with whom we can not live, certainly, and it is neither how we are if our backs:</seg>
<seg id="17">The seizure is not to allow a threat to the national interests of the United Statten and their commitment should:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether Panettas letter and new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise will increase in budget or demands, will provide a further boost to the Pentagon of cuts to exclude, it remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Panetta is increasingly bluntly spoken of the possible cuts, even though it need to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and white House, before he was the tip of the Pentagons, and I know that he stands to the grave decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference, in the last week of defence ministers malte a gloomy picture, what are not over yet - a military forces with skin, but without heart.</seg>
<seg id="21">There is a ship without seamen in Karachi.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is a brigade without ammunition, the</seg>
<seg id="23">There is a Luftwaffengeschwader, without sufficiently trained pilots.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is a paper to meet an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficient trained soldiers, which are in the situation, the mission said Panetta in its initial report in the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">There is a force, which it is lacking on morality and alert and the failure in the situation is to include it with potential opponents.</seg>
<seg id="26">That you can be a really angry;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Led in an annex to his letters on McCain and Graham Panetta of the new detail, as reductions of significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our global operational and Eingreiffähigkeit what leads a unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta have said that a number of the greatest Verteidigungsprojekte to delete the victim could fall itself befinden in the economy; including those who have been tested already and already in the early planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list also of the fighter pilots F35, the joint Strike part Fighter, a planned new Bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug, the Army and navy need to be replaced in the Humvee;</seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">That it reflects your repertoire never.</seg>
<seg id="32">They have been able to do so</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> I believe we could, which is partly so because we have the nine records to play, and 120 songs. all like another song and the decision, will play each hand, easily not.</seg>
<seg id="34">When we aufnehmen two or three Songs, which we have played already longer, not more, into our repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and surprise us because they are calling the reasons to remind us, why us, these Songs fell, it otherwise they could have ended up to be the ` forgotten man 'in this information;</seg>
<seg id="35">It makes to the show that is attractive for us and I think therefore also for the audience.</seg>

<seg id="41">We can argue us are enthusiastically from music of producing.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have to drive fortunately to the places of the world, which we wanted to visit always even already..</seg>
<seg id="43">The things can not be standing better..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> What it has meant for you, who is actively in the birth of Grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">There is a honour, of belonging great band to this group.</seg>
<seg id="46">Our friends well with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice, in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">That it is surprising and very unusual if a movement from a group of friends is evident.</seg>
<seg id="48">And again are a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups, at the same time from the same city brings.</seg>
<seg id="49">Is where we have honoured proud, and to our own devices, part to the Seattle-Gruppe to sein.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we play always more.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden to their tour, we welcome us, is still not friendly with them all and that honours us sein part of this arisen Seattle-Sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very unusual that a band zusammengeblieben to the with such same musicians such for a long time. - in</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">All four of us, are playing for 21 years and Matt was against legislation thirteen years ago to limit the preparation for enlargement: that alone already is much more time, and survive many band..</seg>
<seg id="54">Firstly I believe is that we appreciate all happy to us, even on life to sein, and also we look after us about each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We all are close friend, why the musical ways are opened, which give any detail to the freedom on experiments.</seg>
<seg id="56">A familiar one music and its.. it could not go to us better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship to the glory is been that are not always easy. on the other hand, her konntet make to thank your success always that, as it wanted, and</seg>
<seg id="58"> How will it strike a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The way we have developed, which has done us simple; to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We are safe, do not sein too often on tour, because it is too easy, this game with huge is a source of inspiration for millions, who love your music to sink into it.</seg>
<seg id="61">As long as one to point to think that the people, because the music, you remember this fact that you ensure, of the music and the terms it has set into lives, without this crazy sein sein a famous Rockstar. that interests are already never -</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62"> What never have to remember you in your other project, Mother Love Bone? yes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> I believe, we have very good Songs and too early it was great.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were three years long, a band which had issued by the death of Andy, never a record of the European communities;</seg>
<seg id="65">We have disappointed so far are needed to haben. do we, a friend is still well with Bruce and Greg, who were building the band with us, for this. when I understand a song or the photographs do, I think, what, for an incredible human Andy, and as it I expressed the laughter: that it was always a pleasure, going to talk together to problems, and on music and football, and many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="66">That he was an extraordinary individual and we are lacking it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The domestic volume las Robertas, are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is true, that you know their work, in particular Eddie Vedder, and the bond for the opening choice? 'he</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Indeed, the production moved us is causing by several groups, and this volume did us most.. that is why we are curious about the legal expenses, which are to see and what read Robertas on live can offer.. it is certainly exciting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why to change it, the text of Yellow Ledbetter, when its live playing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This is one question for Ed, I voted no idea.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings, and I believe that he sings the first to him like.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By whom you affects as Bassist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"></seg>
<seg id="75">On the First, which I einfallen, including Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, and C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, and Chuck Dukowski</seg>
<seg id="76">It has fallen so many that my entire afternoon on the Bassisten, which I am, to talk the Commission</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> How it was managed to Pearl Jam, as to keep the Grunge on life, even though it is no longer about a fashion phenomenon?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78"> I believe, we all feel not grateful with the word Grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">When I am reflecting me are the band, which I first mentioned for Mudhoney, Soundgarden everyone Nirvana, and the arising same time to it. if they, are also still important, I think this great, because it is worth hearing this music and bands as Mudhoney account now better music as the earlier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially their music was darker, now it is more positive..</seg>
<seg id="81">They have been able to do so</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">That it is interesting because I believe there is a few Songs on the new album, the something could work lightly.. but there are also other songs as of the End, or just Breathe, which will be classified as very dark Songs, although they also somewhat positive in itself have the year</seg>
<seg id="83">On two, I had the tears, when I was listening as Ed, they played, it are very at the same time as dark Songs;</seg>
<seg id="84"> I believe, if you will longer and more drastic in your life happens it are your artistic creation, and your music, and these two Songs it clearly supported me, for example, when one loses a families or a friend</seg>
<seg id="85"> I am also of the view that we can make a happy person and yet some dark music..</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on 16 gates that gives the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona on new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Middle of 1980er years published, the culmination of meantime disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona of those administration to their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure described to the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.</seg>
<seg id="6">He compared even in figures with the Central park of New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">The sinking of CMB in year in 1987 of the park in the view was many to restore to ceiling of Barcelona because the capital city of Catalonia one to the few, which do not spread in time, but after the top and down..</seg>
<seg id="8">The classification of Collserolas and natural park plays with this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">An example was not more of the Central park but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of Yogibärs.</seg>
<seg id="10">So far There was as the city that he was in September, a Riesenausschreibung from 16 competitions, for another Zugangstore after Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Certainly one door correctly highlights to the concept of parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either is it the case or someone has, on country to the challenge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises of themselves: Collserola, Park or Berg do</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The call for tenders is the subject for discussion in mouths of architects from Barcelona, not only from organisational point of view, but also in relation to a reflection on the city.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is already almost a rekurrentes issue, on which two members of this old eingesessenen caste, which itself are meeting in a lift, are able to resort.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it is precisely this fact will offer the substance for one of the rare consensus between the various governments, which think three architects from the Barcelona about, and some university who have to be advertised on the project, as</seg>
<seg id="17"> Miguel Roldán; Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the call for tenders is appropriate;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán that it is necessary to speak to the attack on the coast on the front on mountains, as far as the debate by Ildefons Cerda, is being fought on green apples, and</seg>
<seg id="19">We take the principle that precisely the utmost park is of beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because it is well accessible.</seg>
<seg id="21"> Collserola is more as a function of the architect, for the door of Collserola title involves a lexikalische case in we must not imagine it as access on a park, but as the definition of areas on which we need to act.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Modol how Roldán and Bayona use of high-quality public experience, quite the proposal as a intellectual challenge, the certain dangers, which poses itself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Risks resulting from the uncertainty, who brings the creation of a public area today with following the experience from the 1980er for years, which were their swan-song in the field of the forum.</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the limit on what must be developed to be.</seg>
<seg id="25">Something is to limit always, to set the next step, that means it to exceed.</seg>
<seg id="26">We must think, on new urban planning tools, because the present, lead to a genuine disaster..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Modol, the more closely the issue is, about it simplifies, the side of Collserola, which is in the direction of Vallesana, can understand as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, not, and for purely topografischen reasons:</seg>
<seg id="28"> Modol reminds, that it already have a study by employers, Mr de Collserola, which face on deaf ears, even though it is the council is stepping grateful, for it has given his body to the possibility, this project from the first moment to be involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">He realises also, that the vicinity of mountain life on city in the Geleitbrief is the enabling of the architects, to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubt, which will determine whether the technical profile, guiding the multidisciplinary teams created into lives, we rather should only be a tool, at</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Bayona indicates that the answer on the question in the title of this article is complex, when the tender conditions of a global vision of Collserola at the moment: it tender 16 competitions in cross-section, he says, on the axis Gebirge-Meer.</seg>
<seg id="31">It has held at least in his case to the Council, that it is participating in the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the programme to some conflict and the definition of a project for a door with the architect of the Tors in addition.</seg>
<seg id="33">Its opinion is that the city to guarantee it is important, that the strip directly is above the Ronda de Dalt is in its whole out so, which is a soft transition between it creates the city and Grünzonen.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his presentation Schlaglöcher, both from a technical point of view, he considered, on the occasion of the international year on chemicals, he was aware that the laboratory for which it is responsible, is developing into modified Asphalte with Polymeren, in order to establish the asphalt with the same mixture, which however has a greater mechanical resistance, both in high and also in low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extreme hot climate, how countries of the north of the cities in certain such being spent, so to improve the behaviour of the road surface is, avoid, the incidence of Schlaglöchern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said, that the asphalt is a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, of who is a part of a high Molekulargewicht and the other part is a low - which is so these Malthene, the most serious part of oil the so-called Asphaltene</seg>

<seg id="9">Of the researchers, the FQ said, the road of Mexico City, a majority would have a flexible Straßenbelag, itself zusammensetze from six Materialschichten, of which the last three asphalt involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the classes, a Verschleißschicht lies, for asphalt, who would insist from small, gebadeten in asphalt and then hardened stones.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">Every single piece of these Verschleißschicht, was been with all my clothes on, being in asphalt, which is</seg>
<seg id="12">When the vehicles must to proceed, and forces produced, this class allows a good Kräfteverteilung in Straßenbelag.</seg>
<seg id="13">If it, would be amended asphalt, the forces would become to distribute even better, thought the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">On the Verschleißschicht, it has led, will be interpreted to a final layer, who is so this Tragschicht, which is from tiny stones, that is from sand the was also with all my clothes on, being in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Given this class in contacts with the car tyres, must produce it is a greater mechanical force as the Verschleißschicht and they must friction..</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Which receives of these Straßenbelag of the most forces and to some extent; the Tragschicht is being distributed, is required to keep an appropriate thickness and the material, from where they is also..</seg>

<seg id="17">The weather has said in particular water and temperature changes, are other, important, too taken into account factors, first of all things to the water, he because there does the behaviour of Verschleißschicht is considerable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the premises is as wet, as a matter of urgency of water in the class and is as just difficult once again, that causes a relaxing of sections of the road surface is, and consequently, the emergence of Schlaglöchern.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a Schlagloch, he said, will be flattened to begin the Deckschicht, while the Verschleißschicht will only then affect.. however, the damage is emerging not immediately, but it is a process, in the first signs by appropriate Wartungsprogramme should be kept.</seg>

<seg id="20">The members of the Council Sistema Nacional de Investigadores said that the Fahrzeuglast is another important cause for the incidence of Schlaglöchern. therefore had the thickness of any class of the road surface is, always, there are regarding Fahrzeuglast in the relationship and it must be ensured, that for preventing it will be complied with this regulation of frequent Schlaglöchern..</seg>

<seg id="12">Currently I read 'fault and expiation within programmes. There is a book to be undertaken by the universal culture, which should read we; I read just to a paper of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, to a beautiful book, the ` way ', in other words.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">An answer which has itself civilise to little think firstly because the term 'and secondly because they not specifically said, influenced of each book of their mentioned be based on the way it, in the course of</seg>
<seg id="14">However after the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina said, is to feel calm and happy to the result: the universe that is wise, it will happen, which needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="15">And everyone people: lest I ask a little bit ` the small prince '. it is great to promote books;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Under other things being said, that the Liebling ausgebrannt of El Valle;</seg>
<seg id="17">Indicated and had the other candidates of making jealously, stresste what the Queen people who are therefore of stage could not shine.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And realised you in its first idea in Badeanzug on beach of the Hilton Hotel, and its two lifts in the Krönungsfeier..</seg>
<seg id="19">Although they appeared sure in two, it surely was missing the force and the impetus, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did to being broadcast.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme as the direction casa when Channel felt RCN that the fact shows, that Melina for Miss World has been crowned with the fact that the candidate has been nominated, which is gaining during the competition of the most prices, not, will surely her finally..</seg>
<seg id="21">In addition, Valle was the closure of the press from the way - a mistake to make.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince for the social work of the Jurie on their interest, what ultimately is the most important thing of national beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">It already is his reason, that two days before the compilation of international jury covers Lucy Doughty, said it sought a woman who is committed for the social affairs of country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Beauty alone is for a Miss World Colombia. we must look beyond to focus on the Körperliche and the social perception, it is the fact that it has worked already before the participation on competition on projects, said them</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is speculation also, that Valle was sinned with their faults of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which it said in the Magengegend of tackling it, being; but it is a contradiction that it has selected because the jury as candidate for ` natural beauty 'with a healthy bodies, good in eating habits and good physical work;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Put some fact that Melina was not the best body that it better existed, but their problem with the Fibrose on gut, which was said to be honest to say for me little, the coach of the Königinnen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, to their marks on the last day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist to Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is the view, the fault of the madam from Valle del Cauca if the surgical intervention, which they had subjected itself, on this.</seg>
<seg id="28">The operations they are OK, Valle was aware, as they are making it is right.</seg>
<seg id="29">Your body never is to have their strong side, they have to pay, and take this opportunity, at</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because this prices, the idea of the first time to grant the national beauty contest, came about after the appearance in Badeanzug of a cruel forecasts, which it should be, in the night. it has getuschelt of the word, so that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, so not in the from the crown they is coming;</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Regardless whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is now on not of their Herrschaftsjahr, certainly as Queen, but as Princess, a position, which it offers the possibility, of representing to the appointment of the national beauty contest of Colombia in one of the international game shows.</seg>
<seg id="32">But they will do as one of the Königinnen, the idea was escaped of the crown, despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena, in the history eingehen.</seg>

<seg id="7">The progress that has been achieved within fifteen years, are considerable:</seg>
<seg id="8">Then, the unemployment was not twice, but a triple such great:</seg>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless remains enormous much to be done.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">We say, however, that disabled unemployed still many obstacles to stay, before they are getting a work..</seg>
<seg id="11">More, it is the older people: 37% older than for 50, are of transport by the year.</seg>
<seg id="12">They are on a low level of qualification: 80% they have no baccalaureate and it are only 10, 000 people under the 2.3 millions of students with higher qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, it is also the long-term unemployment to be very widespread: 53%, the people with disabilities with 38% in Gesamtschnitt.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, there are so many criteria, which make a new Arbeitseinstieg, and which are the very essence of the problem, as Christian Grapin, the director-General of Tremplin, of a 1992 should be formed of reunification, the business in help is disabled of working people using.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So to the factual brakes;</seg>

<seg id="19">This latter, the figures, which dates from the year in 2008 to point out on a Quotienten of 2.6%;</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Of the 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure to the companies, said Pierre Blanc.</seg>
