Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.

So far, the project is more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes.

<seg id="34">
The magic word is variability.

But most came the following advice: "first of all, you know what the rules are perfect."

"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.

<p>
<seg id="40">
At last, it is clear to me why we need pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if you fashion journals often quite different to see.

Not to mention of fashion schaus.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed.

<seg id="43">
So you have to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to stylen at least 15.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
All of this must be expected in the form of the attire.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
That image and sometimes make up half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.

We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
But how it is used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but overall, the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of unbegreiflichen laziness in principle laziness of the games developers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The adventure begins very well.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Firstly, it will be introduced into the story, whose main character, Jack certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than fifty individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This means that each race will be fought on the other route and that the various stages in different degrees, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
There is no moment the impression that the game would continue to offer the same thing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Some areas are still very nicely, even though the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So nothing to write home about.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But the journey through the desert, autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Every now and again bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the desert, for example, will be surprised by a desert storm, which is the point of view.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the mountains, in turn, must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Only a few, but they are.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This is more about certain interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing anybody else, and where he must help the players, the right button at the right moment.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
So nothing complicated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It is surprising, however, that there is much less such passages in the game, as one would expect (actually only three).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Ultimately, it is more likely to advantage, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In other words, from today's viewpoint, no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be a bad thing.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren, the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well, although we could be in the competition.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In the meantime, so far, everything is fine.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Real problems only after a certain time.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not quite OK.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
> From a game of this type, it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate deformations and collisions, but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is, then it is obviously not everything is in order.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
A typical example: the close or passing of oncoming cars "touched upon" the other car in some places only slightly in the other, almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Or the Karre to scrap.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more, it is annoying.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The remaining Arts are resolved: if you write-off or far away from the route, then the game back to the last point of reference.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Only - in every race has only five restarts.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
If they are exhausted, everything is going on.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The restarts are more such as a tool for the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it should not.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Sometimes, however, does not help the Restart, there is nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Some curves must be, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Elsewhere, the appropriate place "civilian" cars are always in the same configuration, no matter whether it was the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but even there, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And it does not matter when you arrive, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
The opponents have other advantages.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
In the game, there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents, and again without regard to the timing.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
The most madman's is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which is happening in the opposite direction.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And if he is already facing a, then he is the point of view, of course, so that they their own car a few times in Klump.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
Clearly, we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And that is a pity, because despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
And, in principle, no matter what "guilt" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can boredom, or something completely different...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
We must not overlook garages, because it is precisely here that we can change the car, even though in most cases, the car is enough.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
The cars are divided into three categories.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the aufgaben mode (challenges) - the race in the individual which we know from history.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
This is not just medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, the common tasks (challenges) and history.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
In order to achieve higher driver, must be open to various objects: from the car to the baker's grounds for the profile.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
This is at the same time, the role of online Autolog which, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players, and also provides for more collective functions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
This is the car in a subway tunnel (a), where in the dark on the rails long (a).
</seg>
<seg id="72">
On the tachograph paragraphs between 150 200 km/h (say), but there is an underground and an uncompromising to scrap.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
In our editorial, we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of game makers, or whether the authors for so stupid.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is, in most cases, appealing, and here and there, even brilliant.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments, the wiederhol rate is slower, and sometimes quite dramatically.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
This is particularly the accidents with greater numbers of do, where a continuous FPS anyway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
The Tonwiedergabe is OK, and the sound track is a matter of taste.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
In a bid to such a broad as possible rather young audience, a sound track a lá "of all things" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
The overall impression of Need for steroids: The run? The feelings are more mixed.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
But the game somehow unfinished.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye.

EU ambassador Vicenová:

The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics

<p>
<seg id="3">
"The Treaty of Lisbon has upset the balance among the various institutions felt out the road."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
I would not have expected that there is such a hard war flares. "
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It will take five or six years, until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation at the law faculty.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of her speech, in which it was the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"It is a man of twenty-seven member states listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.

The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said that the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number, I call? "as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Mrs Vicenová also on the agenda, according to the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In the case of the government during the presidency, describing it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome quite hectic.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And since the seven-year budget must be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Whether it is a slim and economical budget, what industries take precedence, which countries more and less - all of this is now on the agenda.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"If I do not like something, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.

It would have used the territory of the European Union in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
The Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics more negative than positive aspects of the story.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least the weak support for the Czech side.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and, in the vicinity, then the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is the heads together - that is your V4? "and makes a pretty sour face.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the member states.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.

"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should work together, and it does not want to out."

"It will be more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "expects Mrs Vicenová.

In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.

Fire story:
</seg>
<seg id="2">
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="3">
If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, even though a century has passed since its inception.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The basis for this longevity has been its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson,.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He was the slogan, countless global problems could easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
His slogan "Think!" has become the hallmark, which should take the life of the future giant (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, IBM in the year 1935 began).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away changing everything else around it.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technology to transform the business and society.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Thought-out system
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman, Virginia Rometty.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
It is already 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and strategy manager.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
IBM makes so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
No wonder - ideas, it is enough, the company is almost half a million people.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
An institution with a good reputation
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Their steadfast position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and domestic and foreign.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"From the outset, IBM is the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve," said George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The company pointed out, there is a difference, only to be present on the market or directly through this presence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
IBM - in the states of their logos because of the family "Big Blue ," has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
It is one of the militaries technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
With approximately 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second major technology company (after Apple), but it was the first time since 1996, Microsoft took over.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Looking ahead
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service, for example, or even the IBM PC computers jr.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not be emotional attachment to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
That is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave again.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system Windows.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Promising technologies
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">
The profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, 58 billion dollars in the future technologies.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the middle of the global economic crisis increased its investment.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and the profit of the company kontinuell grows.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
The company slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
For that reason, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
IBM history: from cheese Schneider to space flights
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
A hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
According to the name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
According to the foundation for the subsequent society IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history dates back in the 1980s of the 19th century.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board of directors.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him with the management of the company.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson's ideas based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
Watson led the company until 1952.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
IBM began, as the name tells us, in the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.

Development of the travel prices since 1989
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern bloc countries in the West at that time were chosen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why were severely restricted the trips to Yugoslavia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
It was a great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel was not possible.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but had to be huge queues or even in the sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
So the matter was still a long time.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The czechoslovak currency was not free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange promise, it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
> from the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Tschechoslowaken could have a long time of their trips to the West simply enough, everyone wanted at least a few days there have been.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
For example, the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a with canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Our standard of living and the average salaries rose to 1997, which einmündete in another important moment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - after Thailand.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Since then, every year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel each year in exotic countries!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development came in 2008.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
In 2008, the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday more than 15 CZK per capita.

The main assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
To date, there is still no agreement on how the electoral law is to be elected.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
And without, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
In June Hašek resigned from his post, and his colleagues in the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
However, in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers were once again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This was clearly on 16 September, when the new chairman should be chosen.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The delegates of the main assembly were in vain in the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial produced no result, and it was not just about the election itself.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
You could not agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for state and law, whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to persist.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the issue in meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Even if the views in relation to the election of a few times - the worst point remained the same.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"The issue is the question of whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
According to registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the victor in this percentage vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
"The two Vorrunden make no sense, this modus operandi would, the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best not to bend the electoral law, but to choose under current statutes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Surprisingly, this is also true Tomáš Paclík, even if it seems that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"My wish is that as much as possible will be in accordance with the statute."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football clubs) Victoria Plze, who is standing for the first time, above all in its opinions from to Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In his opinion, will be known in Nymburk the new chairman, and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"If the football on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten has the most experience on both professional and regional levels.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Rajchl is more restrained.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, ambivalent."
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Only - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals until the qualification will be at all.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all and so feverish for an alternative option as a part of the executive committee to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
Ultimately, it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.

If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up the election."
</seg>
<seg id="42">
"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find an Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the top of the FAČR.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Paclík also stressed that he if he wins the role of chairman, only one year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced "not too much involved in the football.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"With some of the people I have spoken personally."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"Hard to believe that some people said that they do not want to identify with the Czech football.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
The most of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."
</seg>
<seg id="52">
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, would be doubly bad football," said Paclík.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of Pelta (tsch) should play football."
</seg>
<seg id="55">
"And how we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will be," but it looks a little more calmly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
If Paclík in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"He has great skills."
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
</seg>
<seg id="62">
"I am not my nose in matters, which I understand," said Paclík, who was in September for attention that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment, and to a certain cultivation of this."
</seg>
<seg id="66">
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which descends into horrific situations ," which makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, in which he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in sport.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."
</seg>
<seg id="69">
"When it comes to the taxation of happiness, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money is going," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he pointed out, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
</seg>
<seg id="72">
"It is not ideal."
</seg>
<seg id="73">
"It is not my opinion but much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the case of his election, that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
Pelta had not realized election in September, he wants to focus in the case of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and it might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
"People at all levels dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
</seg>
<seg id="80">
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man who is associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
He is convinced that the current problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
"Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as complete as it had adopted.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
If they do not allowed to different interpretations, we would have had a chairman, "said Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">
It is the revision of the most important document of the citizens" association he used as bait for the delegates.
</seg>
<seg id="86">
"I should be president, then I take it personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
</seg>
<seg id="87">
"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponents.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">
It also Tomáš Paclík attack, for a long time, which has no dry thread Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
In football, he has more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
</seg>
<seg id="92">
"His attacks were herabsetzend, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
</seg>
<seg id="93">
"This is also why many doubt its true nature," adressierte Pelta his opponent, who will remain faithful to its proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
</seg>
<seg id="96">
"I would also like to try to put an end to all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
</seg>
<seg id="97">
"I would like to negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funds for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football will mean no human cleansing.
</seg>
<seg id="99">
"I would have been familiar with the content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
"If you really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."
</seg>
<seg id="102">
"Football needs credibility and he is the only if he finally has a new leader," remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him to work hard begins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">
If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood.
</seg>
<seg id="105">
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard.
</seg>
<seg id="106">
He wants to introduce systemic changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.
</seg>
<seg id="107">
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">
"As chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole."
</seg>
<seg id="109">
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football for the young people. "
</seg>
<seg id="110">
"I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area."
</seg>
<seg id="112">
And I will be distributing tough tasks, so that the football in every segment is moving forward. "
</seg>
<seg id="113">
Moreover, many not just delighted, because they, rather than to criticize the work of others, should begin to work really hard, "he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have not to stand at all.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
</seg>
<seg id="116">
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
</seg>
<seg id="117">
"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do it."
</seg>
<seg id="118">
"This is confidence that we must not squander," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">
It is allegedly motivated him, should be able to continue the work he has begun under Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="120">
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not just throw away."
</seg>
<seg id="121">
"There have been trials started only in a few years to play, and I would like to see someone cut off," he said, and expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek could return.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">
"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something that does not Mirek Pelta."
</seg>
<seg id="123">
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
</seg>
<seg id="124">
I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "
</seg>
<seg id="125">
"I am trying to be objective."
</seg>
<seg id="126">
"I want football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">
It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
<seg id="128">
"Even if some people say the opposite, I have to do what is best for Moravia."
</seg>
<seg id="129">
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners in each of the first league."
</seg>
<seg id="130">
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected.
</seg>
<seg id="132">
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations with the lottery law as its success.
</seg>
<seg id="133">
On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association was not in a single direction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">
While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
</seg>
<seg id="135">
"No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
</seg>
<seg id="136">
"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has begun, and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
</seg>
<seg id="137">
He would certainly not want to altered just on his favour, "Rajchl ruling on his rivals.

When Iris Meder in the past one and a half years on research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.

Agricultural speculation

German bank leaves commodity business

<seg id="4">
The Deutsche Bank business with agricultural commodities?
</seg>
<seg id="5">
According to online information, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
In January, the CEO's wants to draw conclusions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Hamburg.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans for the German citizens find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for the global hunger problem.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Commodity bets were originally intended for traders hedge against price fluctuations.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
But now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is worth it "the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
By the end of the year is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what consequences.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
In the end, could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Ackermann fusses over his image
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, however, his criticism of the financial industry: "the betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks today, the common good."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, especially in the duty.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"No matter whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the German Bank."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And it needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Every second would cancel commodity crops
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
On Tuesday, Bode published the poll, for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities, where bets on food prices.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: Every second, according to the survey would terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution.

An architectural history with ups, downs and happy ending: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958 prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and descended.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Now, he is being reopened as an exhibition house.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo 1958 is a good and famous example.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The building is seen as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion built.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he became internationally famous.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion of the world Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20s home" has been called it.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
This was the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, until the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
On Tuesday night, the museum opened Belvedere, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Husslein-Arco, doctorate art historian with considerable career, among other things, in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, strongly defended the with politicians and conservationists monument, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and use.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Besides contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop, it should be, and an office house had to be built.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Strict supervision, small budget
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
It is not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition, but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him, "enormously important place ," where he" almost every weekend "the exhibitions.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He knew the draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In the current restructuring, there were far greater problems: the building was "an Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Kältebrücken steel girders have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road for the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The original exterior doors are left, the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"Often a material had to be found, which is a good thing, and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive soil in -.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Despite all the constraints, problems and to the building is flexible and easy.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "the came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "drop in history."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
So an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a real awareness."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
In this case, the 21er house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: if the Swiss garden is completely new planned "Central Station Quartier," with office and residential buildings.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And another stroke will occur: the 21er house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and we hear that they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.

So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett always said, not to invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the firms only bad forecast.

He had much earlier must understand that IBM implied in particular services and computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.

The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
This news will be in Turkey and in the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For many German türken returns with a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The right-wing extremist network reveals, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.

</p>
<p>

"The bloody ideology?" the headline on the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haber Turk. "
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The newspaper Sabah, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.

As a slap in the face, because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the series of murders.

<seg id="18">
It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their later investigative success.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Why the German authorities would not have much more to look in extreme right-wing circles for suspects, the authors were surprised.

<seg id="20">
Some shows, at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces."

</seg>
<seg id="24">
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
</seg>

The attacks, however, the attacks we sense on the Turkish side.

The mistakes of the past are not repeated

In the Turkish press was particularly at the time, above all, the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.

The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Now it is to be a German.

<seg id="9">
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."

But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different.

A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.

<p>
<seg id="12">

<p>
<seg id="14">
It became known that Weber, the bank of February 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.

</p>
<p>

For Axel Weber will be hard.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
He is not a banker, economics professor and central banker, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again that they have long been the title "the greatest scandal bank of Europe ."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Nothing, it seems, is the once proud Swiss bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
It started in the financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
This made sense.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "I have the UBS was regarded as a model of a good bank."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"From today's perspective, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
He was wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In 2007, it was the first time that something went wrong in the UBS.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli, which was, as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
But was actually investors, however, some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft: an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that not even his name.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
But that was only the first blow.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In April 2008, there have been worse.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The National bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan, on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she saw how dramatic it is for a small country, if it is so big banks.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banking researcher says.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
The first disaster was the second.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business, including criminal premium.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
In doing so, the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board President.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And the exodus of customers" money.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
For example, the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios: investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will now have to get it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
And it is obvious that the risk management in the investment banking, it is still not clear.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.

<seg id="56">
The financial chief of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."

</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">

</seg>
<seg id="78">
When you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.

<seg id="79">
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks, with a huge corporation.

Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top."
</seg>
<seg id="86">
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models are the reality," He says.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
"This is a tragic case."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
Tragic, perhaps.

It is clear: frolic came before the case.

In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that they almost claimed the existence.

It became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and did so at - but also risks.

Mass slaughter on a personal level
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book "beauty and horror. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of players to heart.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these people as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of your illusions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
"Beauty and horror" almost war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
Some of these people are heroes.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Some prisoners of war, lose limb, crazy or die.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just the devastating war on the Western Front.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
This is a very moving book almost from the outset.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of Kordit.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Who is at all?
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"There is a lack of facts," Englund says, "with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other already published material.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very vivid in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Many of them act of shortages and Behelfen.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
He tells us of the dinner in Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes, which were besohlt with wood."
</seg>
<seg id="32">
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "one feels that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so as a front civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or will be done.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Other observations of the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
</seg>
<seg id="40">
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century ":" the word and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"The grotesque expression can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but intrusiveness and fits perfectly with its human task.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in an unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
The best books about the First World War were distorted were distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "nothing new" in the West as a comprehensive history books.

The complaint is probably the last chance, the union, District council 37, in their efforts to make the redundancies, is still open.

The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.

In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or to make a proper justice after the alleged attack.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Burke says it has the top military leadership, because the problem is there.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Burke also says that she has since February nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Their strategy: instead that all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.
</seg>

The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint.

On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for violations that soldiers on active service.

Things have changed since the 1950s.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact with indigenous women in war zones.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
And it is not alone in their fight: three other complaints their are pending.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
At Yale Law School, the veteran "Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused in the service.

But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.

<seg id="39">
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I thought that it would be. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his procedure, and that was my trial."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
In January 2010, it was sacked dishonourable, so that they have no support.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
</seg>
<seg id="52">
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it has been called into question.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
The military is a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, which is a liability.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try."
</seg>
<seg id="56">
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.

Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.

Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But, as we find them?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This is easy - you need only log on Facebook.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups throughout Europe and visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or to connect a new diet product Adds invited users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their office.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
With more than 800 million active users, on average three content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"If you previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more problem than students who remained silent on this issue.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, residential adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many status updates.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found in a different way."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Facebook also zapft the data of its own people.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The data team has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used primarily on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have a long time that the side of their large data treasure trove for others available for research purposes.) 
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not. with a friend, thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, the side's own personal data.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know something?
</seg>
<seg id="31">
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"What they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Then there is the question of methodology.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in an user profile and in speeches.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"Social research must take care of the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."

"Cold and inhumane ": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Unlike Behring Breivik, the man who has been two amok, which this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, has himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" to fight.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideologies and because it is supported by the multiculturalism."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For the same reason, he refused to Breivik, a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody, he will be four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
All took part with the aim that everything on a Wegschließen.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard the suspects."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered and left the building.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
It may be some that the attacks of 22 July, apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
But that automatically the sadness and confusion, of a whole nation still?

7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is how this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of thought ,"" a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
In 1995, Bob Cringely the TV series "triumph of the specialist idiots" on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than a hour with jobs, in a rare, detailed discussions.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs have been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
Only after jobs death we discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Mark theatre.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
And incredibly thoughtful.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, in which jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
There are also moments in which Jobs" perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst, faster on issues or actions of greater importance.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies in his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap to the grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
He has a vision of how things could and should.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Shortly after he had said that everything, he set off and made it.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
As he learned to run a business:
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"During the years I always ask:" Why are you doing things? "and the answer you get is," Oh, it is made easy. "
</seg>
<seg id="21">
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really carefully about things.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
I have noticed that.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs ," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with" deviation "- he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs in minute.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
As the Pope was veralbert:
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Jobs told of the "Blue Box ," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls in vain.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T network in another, while so many satellites as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the telephone, there was a minute later in the telephone next door," kichernd told jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Jobs have been told from a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
As he is in the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
</seg>
<seg id="35">
In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. it was the only company that I had seen in the age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Later jobs was one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was "the first desktop computers ever produced."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun tube and I fell in love with him.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
How innovation improves:
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Several times in the interview speaks about how we invent new products.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Early in his career, when he einbaute some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse:
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I remember resounding arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Ninety days later we had a mouse, which we are building for $15. it was incredibly credible.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
On large companies.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Long before he saw Apple revived, jobs are the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions and lost control of their shares.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopying or printer, well?"
</seg>
<seg id="51">
They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product, in which people are being squeezed out of the decision-making process.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
The product genius that has led to this monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no concept about good products versus bad products, eradicated - craft art.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
This happened at Xerox...
</seg>
<seg id="55">
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
It could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...
</seg>
<seg id="57">
They have caught the defeat from victory.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
On innovation as an art form:
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... If you develop this great idea, they change and grow."
</seg>
<seg id="60">
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
We must make votes, certain things that you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
</seg>
<seg id="62">
We must note 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together....
</seg>
<seg id="63">
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it is to that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to get these things together, which makes it possible.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.

Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts of $450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress can reach a conclusion in the spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a way that would make most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, "said Panetta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support the war."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which leads to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">

"It is a brigade without ammunition."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"It is an air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to compete with potential opponents."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"You can be angry."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global commitment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
And Panetta said that some of the removal of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
This list also includes Fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new litt oral combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.

The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic collapse.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of the government.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
It is expected that he will present a cabinet by the majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take up his office.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former European Commissioner journalists.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Monti confirmed not explicitly the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The "framework is now well established," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis, the cost of debt in an intolerable level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new government led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the euro politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The pressure to rush to Monti, reinforced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years, with 7% interest. This is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue package.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "we said we would support this government on all sides."
</seg>
<seg id="14">
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy from this emergency situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The chances of success Monti's have increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"We believe that the efforts of professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of technocrats government, particularly the.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Support from Parliament
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Opposition to his efforts, or the delay of the reforms could lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The Italian Association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure was a disaster, also pressure.

</p>

Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers" associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Tuesday evening, the session is to be completed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
After a sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Monti said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Monti said he would like to see politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Thank you, all these years on our side.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
We have spent nearly 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and we are very sorry to have waited so long to have taken so long, until we came here.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Some of the greatest shows that we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
We have played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we are prepared for this concert in Costa Rica.
</seg>

Since we have never played, we have no borders.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and our fans a good and varied repertoire.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
It is never repeated your repertoire.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
I think that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
If we have two or three songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they are the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten.

This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.

</seg>
<seg id="37">
If you look back, it is hard to believe in your success?

<seg id="38">
Yes, totally.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band, and more than 20 years, and it looks like a dream.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
We continue on this blessing, and it is great to be able to make music together.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large bands.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
We are good with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
It is surprising and very unusual, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
Every now and then a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time, come from the same city.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Sometimes we still play together.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound garden on their tour. We are pleased to be friendly with them all and honoured to be part of this past Seattle Sound.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago, together with the same musicians.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, and that It is a lot more time than many bands survive.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care about each other.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
How do you find a balance?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created, must be careful not to be a famous rock star, and that has never interested.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
I think we have very good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
We were three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and music and football, and many other issues.
</seg>
<seg id="66">
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.

</p>

Who you got to be affected as Bassist?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
So many +
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
</seg>
<seg id="76">
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the bassists, which I could talk about.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
As Pearl jazz Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards, nirvana and all the others that were at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they also have something positive.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
Both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed played, and it is very dark Song's.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music.

Park or mountain?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
It has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who does not spreading in the south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The classification Collserolas as a natural park is playing with this idea.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
As a model is now no longer the Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of a park.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Either that, or someone has to make gates in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And it is precisely this fact provides the for one of the rare similarities between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Among other things, because it is accessible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" gates of Collserola lexikalische "" lexikalische trap ": it must not "as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that "the number of risks."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the forum "swan song."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The first fear is his own limits on what can be developed.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e. to exceed it.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [references to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Modol, closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, in the direction of Valle sana, "can be understood as a park, not at Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he his "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says)," we architects should only be a tool. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola: "there have been advertised 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountain sea. but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This has, at least in his case that he is taking part in the 16 competitions.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length is a soft transition between city and green zones.

<p>
<seg id="3">
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The public is invited to take part in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests with children and young people.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) began since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal state México) will continue.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family illness history, risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency, to control.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77 percent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," said the expert of the IMSS.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, European and 30 to 5 percent of African descent in the genes, which is associated with diabetes and obesity,.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so that this will be stored in the form of fat.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, the lack of movement on a daily basis, most of the time of the day in front of the television and means of transport to go, rather than short routes.

Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The which stem from the road surface, respected, it would not be required to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags happen, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"Potholes from a technical point of view," he in his speech on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing, in a similar mixture, but the asphalt mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, such as, for example, in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C, it is very liquid and 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," said the chemical engineer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface, which is composed of six layers of material, which included the last three asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt, which is made up of small and then solidified stones bathed in asphalt.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Each piece this decay class, was bathed in asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
If the vehicles to move and forces produced this situation is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"If it is modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The erosion," he said, "is being interpreted in a recent class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, which was also in asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Since this situation in contact with the car tyres, they need greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The road surface receives the most forces and distributed, the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which it must be maintained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, above all, the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
If the site is damp, water in the class and only difficult, and this is a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result, the incidence of stroke holes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
If a pothole, "he said," will initially cover layer worn out, while the wear layer that will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system Mexico) said that the burden of another important reason for the appearance of blow holes. It is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that frequent potholes with this rule will be met.
</seg>

Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve Asphaltemulsionen, for example, which in other countries are already on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures.

With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had been kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
</seg>
</p>
<p>

The big question many are asking is: What was missing?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any demonstration had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not in vain to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia home.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "what book has most influenced and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, was not convinced.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a kind of civilised way, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for my childhood," the little prince "is a very profound book.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
At the moment I read "guilt and atonement." it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says'passions'.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
An answer, which was met with skepticism, firstly because of the term'civilised" and, secondly, because it had not explained how each of the book had affected them.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result: "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And for all people: please read a little bit of "The small prince '; it is a great book.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is charred.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously what the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage."

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Although it appeared in both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but will not be queen."
</seg>
<seg id="21">
In addition, Valle was at the end of the press - a mistake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the back, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgery, which she had undergone.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they get it right.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a cruel prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come to the enjoyment of the crown.

<p>
<seg id="31">
Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions.

Denmark is an European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are its CO2 Ausstösse, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.

Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion.

This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.

<seg id="13">
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by exerted pressure on their wages.

However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job.

Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0,9%.

And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (high proportion of immigrants naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).

The migrants also contribute to the social systems in European countries, on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget.

Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe unites directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The German Chancellor, Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel, which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which the region of st. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
A second pipeline, which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
And the possibility of building a third pipeline of themselves.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult For them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
This, however, at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are becoming exhausted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," said François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen contracts from political and economic side are important.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
We also had to be taken more measures to protect the fauna and flora.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, or maintenance stations.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from it, as the Swedes were little eager to a Russian state company in a permanent way to their coasts.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
In the case of a leak gas in the gas pipeline escapes, into the air.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This case comes from the designers, however, as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot, controlled by an of from external virtue purposes, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
This is 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Five companies have combined their efforts to achieve this project.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (to 9%).
</seg>
<seg id="41">
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real from transporting volume," added Mr Müller.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
The financing of the baus gas pipeline to 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
The minority shareholders are, however, gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
The gas pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
The 4.5 metres high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
</seg>
<seg id="51">

</seg>
<seg id="52">
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour.

Moleskine, a notiz marker.
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
> From an Italian company about 15 years, Moleskine would like to give back new style to the letter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
It has a flair for adventure, by candlelight with the letter spent hours.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
The notice of Moleskine is easily recognizable, with his black, rechteckigen cover, his elastic, eierschalfarbenen sides, such as aged over time.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The Moleskine note book, as we know it today, however, has been created in 1997.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided at that time, a distinguiert designer notiz book on the market.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Maria Sebregondi, technical adviser of the company, is charged with the market introduction of the new product.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The notiz book was inspired by a traditional production technology, called mole skinhead (mole skin), which described a Baumwollack, for example, will be used for salary padded benches.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
This kind of notiz book was among writers and travellers.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
"Moleskine has an old and almost forgotten subject to revive until the 20th century as icon pioneering artists was," explained Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for Modo Modo.

<seg id="12">
Between 2006 and 2010, the sales increase by 26% and establish itself with sales of 12.7 million.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
This is a far cry from the usual production in the first few years, in which only 3,000 record books were conceived.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Moleskine is the Italian border and will be carried out in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is difficult to prepare a phantom image of the buyer, as the book notice businessmen, as well as students and professionals.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Moleskine has the image more cosmopolitan, cultured and intellectual customers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The small Italian company, which in its early days was among 12 workers, now employs more than 100 employees and has been in place since 2008 on two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of town centres and understands its identity.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"We have followed the spirit and his new desk needs, despite the recovery of the e-mails," said Maria Sebregondi.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
This cultural trait which is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand exposure called "Detour (route)," in which architects and artists their own notebooks.

Moleskine benefited from his success and the cultural zeitgeist and showed it to diversify its products: pockets, diary, pen, computer... The brand, the whole range of articles.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
A success, there are some begrudgers brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006, Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and suggested that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.

Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people in such a high level?

About 19% of disabled people are searching for a job.

<seg id="3">
Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Despite the purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population.

"The fifteen years of progress."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
More often, it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
</seg>
<seg id="12">
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students in higher education.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the "heart of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The latter, from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6%.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"We are now at about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
"The law of 2005, which provides increases, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."

"But this improvement is also a real awareness, especially among the large firms groups."

The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism about the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.

The Hinspiel had both teams lacked objectivity.

For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.

In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken.

"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets.

<seg id="18">
"We will be able to compete against a team, the high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
