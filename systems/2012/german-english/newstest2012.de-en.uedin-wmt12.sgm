<seg id="1">Libyan victory</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows their losers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Muammar al-Qaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him, the war is over.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Now, the winners are only to define.</seg>
<seg id="5">As the region is him triumph in the elections, Islamists, the question just that - the moderate or radical.</seg>
<seg id="6">The National Transitional Council committed itself to the customary law of Scharīʿa, of which there is now a certain idea of God.</seg>
<seg id="7">Libya would be a country without crime, because for theft from one in short hoe.</seg>
<seg id="8">Women should forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, possibly believe renegade are executed, and so on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Instead of a single dictator society from each other feuding tribes will be united in the future from the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="10">In short - in Libya will be an order that over here and especially hard to imagine hardly desirable.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively speaking, probably not the best schedule and would fit the Libyans.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this respect, it is rather surprising that the Muslim fighters could help at all of the infidel dogs.</seg>
<seg id="13">In their defence, the fact may only serve that NATO's bombardments were not guided by any general from America, but from Allah, whose omnipotence was hailed after every successful hit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The victors in Libya?, the West is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="15">We just participated in a shooting incident, served the interests of Islam and our politicians reasserted themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit would have brought.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw instead of a military occupation of Libya.</seg>
<seg id="17">As a result, the hiesigen are a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.</seg>
<seg id="18">The oil companies but also without occupation of the black gold to the silver?</seg>
<seg id="19">Hardly, and so the West can boast once with right his generosity in protecting human rights.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn I had a bit gemeckert that that was a bit too much stuff for the start.</seg>
<seg id="3">I was not aware at all, what is yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how it is "on the square."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It to get much worse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Ever closer examination, the more information and practical tasks lie before us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But even if of course everyone weekends, he is shown yet.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we debated it on course with director (not a single man participates), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And, after all, most of us.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some have a short neck, the other too jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are rather tubby.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is up to conceal the Stylisten, broad shoulders look to extend the neck or hervorzuzaubern the necessary curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We also got pointers as a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - with great bosom, broad hip and fine slim waists - nicely and figure attracts said, without being too provocative acts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If the difference between slim waists and waists, for instance, is so great that the skirt or trousers fit really not, it should be at least adjust a bit after level.</seg>
<seg id="14">This will not regret it safely, because well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made rock one feels much high and verrutscht better than in an off-the-shelf, which constantly in the slim waists absteht, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Jungenhafte characters, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, construction Chen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have to go a whole week time to leave me everything thoroughly by the head.</seg>
<seg id="18">And yet I am afraid that it is not to create in the face of assigned homework almost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the course participants inside was allocated a Promi, for which it is to devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe.</seg>
<seg id="20">We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the relevant stars and its Figurtyp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I should attract Miranda Kerr "," which you may know from the campaign Victoria's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Inside I juble, because it is much better for me personally to attract than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which increased in the last period of the hundred kilos has (oh well, that is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or look on the Internet, and then extend process graphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Moodboard," as the whole outcome is known, will come our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist attracts the model not only physically, but is also the so-called product page in the magazine (after specific target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">The Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday lecture was seasoned from three visitors from the industry:</seg>
<seg id="31">On Jan Stylisten Pokorný, Jakub Polanka by fashion designers and the fashion photo Graf Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us to exploit that fashion is illusion and that should be a Stylist capable of this.</seg>
<seg id="33">Stylist eingeschickter and able to work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.</seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word means variability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can take him but also on the naked body, attract (shoes and wear it as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is enough to roll up our sleeves or the collar and the whole look is quite different.</seg>
<seg id="37"> "It plays," he stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But the most important to me was the following advice: "First you need to know the rules of perfect."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Only then can you hurt them," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally will have to clear to me why we Pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if one in Modejournalen altogether different often gets to see.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of fashion look not to mention.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben knows I photographed now that a Stylist must have much more clothing variants prepared when he eventually.</seg>
<seg id="43">So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten attire) to be prepared to stylen at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With all this, we must therefore expect in shaping the attire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and sometimes Styl account for half of the success that Jan Pokorný confirmed to us.</seg>
<seg id="47">It looks like Madonna to view a not particularly brilliant singer, made in the image and marketing a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, one of the services of a Stylisten is more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="49">Well-known personalities are so often for wasted money (the main thing is that I am a little, as I look at) is secondary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if someone gives us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is likely to consume another (smaller) size when he or she needs in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">One needs only to then googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding Promi have again too or decreased, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Jan and Mario put us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and assemble them then the Outfit 'needs. "</seg>
<seg id="53">In his work he needs to communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">People appreciate without cosying up and stand on his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If orders us any manager to sift through their clothes cabinet and to complement beautiful pieces, then we can overcome them, not the entire cabinet and say, my God, this is terrible."</seg>
<seg id="56">"We must find at least a few good things on which it recommends that you can wear them," Mario says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He showed us quite specifically, which must include a so-called "seat pocket."</seg>
<seg id="58">So as a pocket one zuknöpft on the slim waists and in which it takes all necessary Proprietäten.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">No such clear things like scissors to remove the hair Abroller or safety needles also contains such Utensilien as a Nylonfaden (hence the Stylist helps the photography of products, such as handbags or IT IS NOT BE Bill), specific clips, bled with those behind the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other jam are forbidden, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that we can but not only to listen, but try something practically, we learned how shoes under-soaked right.</seg>
<seg id="61">The photography studio courses, where the floor is, one can damage the Schuhsohle, let alone the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Us o-soaked and we stuck...</seg>
<seg id="63">With the gap, it should not affect the shoes, so that we do not damaging them.</seg>
<seg id="64">So we must be really cleverly.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario enjoyed myself when he praised mean "creation" without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="66">The aforementioned skill is not my strength.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All this was just a fraction of what we used to listen in on the second weekend sex-continuation course.</seg>
<seg id="68">One thing has become clear to me now - to address the Styling at professional level is not an easy task.</seg>

<seg id="2">Review</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The original reckless journey through a series of could be avoided entirely, amateurish errors on routine journey on the morning shift.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was able to meet the ambitions in large part, but what use is that when clearly had no desire to do a bit more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part inspired with the subtitle "The run 'high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">But he promised that already old games series "need for speed" to postpone a bit into a new dimension and the spielbaren demonstration in play, he seemed to be just one of many Action-Rennspielen.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were curious to know how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But, as it is used with NFS already, in effect, is much different than it had expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade-race, but overall the game will be reduced by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of a largely incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Firstly, it will be introduced into the history, whose main character Jack has certain problems personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">In San Francisco, on the west coast, it is the wheel - with the task to be the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The entire route is divided into 10 stages and in more than 50 individual races.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that every race is being played on a different route, and that the various stages held in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is no time to offer the impression that game would always the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environment are still look very attractive, although the technical level of the chart does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore nothing earth-shattering news.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the journey through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high through deep snowy landscape we visually very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Occasionally atypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, for example, will be surprised by a desert storm, which limits the view.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains, in turn, you have to watch your step that we will not be buried by an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Incidentally, are quite well integrated in a row the individual races.</seg>
<seg id="25">Only a few, but they range.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a while it tries to the mandatory number of opponents to overtake () in principle, a classic race, one has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then an expected even a personal duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">And even the police is interfering, which wants to blow the whole thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">This is more about some interactive Animationen where Jack before anyone and where he flees the player must help by at the right moment, the right button lies.</seg>
<seg id="30">So nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that there is in the game, much less such passages, as one would expect (specifically) probably only three.</seg>
<seg id="32">Ultimately, this is the matter more to the benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it belongs in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game diversify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Fahrmodell moves in the Fußtapfen of the previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">In other words, seen by today's focus, it is no trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it would be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who looks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But an action invited the European Fahrmodell Rennfahren will remain very well, although we could find better in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until then, everything is so far wrong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems appear only after a certain period of time.</seg>
<seg id="39">Unlike the Fahrmodell the collision model is not quite OK</seg>
<seg id="40">In a game of this kind is not that complicated deformations such collisions and calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea how the car is behaving, not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Case in point: The close do or sail at oncoming cars scratches "one in some places the other car only slightly in others, but it is almost identical situation into a tailspin and wild performance centres.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or the chariot sails straight to scrap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the Restart-system this is nothing is annoying, it always is.</seg>
<seg id="44">The rest Arts are resolved as: If you total damage has or far away from the route ends up, then one raises the game back to the last indication of the route.</seg>
<seg id="45">Only in every race, one only has five rest Arts.</seg>
<seg id="46">If you have exhausted them, everything starting from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="47">The rest Arts is more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we should not leave it better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, but not even the Restart, there is nothing else helps to learn than the critical section from the head.</seg>
<seg id="49">Very uncomfortable that the same things happen often in the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some curves, one must drive, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise we simply by not fit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere it at the appropriate juncture "civilian" cars is always in the same configuration, regardless of whether you first or fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the counterparty easily ignored in one of two oncoming cars, but before it even gets there, the cars are already in such a position that it must be avoided or slow down.</seg>
<seg id="53">And it does not matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation ever close above your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have other benefits.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is always on the same spot by the same opponent obsolete and again without regard to the timing.</seg>
<seg id="56">The most crazy this at the end of the game is on the long bridge that happens in countries.</seg>
<seg id="57">The counterparty needs one here to overtake come hell or high water.</seg>
<seg id="58">And if he is in one, he takes one, of course, the view, so you drive the car initially there a couple of times in Klump.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Clearly, we want to make the game more exciting and exciting events simply but this intention is so clear that it spoils the joy of a fast game.</seg>
<seg id="60">And that is a pity, because despite the game is easier Fahrmodell action carrying a total of quite entertaining and in places so that we know almost no longer, which is one of the head.</seg>
<seg id="61">And what is, in principle, "guilty" because the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the races in a way - is that no boredom can pay, or something quite different...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is also the venture exchange during the races.</seg>
<seg id="63">No one should overlook the petrol stations along the route, because you can change the car, although the car is enough in most cases, which has just one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical operations, for example on the Serpentinen in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the mode of the game history is) the tasks-mode (challenges - the races in various localities, which we know from history.</seg>
<seg id="67">There are not just medals, but also experience points to win the own profile that) together for the tasks (challenges and is history.</seg>
<seg id="68">Started to be open-minded to get to the higher level of drivers to various objects: From the car to the Backgrounds the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is linked to the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own results achieved with those of other players and also for further collective functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the more incomprehensible slip-ups Doing is a situation in the last race of history.</seg>
<seg id="71">It comes with the car in a subway tunnel (as), where they raced in the dark on the track long (as).</seg>
<seg id="72">On the Tacho paragraphs look between 150 a 200 km / h) (nay, but there is suddenly from behind an underground and drives an uncompromising to scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorial, we will probably still argue whether this was a blackout in the game makers or whether the authors are so stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall picture is in most cases, rather bland and here and there, even brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="75">Even more worrying is that, in some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slower and it is sometimes quite dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="76">This is, however, notably the accidents with greater numbers of concern, where benefits a continuous FPS anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste thing.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a bid to such a broad as possible scale raise more young audience, was a Sound Track a lá "by everyone" something - but who is buying such a game for the music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall picture of the need for speed: The run? The feelings are mixed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game would not diminished by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to argue with the held the belief that The run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But as the game is somewhat immature.</seg>
<seg id="82">In for a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for a sting these mistakes with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU Ambassador Vicenová:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of whack."</seg>
<seg id="4">I would not have expected that such a hard war flares. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"It will be five to six years, until the dust will have settled and used all of their new role," girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite strongly began her speech at the law faculty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously it the motto "understandable and open about Europe takes," they already showed in the first part of her speech, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way that they envy some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Madam Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Initially, there was criticism that he was too concealed - a grey official, who was not up such a role, but I have to say that it has through all the breath of how well he has taken up the cause.</seg>
<seg id="9">"He is a person who brings it ready to listen patiently 27 member states to communicate with them and, in particular, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then as an answer to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? What number I can call?, "as an important step toward unification and better readability of EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants us our Ölmützer Quargel ban</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Madam Vicenová also focused its agenda, which lived under the European Union, lives and to live in the near future plans.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech Presidency of two years ago, they called a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and is also organising the summit for Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The fall of the government during the presidency they called a big negative, which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do all hands full.</seg>
<seg id="17">The ambassador said the words, it was not only the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis is not yet over, right to a state of panic.</seg>
<seg id="18">And the seven-year budget still needs to be approved by the EU, which makes precisely because of the current economic situation is much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whether it is a slim budget and thrifty, which receive priority sectors, which countries and which will be promoted more less - all that is now on the agenda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels, "understandable on Europe."</seg>
<seg id="21">"If I do not like something, then there are gräuliche acronym, concepts and jargon that no one understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">How should I know as citizens, whether it makes in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and bananas in different sizes or whether anyone actually wants to ban the Quargel.</seg>
<seg id="23">They would also like the soil of the EU used to get more Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe of two or different speeds in prospect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs are the reputation of being Eurosceptics, more negative than positive aspects of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="26">All the more galling the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because many factors are to blame to write including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivate letters and, not least, the weak support for the Czech side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, has been called the V4.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Believe me, if a pole or a Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak near, then the Frenchman beside me," He says what is her together the heads - that is already out of your V4? 'And it makes a pretty acid straight face.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Madam Vicenové, the EU expect in the future, especially tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.</seg>
<seg id="31">As much fairer, as a "European Federation" she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of encouraging cooperation."</seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time, it was said that the countries should only work who want it and those who do not want it to calm sidelines."</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong" multi-speed Europe ', "Mrs Vicenová expects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the entire EU by all member states must be and not only by the countries of the eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="2">The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">We wish to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most closely, then that would be the word "longevity."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern enterprise, although a century has passed since its inception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis for the longevity of its first chief, presented the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.</seg>
<seg id="6">Before he took the slogan, countless global problems could be easily resolved if people were willing to think a little bit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan: "Think!" Was the trademark at the life of the future giant should set (and at the same time, the title of the corporate internal magazine, which are already at IBM in 1935 issue began).</seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the basis of Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates, everything else around to change.</seg>
<seg id="11">This allowed us during our first century to transform the technologies, the business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company said on the occasion of the "anniversary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">-conceived system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson ran back in the 1930s social care of its employees, in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia, the IBM-people had as one of the first American workers paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a thoughtful pay system for best innovators and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sophisticated as the long-term relationship of IBM are with their customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM lifted any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with this anti-discrimination policy of the current plan, the Palmisan will alternate at the head of IBM next year by a woman is also - of Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is already 30 years at IBM, before they took the position of Vetriebs-, marketing and strategy head.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM makes in recent years, so-called online Brainstormings, which many future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, the company almost half a million people are employed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Their steadfast position in the Business guarantees the company a strong image and this after within and outside.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," The Economist said the professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company to solve business problems with the help of technology helps George Colony of consultation firm Forrester Research added."</seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself points out, there is a distinction to be on the market only present or to shape it with this presence directly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - named in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue" is grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM is developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product broad - from servers to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of the American technology companies IBM has the majority of patents and five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">Among his best-known inventions bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or the diskette include, for example.</seg>
<seg id="30">With approximately 220 billion dollars of stock market value (market capitalization IBM this year was the second-largest technology company (right after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The look ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - unhappy o / 2 were, for example, the attempt with its own operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC Jr.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not be emotional tie to the past," says that Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore, IBM has no problem to build his ground on various platforms - and if they do not work, them to leave again.</seg>
<seg id="35">Unlike the rival Microsoft, which is in principle with its Windows operating system and falls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technologies,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">In the profits of IBM services, software are participating in the greatest degree and hardware participate on each one-fifth.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 1990, hardware was still represent a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM sold little profit abwerfende assets worth $15 billion in the same time, however, it invested 58 billion dollars into the shopping promising technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these investment IBM continued even after 2008, when the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, which increased in the midst of the Great Depression its investment scale.</seg>
<seg id="42">So far, it appears that the company IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig at 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The company slogan of IBM is: Everything can change - not only the values.</seg>
<seg id="45">It is to be expected that this flexible giant resolves the next crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM-history: The cheese Schneider to outer space flights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The one hundred years ago in New York society founded IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM took it until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The foundation for later society IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on registration of the work begins and -endes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of this new company Charles Ranlett Flint, who holds the presidency until 1930, was on the board.</seg>
<seg id="52">And it was Flint, who stopped the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that it helped him in the running of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Leader was then even the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson headed the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, began, as the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - of sausage-and Käseschneidern to cash.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he has doubled its turnover at nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so essential for the company that he sat whole 40 years in the head, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson younger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, engineers and computer from IBM helped NASA flights to launch into space - for Merkur and Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, IBM developed in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System / 360.</seg>
<seg id="61">A classic PC that determined the computer-standard that time came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 on the market.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the consul aunts part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and a rose to fully into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy is paying off IBM in the last three years, Planet the concept of "smarter."</seg>
<seg id="64">It is the intention to use technology to clever way, not even in previously planned areas, for example to improve the situation in transport and in the cities of administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the platform "smarter Commerce," which is intended to help dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="67">Before 1932 IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - even as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, IBM is ČR including a strategic outsourcing centers in Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and a top team of researchers is also world-class that deals with the technology of Stimmerkennung.</seg>

<seg id="6">You must buy a conflict at least a week?</seg>
<seg id="7">Go to shop, and it must also be in action a bit more?</seg>
<seg id="8">It is in your case, probably really a weakness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Some women are aware of this and at least try to keep their shopping mood reasonably under control.</seg>
<seg id="10">But hand on heart, the woman from thinks it has to been dawdling in search of a good seated upper clothing only as a clothes shop and try not equally all (in all sorts of Farbkombinationen) in the booth?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Even if the shopping for most women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.</seg>

<seg id="17">They know that somehow?</seg>
<seg id="18">Yes?.</seg>
<seg id="19">Then you probably belong to the women who are downright obsessed, as they look.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">This does not mean long, that you should take, but many men have an allergic reaction out if their wife whinges constantly about their appearance.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">If you are under this kind of "Devianz 'suffering, you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life are not in the first place.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Development of the trip prices since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The agents then sold mainly only travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at the time were allowed only select group.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And as Czech tourists to the Baltic Sea) travelled (in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, into the Soviet Union Sochi (on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and use it to Hungary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">An internal exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then a proposed Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia have been severely restricted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A major paradox of the socialist times was that it (not even citizens of the Soviet bloc, including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen of ČSSR individually, for example, wanted to travel to Poland, or even in the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then, the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then they had to take huge queues in buying or sleeping bag before the travel agency sent, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.</seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, the matter was long gone.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people granted - the others could not travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovakia's currency was no free exchange face currency without foreign exchange commitment so it would be impossible to the necessary funding (Western currency) find for a trip to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The most Czechs weither therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless bought second homes and dachas, a habit that continues to this day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 were a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">An enormous paradox, of which it is aware today no longer is the fact that it was not the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia travel until 1989 at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the last century to the foreign exchange duty was lifted into the neighboring West European countries, eliciting a huge wave of short visit mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken could be had for a long time from their trips to the West simply not enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Czech holidaymakers sleeping on trips to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have already had the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature on foreign travel by Czech was a with canned beer and duration sausages etc vollgepackter boot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades of our tourists were able to buy the Western currency finally free.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and, hence, the average salary rose, which empties into another important moment in 1997.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel agents began after 1997 regularly prepare travel by charter flights, leaving the air travel through the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, incredibly makes it cheaper than in the past.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The end of the 1990s had the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already loose foreign currency transactions with all advanced countries of the world, which travel made even easier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-Velvet 'travel occurred in 2000, when the first direct charter flight was due to the high demand checking into an exotic country - after Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since then, annual direct charter-aircraft fly with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it directly from the Czech Republic 12 flies to exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another important moment in the era that characterized our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted visa requirements for Czech tourists, making our country is in the process offing modernisation is definitely among the advanced countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, the Czechs) for the first time spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3% and for the first time in their history they spent for a single holiday stay at the resort, including the cost of more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate looms.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known risks.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until now, there is still no agreement, which is to be elected under election rules.</seg>
<seg id="4">And without that, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June Hašek resigned from his post, and he asked his colleagues in the departure of them had to agree and to find a strong personality, which could lead the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only - in the era after Hašek the old squabbles between the two Association Chambers broke out again, which could not agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was clear on 16 September, when the new president should be chosen.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the General Assembly had come free of charge to people house in Prague quarter Smíchov, because the negotiations produced no result, and it was not only the election itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">You could not even agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection, only the statutory representatives or with a power-funded officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point it reached agreement, at least in part, including the recommendation of the institute also contributed to state and right, whose opinion was a representation at full power base is not allowed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The dispute over the election rules, however, continue to persist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Executive Committee did not provide more clarity on the matter, ordinary in its meetings, whether in principle is extraordinary - or anything else on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the views regarding the election changed a couple of times - the worst point remained the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: What should we do in the third round to avoid a stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The issue is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a different model must be found," noted Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR, who represents in the management of the professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to a registered model in the third round of the triumphs candidate who receives expressed as the greater support in the chamber, for which he is standing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the triumphs candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner in this prozentuellen vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"The two first heat, IFE AT ALL have no sense that this mode the whole bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side that it would be best not tweaking the election rules, but according to choose valid statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It is also surprisingly Tomáš Paclík, even if emerging that the statutory election rules by all candidates is probably best Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is my wish that is elected largely after the statute."</seg>
<seg id="23">"To be conceived in order for any nonsensical ersatz variants, as in the last general meeting the owner said," (the club) Victoria Plzeň, who is standing for the first time in his opinions and to neo-especially Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">But Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk, and he believes that the candidates will work together in the future in a constructive manner.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification for the national team would help the football-Euro today sure to calm the passions."</seg>
<seg id="27">"If the football is only on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," the official from Jablonec who by all three Adepten and this is the greatest experience at both professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."</seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts trying to fudge the rules for their own purposes". "</seg>
<seg id="31">"That is why a new deadlock in the general meeting is not excluded."</seg>
<seg id="32">"However, I hope that common sense prevails," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides is not.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be complete until the qualification game at all.</seg>
<seg id="35">The charter plane Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice should fly, among other things, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction even as it sought urgently for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee, but still at the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level is then crucial, on which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education had the divided parties within the biggest sports associations of the country like to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">There is a lot at stake: State handouts, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will lead the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík goes in the fight for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers could account for the extraordinary general meeting would be a strong candidate, who met) all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of Czech Republic (FAČR, he would not have allowed at all in the fight for the lead.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there was a good candidate, then I would fight for him and renounce the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation, it failed to find such a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, is to prevent so that the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta reached to the top of the FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stresses that he does if he wins the role of chairman to put only one year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to hear a seen top manager who is not involved in the football too much.</seg>
<seg id="46">"With some eligible people I have spoken personally."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Only to believe that some people have told me that they were not currently with the Czech football identify.</seg>
<seg id="48"> "Such views would have liked to change," he quoted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Most of all, supposedly the link Pelta bothers to influence Paclík 's Pilsner district with the chairman of the Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which goes behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of chairman.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"In his victory today's condition would einkonserviert and the Czech football progress were not at all."</seg>
<seg id="52">"The support by Berbr, a cleverem businessman, would get the football twice badly," Paclík stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Here he plays out that Pelta's name recently fell in connection with phone taps to identify in a corruption affair, however, Pelta emerged with impunity.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what should bring a victory of prestige Pelta which (tsch) football."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," řekl Paclík, who sees his former saying, 'he would sell the acquired London's Pilsner if Pelta will chair, "but rather more calmly said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Paclík should prevail in the Thursday election that he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="57">As another candidate thinks - Rajchl, the Paclík had supported before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I go."</seg>
<seg id="59">"He has great skills."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I putting my nose but not in matters which I understand nothing," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September for that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, Dagmar Damková replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík even claimed that he felt up to the role of the association chairmen.</seg>
<seg id="64">And holding up his skills in the direction of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the power to something in the football environment and to change to a degree of cultivation of this."</seg>
<seg id="66">"In order to curb the influence of certain interest groups that tend to disciplinary and appeal commissions to influence what deteriorates until sickening situations," Paclík led, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example to the Sparta-chief Daniel Křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of its priorities, he would see the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic-Committee, through which it flows would lobbyieren among political leaders for more money from the lottery tax in the sport.</seg>
<seg id="68">"That is one of the key things that should address the new chairman."</seg>
<seg id="69">"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, declare as the political parties, I understand their argument, they must also say clearly where the money is," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">His link to the Pilsner Paclík club is not a handicap, although he stresses itself, the chairman of the FAČR "bipartisan" be.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"It is my opinion but not much sense to transfer my shares in the club Pilsner hypocritical for a third person to to return to one and a half years," Paclík made clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, to rule out a stalemate situation in the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the Vorsitzendenamt: Miroslav Pelta, he will make his choice in the event that the FAČR gets new place statutes that exclude in future disputes over the election rules from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec is before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September, he wants to concentrate on his election to the national team and the collection of funds.</seg>
<seg id="78">He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting and to defend his ideas about the running of football and present in a broader context was help him the two-month break.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."</seg>
<seg id="80">"He feels that it is high time that the association is headed by someone, the man who is associated mainly with the Jablonecer club, which acted but also many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee says.</seg>
<seg id="81">That is also why he believes that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that the current problems with the election is responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, as it had adopted all were approved at the shareholders' meeting in June statutes that were not so perfect.</seg>
<seg id="84">If they would not have allowed different interpretations we had, from September already had a chairman, "Pelta said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">The revision of the main document of the citizens association he used as a lure for the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"If I become president, I suppose me personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="87">"This is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be" Pelta claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition, he does not try to differentiate themselves against his opponents.</seg>
<seg id="89">Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl he recognises because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He also attacked Tomáš Paclík no longer, which in turn left no dry thread of Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">In football, he moves for over a year and can point to some successes. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks were unworthy and many people were shocked by his electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"So many people have doubts about his true character," Pelta have addressed his opponent, which probably remain faithful to his proclamation, which he said in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="95">And they should be the hallmark of Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"I would also to try to end all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the echoes of the corruption scandal last year."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Shortly afterwards I would throw myself to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At the time, he also promised that his arrival will mean to the head of the Czech football no human cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I would like to make once familiar with the work of content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov where nervousness exists because of the long anarchy moved.</seg>

<seg id="100">Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk are not in vain.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If really should be the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come across it."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility and who wins it only when he finally has a new Leader Pelta remains two days" before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the general meeting on Thursday, the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, so many people would supposedly feeding frenzy in the Association's whim.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that, if elected, will start to work hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.</seg>
<seg id="107">He also promised to solve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="109">Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, down to the performance of the youth football. "</seg>
<seg id="110">"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone, 'said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and would therefore distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."</seg>
<seg id="112">And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football is moving forward in every segment with miles steps. "</seg>
<seg id="113">Many would delight not precisely because they would have to, rather than just the work of others, now really begin to work hard, "he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the tense atmosphere in the football movement to stand no longer have contemplated.</seg>
<seg id="115">"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who throw me not constantly thwarted and ask any step that I am in question," he said as an explanation of why he had hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others."</seg>
<seg id="118">"This is confidence that we must not waste," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">Allegedly motivates him to continue to welcome the work he has started in Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I simply do not want to throw away now."</seg>
<seg id="121">"It started in processes that are probably only in a few years, and I would be reluctant to see that they are stopp someone," he said, and hereby expresses his concerns that could be the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected to return the situation to the times in Hašek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that is not Mirek Pelta."</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him, people who make football so are especially were that he would be there only for exclusivity."</seg>
<seg id="124">I can reproach probably some things, but not that I would be biased. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"I am trying to be objective."</seg>
<seg id="126">"I like football for everyone, because it is all well and not just the selected" Rajchl said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">He also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to consider whether it should split the league into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners will then each in the first league."</seg>
<seg id="130">"It might not happen that today only three Moravian clubs playing in the league, which is especially for the young players in Moravia a problem," says Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because the head of Pilsner has now joined the club Tomáš Paclík struggle for the role of chairman, Rajchl do not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which has been elected to its vice-chairman and now that clear successes are behind me recognizes" Rajchl, which sees the saving of tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts that agreement of TV contracts and negotiations with the lottery law as his success led.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, it is partly the fault that the association does not in a single direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While he of Pelta says, "he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate who have something to offer the football.</seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can question that he has done in Pilsen in just a year's excellent work."</seg>
<seg id="136">"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the staff in the commissions would not change he apparently fundamentally."</seg>
<seg id="137">He would not want things certainly hinbiegen in his favor, "Rajchl judges on his rivals.</seg>

<seg id="5">A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder went over the past one and a half years on a research trip, her bathing suit was not allowed to miss one in their luggage:.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rücklings prone on the water, they looked into high art fully-developed domes, they sponge marble-Putten, who waited in the basin edge on them, and was on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.</seg>
<seg id="8">She liked a bath, they took it in great haste note in their book values - and know details about the construction and history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 swimming pools are being architecture historian Meder in this way - and bathing pleasures ": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest," hardcore concrete buildings, it is now in her recently published book "in the Taunus region near Frankfurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">They led by 13 countries of their "trip to the most remarkable bathrooms in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and at a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture-Enthusiastin.</seg>
<seg id="12">With sport, they do not have much on hat, Meder said - only in water that is different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell must resign, while Jogger breathe the smell of deceptive Fichtenwäldern or can listen merry Vogelgezwitscher in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have asked me one day, why swimming pools are always so ugly," says the Meder live in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So I started to collect fine baths."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Architecture rising water levels doubles</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Geplätscher jump in the pool and sauna-essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the senses are served, Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders have had trouble Schwimmhallen can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a foot soil has a rising water levels in bathrooms."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="20">Everything blend doubles: High vault, colorful Kacheln, leap out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The band kleinformatige picture "bathing pleasures" gives at 190 sides know value on the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness-havens - but especially appetite for a leap in the blues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remarkable specimens discovered the pooling Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside magnificent spas like the 100-year-old Széchenyi-bad in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Toruń, whose basin are filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a bottle shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Spectacular prospects, however, offer many firing Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zurich Dachbad has the whole city in the eye can look you in the outdoor pool of Bads in St Anton on schneebedeckten Arlberg - and, in Dampfbad there is a window from which they can monitor the activity on the skiing-runway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary pooling design from expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.</seg>
<seg id="26">For three open parings dampft sticking it in winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals into the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The Black Forest Alhambra</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Not in any swimming pool of the pool-Sammlerin Meder rose the smell of chlorine in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many for Toruń smell of sulphur in Árpád-bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong for fuel oil, which is believed to have landed in a bad health.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen salvation water that is almost black and its silt is one-soaked to the skin, once you are sliding themselves into the pool - a wellness-experience of the particular kind.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In one place Iris Meder was disappointed in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however: When they wanted to visit the Frei- and sun in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a abgesperrtes terrain.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 1902-designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic bath was now closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">When Meder verwitterten looked through the windows of the red-white-yellow youth style-building, they saw weeds between the tiles has grown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">One, on the other hand, has countered the decline in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palais thermal bath in Wildbad.</seg>
<seg id="35">Three construction schedules this bath has already behind them; you can discover not only neoromanische elements that come from days of its establishment in the year 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added at 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since the thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palais is the favourite thermal bath of pooling knowledge Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is quite an achievement to merge so different Baustile at such a great unity," Meder said.</seg>
<seg id="38">In such a palace in the Tauchgang Thermalpool seems only a sideshow.</seg>

<seg id="5">According to Spiegel-Online-information Josef Ackermann has asked a working group, the consequences of speculation to examine the world's poor.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the company chief will then draw consequences.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg, -</seg>
<seg id="8">For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study that banks are speculating with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of the Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report that the Food Watch presented in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the author Harald shows Schumann that betting on the global commodity exchanges are driving the prices - and therefore the banks take a complicity in the global hunger problem.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of entrusted directed specifically against Deutsche-Bank-chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are similar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally hedging against price fluctuations were thought commodity traders bet.</seg>
<seg id="15">But now, most experts are have agreed that the gamblers decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism that he promised to look into the allegations and said that no deal was "worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information obtained by Spiegel Online, an International Working Group is examining the allegations from the Food Watch-Report.</seg>
<seg id="18">Until the end of the year, the review will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, how to deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January to tell the head of the bank, then, what consequences it entails.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the end of a reduction of the commodity business could be, or even the complete departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann forge his image</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Foodwatch-head Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically as reckless banks today are damaging the common good."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.</seg>
<seg id="24">"Deutsche Bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on prices," said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Regardless of whether it is Mr Ackermann for people suffering hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The realization of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear that the company chief a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head will not change differently than planned in the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a departure from the controversial agricultural-speculation he could clean up his image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And about potential losses he needs to care little by little, his successor would have finally to do.</seg>

<seg id="33">On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which the institute Forsa interviewed on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just 11 percent think, therefore, it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank is offering facilities involving bets on prices for food.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The pavilion moving</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion gained from Brussels 1958 prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and down-ate-heeled.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now he will be reopened as exhibition house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When dreams of modern postwar architecture of clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Expo is a good and well-known example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzers pavilion at the time, received the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and float along-steel-glass-design.</seg>
<seg id="8">The construction is until today as a milestone contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He made the architect known as that of the next World Expo pavilion built of Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was famous in 1973 finally internationally.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its construction as a temporary exhibition planned pavilion was established after the World Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station, opened in 1962 and converted to a museum of the 20th century - the '20s House "was mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="12">Likely was the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls for the hanging of art, not a good climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, it has been used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will be used in future as a museum of contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Belvedere museum opens Tuesday evening, on which the House, where the first exhibition - a fluke in every respect.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Enforced the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco, which was 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, PhDs art historian with considerable career including the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, got the refitting strongly among politicians and Denkmalschützern, they obtain public funds and private sponsorship money and established the use.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except against the works of art were sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a book shop should be, and an office building had to be built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the implementation then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because he had converted Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive and expanded and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him "tremendously important place" was that he had seen "almost every weekend" exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The current reconstruction there were far greater problems: The building was "a Energieschleuder" Krischanitz says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The window profiles of the glass facade were changed, used glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Chill bridges-steel carriers are reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two bullets were in place for the new use, a abgesenkter light gap between home and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer-pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original outside doors remained, the House is removed in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-colour.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema hall is even more exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the building remained flexible and easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said that a typical "rates-in-the-City history."</seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a proper awareness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the 21er House has not happened but in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: The Swiss garden just around this completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier arises," with office and residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke will occur perhaps: The 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and we hear that it is negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.</seg>

<seg id="3">Since March, he has bought shares worth more than 10 billion dollars.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett did not always said to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the firms will predict only bad.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, however, he read the business reports from IBM and changed his mind about investment in the industry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He had earlier understand that IBM will mainly services and computer systems for the IT procure-departments of other companies.</seg>
<seg id="7">An investment by Warren Buffett is regarded as Knight blow in the financial world.</seg>
<seg id="8">Consequently, the IT cornerstone IBM must now call themselves "Sir IBM."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Because Buffett revealed now in the US business channel CNBC that he bought since March, IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars.</seg>
<seg id="10">His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has risen to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Buffett said that IBM had so far not even know something of the commitment.</seg>
<seg id="12">He praised the management, which had seen even in the economic crisis for ordinary profits.</seg>
<seg id="13">"They have done an excellent job," said Buffett's strategy.</seg>
<seg id="14">IBM has for some time on the lucrative IT Services as the operation of computing facilities.</seg>
<seg id="15">Of the more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting firms and powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="16">Buffett had shunned technology firms to date.</seg>
<seg id="17">He says he invest only in companies whose business he also understand.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead, Buffett around in a freight rail joined in, with a lubricant-manufacturers or machinery farmers.</seg>
<seg id="19">In addition to his holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly 80 subsidiaries also own shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola or the Munich re, the former Munich Rück.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The 81-year-olds had taken in the 1960s, the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and expanded it with wise investment into one of the most valuable companies in the world.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, his lifestyle is modest.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is therefore for countless investors around the world, a cult figure.</seg>
<seg id="23">His almost unmistakable sense for making money has won him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">After confirmation of the Buffett-Investments, the IBM-share vorbörslich rose by one percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Big Blue," as IBM also is known, is in the stock market as a whole more than 220 billion dollars worth and, therefore, together with Apple and Microsoft on the most valuable technology company in the world.</seg>
<seg id="26">At Microsoft, Buffett said he wanted but not enter.</seg>
<seg id="27">The founder Bill Gates was a close friend.</seg>

<seg id="1">The threat is palpable</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media question the German law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which auflebe now.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The murders of eight Turkish and Greek businessmen in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.</seg>
<seg id="5">This news will react in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because for many German-Türken sweeps a long totgeglaubtes specter: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That there is in Germany xenophobia, however, was never in question.</seg>
<seg id="8">The right-wing extremist network revealed to be uncovered but proportions, whose dimension is still far from clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The bloody ideology lives back on?" The headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk. "</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities may be involved in the extreme right-wing swamp.</seg>
<seg id="11">Germany's Turkish community reacted calmly: They reminded at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.</seg>
<seg id="13">In lively colors coexistence was orchestrated - as a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">As a slap in the face is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the 50th" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," speaking behind the murder series.</seg>
<seg id="15">The German edition of 'Hürriyet' will not take it to consider these ideas link.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It starts to smell," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stresses that people have been murdered, paying the taxes and would have done with their work, an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">The approach is very critical in German-Turkish Internet forums discussing the police and their later investigative success.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why it was thought the German authorities do not much more to look in right-wing extremists after suspects, the authors wonder.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some ready shows at least rhetorically drastic steps: "Mainly here will continue, the migrants have no other choice than the defense and the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="21">"That will probably be the best self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="22">"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strong domestic peace in Germany is," writes "selenium."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means when domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen shows up in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance in right-wing violence can result.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks, however, that sharpened We-feeling on the Turkish side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not repeat the mistakes of the past,</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press to visit the survivors of Mölln was challenged at the time, especially the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a message of condolences to the Turkish president, was represented at the funeral service in Cologne but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel listed in his speech, how many charges made the local Turks.</seg>
<seg id="30">So, when the value of a man charged after the level of its tax levies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks into the domestic law has since then.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scandal by Zürisee bank</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The bizarre bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS was in the financial crisis almost broke, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it is to send a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It had not Axel Weber certainly thought.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he stand 2013 almost as spectacular new job: Management Council President of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber looked forward publicly praised Switzerland because of its beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and was not friendly comments about the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A dealer of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and Been gambling found around 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS's board chief Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted banker, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The administration of President of the Council since UBS is also a sickly - and all ask: When will finally Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It was already known that Weber must advise the bank by February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And he takes over the administration Council seat in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber that will be hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is not a banker, economics professor and central bankers and would have an apprenticeship period had certainly needs.</seg>
<seg id="18">At a stroke, he will take over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just demonstrated once again that they have long deserved the title of "biggest scandal bank of Europe."</seg>
<seg id="19">Because the UBS is huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is spared.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss Vermögensverwalters had combined it with ambitious targets: They wanted to be in the investment banking, a very large number.</seg>
<seg id="24">The UBS managed $1.6 trillion in 2007, with high-net-worth clients more money than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand, it was advanced as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker and later longstanding banking professor in Zurich Hans Audit tells: "My students, I have portrayed the UBS at the time as a model of good bank."</seg>
<seg id="28">"From today's point of view, one wonders: How I could only be wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, was apparently the first time that something went wrong in the UBS properly.</seg>
<seg id="31">The middle of the year came head Peter Wuffli surprisingly, which by then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, you guessed why he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment division of the bank had been gambling found themselves with subprime securities and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to shoulder, the UBS announced a capital increase amounting to say and write 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">They found real investors, however, on which many had bodied until shortly before the nose: A intransparenten Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was gloss over the fact that it was not even his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, it was worse.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce new billions of losses, management Council President Marcel Ospel, 2006, still the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, the disaster: The UBS was given their investments in the financial crisis before the collapse, and had to be rescued by the state followed.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank has bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled assets, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole country was shocked - because they observed how dramatically it is for a small country, when it plays host to such large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banks researchers audit says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster, the second joined.</seg>
<seg id="45">Just a few months after the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to issue the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from this business with Strafaufschlag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The UBS openly confessed more or less to have helped in the tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time, it lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The aura of secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was followed by the resignation of head and management Council President.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of clients' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The bank had lost its credibility within a few months in two key portfolios: By the false speculation in investment banking and asset management through the help of tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just as it was once a somewhat more, just as we believed that the UBS will get it again, since these unfortunate traders follows-history: An individual trader Been gambling found 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something is going wrong.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it will obviously: With the risk management in the investment banking it works out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case of Adoboli you have to conclude that the risk control has changed too little," Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich bank Institute says.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial management of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was just the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time to be the guardian of the great assets of the world: Not too many risks to ensure security for money - was also collapse across the Alpine republic of the world.</seg>
<seg id="58">The vaults of Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The headquarters of UBS in Zurich nor fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road leading from the main railway station from directly to the Zürichsee, which is flanked by the schneebedeckten summits of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are luxurious, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">Juweliere like Tiffany's is here between Swiss tradition shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries, the Swiss banks stay here: From the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks like Julius bear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The reception hall of the UBS one enters through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside are marble disguised the walls, thick leather chair, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "Safe."</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer is here: Security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of Swiss Bank have ousted two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name, he would rather not read in the newspaper, finally, he is, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big business.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS had become far too big, he finds, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss would have nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if they have adapted long the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that the UBS changed, it cost only high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has in the subprime jungle so much money lost as the Swiss large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.</seg>
<seg id="75">"On that Wednesday's ruling coalition of the small country of seven million, the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash."</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros approved the politicians to save the big one standing before the bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did it happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">Talks with Swiss bankers, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks arrayed on a huge corporation.</seg>
<seg id="80">There was a bank that was too big for the merger for the small Swiss - and increasingly grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">Yet the two different precursor to complement-banks of UBS helped: A rich, but slept through bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the globalised investment bankers were favourable to a lot of money with which they could be a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of UBS, Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, company chief of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team," says banks researchers Hans audit.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, high intellectuals, modest, who knows a great deal of models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut person who has worked up the bank lesson by high."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel have relied on the closure on Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli have probably made at the end of a crucial mistake: "He thought his models are the reality," says auditions.</seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">Was an excess is clear: In the case.</seg>
<seg id="91">Staff of the UBS point clearly to the offending executives-meetings at which company chief Wuffli was always the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">They led the league tables, the rankings, which documented the success of the banks that time.</seg>
<seg id="94">Then, the UBS wanted, the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps were already have kept her.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the foreign exchange business and the securities they played with the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate advisers who have been charged, however, stressed a weakness: International interest in the business, in which bankers language "surprise fixed income there is" a huge gap with the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">In order to close this gap, UBS into an adventure that they cost almost the existence went.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a before her established hedge funds invested in U.S. subprime assets.</seg>
<seg id="101">So it became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage lending packaged and far reaching, but also even risks prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="102">Still, when other banks long sought the exit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS, has bought there," banking expert audit says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">As the euphoria of large, so deep.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager had to go after another, as the trials tested clean up more difficult than had been thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Post in the UBS became the Schleudersitz and are still shaky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Anyone who leads the major bank now has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank, who have lost all obvious business models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banks researchers audit already has an idea: Stop the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">So far, the bank will (still) not go.</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti intends to present to the world its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution, when the bank itself surprisingly of predecessor Grübel separated.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, he has prevailed: He should permanently lead the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank to the state in the mid-1990s trim.</seg>
<seg id="116">He cut 3,500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">That will not be enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">What it wants to make money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that arise Axel Weber safe now.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly he says only that he will seek with his wife, once an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="1">Mass slaughter on a personal level</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Einfühlsam and generous Peter Englunds begins new book "beauty and horror, a history of the First World War, told in nineteen beings" with a long list of players who is one to heart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Here is a piece of advice, as it could be: Do you this side cautiously and you make them on your read sign.</seg>
<seg id="4">You will get to know these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well, and these players will have as your GPS function, deprived of a beacon in those few moments where you lost as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and your illusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has written an unusual book, which he describes not incorrect as "a work of the anti-history."</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, reckless reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less men and women on both sides of the war along inconspicuous, of schoolgirls and Botanikern up to mountaineers, doctors, hospital car drivers and clerks.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people are heroes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some are crazy about prisoners of war, loss of limb, or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these lives to have flared up like the Votivkerzen in a church, some added to lapse over others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Book Englunds deviates from the usual history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war position on the West Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Beauty and horror" relocating with experts view on other war show venues: The Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book bees baskets, one celebrates Christmas fall under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is almost from the start, a very moving book.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smell, after Kordit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and hear cannons fire in the distance. Stand or take the flight?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who comes at all?</seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being waged at all.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Lack of facts," Englund notes, "were aufgemöbelt with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories were taken mainly memories, letters and other previously published material.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their life stories can be frighteningly or simple, but they are very alive in the Englunds in details possessed accumulations of small moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them act of shortages and oneself recourse.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the history of a German Schulmädchens he tells: 'Replacement, everywhere substitute. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"Substitute coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper associations, wooden buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He tells more of the substitute Essen in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">He describes "meat, which was made from large compressed piece of rice and cooked in Hammelfett (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes that were besohlt with wood was."</seg>
<seg id="32">There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitute funds that were permitted in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute resources."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories act of honor and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "We feel that this is in spite of what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, pretending that means such a facade of civilisation and when there were no barbarism behind their own strengthened and team of sophisticated shirt breast."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he probably die and no one of them will take notice or care about.</seg>
<seg id="36">"If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves growing gap one would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is so terrible as "a convicted man, who was hanged in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations act of the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The dispute was increasingly becoming an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">He catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in Bestiarium of the young century": "The eloquent and ideologically committed slaughtered mass murderer in the yardstick that, while he sits behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivoles behavior as heroic acts.</seg>
<seg id="42">Englund discusses the soldiers who tried actively being infected with a prostitute with a venereal disease to escape the front service.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The grotesque manifestation of this can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals to come in the hope, to the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Those who were really desperate, rub it in the eye, which meant that they were the rest of their lives blind."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">This translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek and yet intrusiveness and adapts perfectly suited to his human task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war unleashed "unique way uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">The people are starting to wonder why their leaders bring them the fighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War were predominantly falsified as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Gallery memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Englunds band enters an unconventional glory hall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has the most devastating end, of which I have ever read in a Sachbuch.</seg>
<seg id="51">I admit it no longer.</seg>
<seg id="52">But it is as he would have us with his book this side with the players before the nose weggeschnappt and with a match set.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">After an early misstep by a meticulously planned assault</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police officers were involved in some of them wore used helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">We had opted for the night of Monday to Tuesday, because few people in Zucotti Park are at this time.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed to participate in an exercise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Police President Raymond W. Kelly was in the middle of them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.</seg>
<seg id="6">The events of the past few weeks as the onset has been blinded against protesters, which is against the rules of the Dezernats and Hausbesetzern gave a huge increase in public sympathy, were not allowed to repeat itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And so the police for the removal of the protesters was carried out from the's Zuccotti Park after two weeks of planning and training.</seg>
<seg id="8">Officials had prepared them when they saw how occupations were handled in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="9">A Katastrophenübung had taken place with a glance at's Zuccotti on Randalls Island.</seg>
<seg id="10">Officials reinforced the so-called chaos-training, counter-terrorism measures, including the speedy displacing a large number of police officers - to focus on lower Manhattan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The last training unit was held Monday night at the Manhattan-side of the East River.</seg>
<seg id="12">The order to enter the park, came "at the last minute said," someone who is familiar with the order, which spoke for a declaration as "exercise."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"The few police officers who were involved, to my knowledge, did not know that it was the's Zuccotti Park," someone who wishes to remain anonymous, said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The only ones who knew that it went the's Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the portfolio."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.</seg>
<seg id="16">On 14 October officials wanted to clear the park, but were being transformed into back then, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including use of commandos from around the city, hundreds of mobile officials, which are typically used in high-crime neighborhoods.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Mr Kelly said that during the day and many people work in the park, almost like commuters, 1 p.m. on the night is a good time to get into.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was appropriate to do so if the smallest number of people residing in the park," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ambulances with Jupiterlampen and, according to spokesmen were ready before the departure of the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="21">The lamps and the pre-recorded messages that roared from the loud speakers, many protesters appeared to intimidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">When the public officials broke into their bright blue Windjacken into the park, many protesters together simply roused their belongings and left the scene.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The police said that until 1: 45 p.m. no tents would be handled in order to give the protesters time to get their possessions together.</seg>
<seg id="24">Other teams of officials were seen as they gathered in the vicinity to intervene, arrests in the park should be necessary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Reporters were forced to leave the park.</seg>
<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police chief, said that this was done to their own security.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists say that they wanted to prevent them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the use of the officials was very violent.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr Browne said that television venture in the Church Street would be able to draw on the west side of the park photos.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As the police in west through the mess in personal terms of the protesters, including suitcases, plastic lawn and bags with clothes, turbulent, her city employees cleaning, which was removed, was left behind what followed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">To go some protesters who refused were towed out. Pictures of even a short time later appeared on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="31">A main core of protesters was near the kitchen area of the camp in the centre of the park position.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">About 10 people at the epicenter of the camp tied together in their arms.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two people chain themselves to trees, Mr Kelly said.</seg>
<seg id="35">The civil protection officials were launched, loszuschneiden them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">As Mr Kelly said, 3: 30 p.m. until around no arrests were carried out in the park.</seg>
<seg id="37">The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">Most of the arrests occurred, as he said, for "disorderly conduct and resisting arrest."</seg>
<seg id="40">The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of department, the highest uniformed officers of the department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, head of the Kriminalbeamten, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">Despite its presence "headed" Mr Kelly "Operation ', as Mr Browne said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">In the event that they should have access to a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.</seg>
<seg id="45">It could be seen as the police stretch from these sites from the radius further the's Zuccotti Park around.</seg>
<seg id="46">In a place as several officials, many of them spent with protection signs, people outside has been observed.</seg>
<seg id="47">Some 28 people were in the northern radius.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.</seg>
<seg id="49">At 5 p.m. south of the Pine Street jumped a protest on the roof of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air in the tyre of a police bus.</seg>
<seg id="50">In one place the crowd threw a piece of Sperrholz.</seg>

<seg id="1">Trade union of carers will file a complaint against the city because layoffs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern who have lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, unnecessary and discriminatory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The complaint is probably the last chance that the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make the redundancies, still open.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer, care coordinators and other assistants who had lost to the lowest paid employees of the city and were on 7 October in a move their work, described the union leader as political revenge for that one had refused last year, the city of access to a health fund, which the groups maintained, with which the budget gap should be closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This accusation categorically rejected by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the City Council Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, said last month that the dismissals were part of the budget that we have adopted in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the council, who shot back and told him that nothing spezifiziere in the budget that staff would be the Schulhilfe dismissed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials of the council 37 said that they had and the Ministry of Education warned of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The complaint will cite Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and count eight redundant workers as a plaintiff, which are all color or Latin American women, as have most of the workers who lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the city would not be the case, and thus their individual claims could not be commented on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft complaint before the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighborhoods of the city to support a complaint for discrimination, claiming that poor schools would have lost more workers because they are chronically underfunded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It points out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few redundancies in the school's Upper East Side or the TriBeCa, 17 Schulhelfer in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and have lost 46 helpers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were sacked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern who were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood parents irrelevant to organise the donations to offset budget cuts."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.S.: The budget of the 36th District has been cut this year by 3,26 percent, lost money when the city for their calculation method, the extra funding for any poor school enrolment changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The union also complains that the heads of the high schools start were guided by the language in a memo, which authorized the release of care coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German: Hand describes) in the United States, usually the switch of a teacher of the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central office.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate approved a resolution, which is under Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya, which started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="7">The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libyan debate.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, the lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution, which authorized the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day that law by fell in the Senate, the House voted on a decision to cut the funding for American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the US mission into a kind of legislative purgatory got - with a Congress that it was aware enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to shoot him definitively the ground under the feet.</seg>

<seg id="13">Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.</seg>

<seg id="1">Troops feel rather than respect sympathy</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The event was a Wall Street-gala, collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Kid Rock sang a Ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.</seg>
<seg id="4">On cue, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and naval gathered around him.</seg>
<seg id="5">The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring, said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">A senior military officer at the gala, which was watched by, among others, former chairman and chief of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers said it well.</seg>
<seg id="10">I know that.</seg>
<seg id="11">But there was no respect, really. It was a pity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admiring American public.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the praise has its price, say service members.</seg>
<seg id="15">The public is increasingly acting as if it would do the people in uniform suffering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We were not victims," said Brigade along Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will go soon after.</seg>
<seg id="17">"But apparently the only way is the support he is made to fit into the role of unfortunate souls."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in the dispute with the public, which they serve.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have also acknowledged that the anger that proposed returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War against was far worse.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a result, there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.</seg>
<seg id="21">After his two sons have returned from fighting with marines, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see its service from two different perspectives.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Some would view them with a sense of awe, as they were defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.</seg>
<seg id="23">Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and on his return has a senior government posts in Washington over said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">During his search, he said, he sensed that some of the subtle Theys obtains interviewer whether he is able to withstand immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"When you talk about your service, you need to keep the negative impressions about it," Cancian said his sons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.</seg>
<seg id="27">Services on the battlefield are picked out of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely as praise.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">The military is the growing pressure to crack down on rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 men and women for intervention are not charged in a rape before the military court.</seg>
<seg id="3">It does not happen, hundreds of prosecutor are ready for the next hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Me Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was in October 2008, and they returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when they met on a male colleague, who wore a 12er Pack beer.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked them whether he will accompany them for a drink in her room.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My alarm bells went to," said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: 'No, he is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is from Texas, "she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I would have listened to my gut feeling."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer, the man was behind it, they put down and they raped, it claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, decided on 18 November, waiting Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, whether a lawsuit they have filed against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose in the following months to 28: 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were being raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify it, to condemn or to put a proper jurisdiction after the alleged attack available.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says she follow the top military leadership, because the problem will start there.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is built hierarchical," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke says also be that it has contacted since February nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs of their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many other complaints so that the pressure to maintain.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defence for the Defense Ministry, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="22">The files of the court, the Newsweek, to lead the defense in depth, primarily that the military cannot be accused of current or former soldiers for violations that have occurred in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because of a law by the Supreme Court from the 1950, known as the Feres Doctrine, the government will not be liable for injuries, inflicted on active duty troops.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged damage during the course of the plaintiffs," states the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">If women are still not allowed to service in the fight, the distinction only on behalf of lies: Modern wars have seldom clear fronts.</seg>
<seg id="28">In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: Between these two wars 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them died in the fighting.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the military will be modernised, Burke says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And she is not alone in their struggle: Except its three other lawsuits are pending.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, the veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies, because of alleged promotion of women hostile atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">Regardless of the non-governmental Vietnam Veterans of America, collects a complaint against the military in which one focused on the diagnosis "personality disorder" that rape victims were given to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">In December, the group submitted a complaint against the Veterans Administration (dt.: Management of war veterans a), in which she did her discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws was produced independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.</seg>
<seg id="36">2010 were under the Sexual assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses.</seg>
<seg id="37">But most abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account this number around 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, which was published in March, is also examining the prosecution rates: 2010 came 20 percent of reported cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the Lymans case she reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="41">On this night, she says she was asked 11 times, recounting the details of her rape of a large number of policemen, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She had a rape SET and the blood of her aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during this hearing, she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people from said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought that would use the labour pains. I ran screaming from the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="47">"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that I said when I came out again to my commander: This was not his procedure, and that was my procedure."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who admonished ultimately a personality disorder and they declared incapable of service.</seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, she was discharged honorably, so that they receive no support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other plaintiffs have tabled proceeds, is pure speculation, John Turley, a professor of law from says to the George Washington University Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nonetheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first put in question.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am time life a critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military lags behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings a liability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: "The odds are against them... but it is important for them that they try it."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change to fight if good people are ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs will start for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Or until we die, which is always the first.</seg>

<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before he became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, was just one of many boys who had their anti-immigration views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to have committed a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing in court.</seg>
<seg id="4">Despite Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time until his attack on his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on the part of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as you find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">This is easy - one need only www.securityjam.org on Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have found that it was not hard to reach them Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory Demos says," on the digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Facebooks hiding of personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett that the researchers must use the Werbetool page says simply to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly as retail for years to do it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and reshape them with Adds, but instead to connect with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a poll in which after their education, their attitude toward violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">You Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation, more than 10,000 supporters were to question of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they would have to leave once their office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But in a kind of surprising distortion "are those who remain their online activism combine with an off-activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health and social trends, such as in "Likes" text messages and status updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users who add three content on average per day, generating Facebooks "data Super Nova" has a research boom that increase the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title in the last five years by nearly 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some researchers for the beauty of Facebook is the fact that we can study this side of people who are not normally reaches with his Clipboard on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If you tried earlier to interview people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"They had to inform the party and which would have never given access," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"On Facebook that everything falls - you go directly to them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to the problem drinking remained silent as students on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, help Wohnberater, monitor the side and a student, if that too many status updates postet.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can't solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who had not been found different."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also zapft constantly to the data of its own people.</seg>
<seg id="28">The data team the side has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Happiness index compiled (which were used in the first place, according to which only Facebook has access, master of digital freedom have long known that the side should make their big data treasure trove for others for research purposes.)</seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook know that the side is watching them, whether they like it or not, in order to be able to play with a friend who is thousands of miles away, Scrabble, one page allows apply their own personal data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook are part of a survey that they do not even know something?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have set strict guidelines on how they collect their data offline and online everything is permitted.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles Neil Selwyn, a sociologist says," the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public sides of students on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="33">"What they are concerned, it was all about them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a user profile and contributions are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two entirely different things," said Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research must take care of the social aspects - and plenty of social life will take place still offline."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": Contrary to Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Contrary to Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed two Amokläufe, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" Kämpfer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple Knight of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations that support hate ideologies and because multiculturalism is being supported."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Judges Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik, did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, he refused to Breivik, mitbrachte a pre-written speech, permission to turn at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered that another 12 weeks retains the police for Breivik in custody, four weeks he has no access to the media, he said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All participated with the aim that everything comes down to a wegschließen.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought he cold and inhuman acts," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was embarrassing, but for me it goes a little bit after I have seen the suspect and heard."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and helped throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered the building and left again.</seg>
<seg id="15">In spite of Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" Bewegung, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">It may please some that the attacks on 22 July was apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radical.</seg>
<seg id="17">But that facilitates automatically the heartache and the confusion that still feels a whole nation?</seg>
<seg id="18">"I wish that he looked like a monster, but that does not do it," the family of a victim said.</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.</seg>
<seg id="3">What will Apple's fans, but perhaps the most recently discovered in the jobs-interview, which was dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets, is how much this has understood creative head business processes and procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous detail organizer who eagerly Measures Have Been cobble Together in Diagrammen - a man who believed that many managers suffering from "a disease of thought" that "a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] it is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series' triumph of specialist idiots "at the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with jobs together, in which they had a rare, detailed talks.</seg>
<seg id="6">At that time, since Jobs was driven from Apple had passed than 10 years, and already he worked hard on his new computer company next and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part used by Cringleys interview in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview were missing in the supply.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only after Jobs death we discovered a complete VHS-copy in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: The Lost interview," which comes this Wednesday and Thursday in the country Mark-theatre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is known that he loathes detailed interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly keen in explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">Incredible and wonder where U.S..</seg>
<seg id="12">During the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds inward, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts and trying to accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments when Jobs' perfect day comes when he responds to questions and seemingly impatient Cringelys anschubst him respond more quickly to issues or alongside acts of greater importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Included in the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone the Been Lost to interview seems somewhat sinister far-sighted if Jobs assesses what other companies make his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to read eulogies posthumous career jobs. "But jobs to be seen here as the thrill of greediness dreamer, who is on the leap to the grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things could be, and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after he had this here said everything, he went off and made it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As he learned to lead a company:</seg>
<seg id="20">"Throughout the years in business, I always ask: 'Why do you play?' And the answer that you always have is: 'Oh, it will simply made."</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, and no one in the business really thinking carefully about things.</seg>
<seg id="22">What I have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs from leading his efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Puzzled how costs were recorded, mostly began with "standard cost" that have been put on mere suspicion, and were then reviewed with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the transaction costs could be determined by-.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As the pope was kidding:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs told of the "Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could creep into the long-distance telephone company and result in vain.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the device much has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a gebührenpflichtiges phone, make a phone call and then link from an AT & T-network to another, while they slip through so many satellites as possible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We sent on half a dozen times around the globe and if you grölte into the phone, there came a minute later in the telephone next door," Jobs tells kichernd.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world can control."</seg>
<seg id="31">Both of us, we knew not much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that there would be without it, Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs told on a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he almost have taken to phoning up in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and the pope wanted to speak with while they have made them so well after Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk with the American diplomat, who both had to loslachen before the Pope himself came up the phone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he falls into the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett turned):</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years he sought when after spare parts to build a frequency meters, he sought after Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part-time at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views, which was a company and how it treated well his staff."</seg>
<seg id="38">Later jobs of the HP-staff who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer, which was ever produced."</seg>
<seg id="39">He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown ruling tarmac and I love with me in it.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would climb at HP as teenagers and hang on this machine and programmes to write them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">As it improves innovation:</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health legislation, the court case takes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day when the Supreme Court puts behind closed doors to discuss the political part end question will be whether to hear an appeal against the health legislation by President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas took part in a dinner that was gesponsort of the services that will take the case to court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases handled was a complaint who have collected 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which decided last year by Congress, a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the United States for the slogan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed with the hearing. Indeed, a 5 1 / 2-hour in March expected bases discussion that will probably be the result likely to boost the presidential campaign in 2012, which will be given at the time, in which the court ruling, in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer, who will stand trial and claim that is to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a veteran group that is dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which the law challenge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the process is hugely involved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, America's the group leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health care reform</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: The two judges attend events of the federalist society for years.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that does not violate moral rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, free judges from the code of conduct to govern the actions of the lower federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were to fall, they would be under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in beneficial initiatives law near and other organizations, and the judges must not be a spokesman, guest of honor or according to programme a host of such events."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas on two of the case in related departments and ranged from a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert morality-and-government activists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court consider themselves to the same rules that apply to all other federal judge Bob Edgar, president of Common said," cause-, a civil rights movement in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trial at the court."</seg>
<seg id="20">Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say that they too would court matter easily with groups based on the agenda as the federalist society mix, for example.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">However, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was state attorney general under the Obama Administration, when the first law disputes came in the first instance trial.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their critics pressed Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias because she had committed too much in the defense of the law, to be impartial.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan is not about to do so.</seg>

<seg id="3">Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner in Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is really a rare news that a company gets a contract over 50 of its products.</seg>
<seg id="5">But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co and the list price for these 50 aircraft at a record total of 18 trillion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Equally unusual in charge of Boeing: The Middle East, a growing gold mine of future plane orders.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East needs over the next 20 years, 2.520 aircraft worth 450 trillion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Boeing announced at the weekend its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two standard Boeing 777 jets.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hammer mission came from the Dubai airline Emirates.</seg>
<seg id="10">The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more planes that the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.</seg>

<seg id="12">The list price for six of these aircraft stands at more than $1 trillion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">"It is absolutely positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora, stock market specialist man of Morningstar said.</seg>
<seg id="14">"The quality of this particular customers is very high."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.</seg>
<seg id="16">So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, and a rise in oil prices, which normally hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, not as damaging as the country on a higher oil price deserves.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is important because they are less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"They have a natural hedge," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for aircraft and helps to keep the rival Airbus SAS in check, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Boeing victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the biggest A350, which would compete directly with the 777-300ER.</seg>
<seg id="21">It postponed the introduction to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher Nutzlast and reach.</seg>

<seg id="2">Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo supported by the PRI in the race for governor posts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday, dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">According to the preliminary results Fausto Vallejo won by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"The intervention of organised crime throughout the election process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.</seg>
<seg id="6">"They asked threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... you have filled polling booths, built barricades... and people to vote for the PRI []."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.</seg>
<seg id="8">But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.</seg>
<seg id="9">The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Vallejo Claderon only seems to have beaten barely who had led in the polls before the election day.</seg>
<seg id="11">Calderon, the candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as winner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, currently the acting governor, came in at number three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left leadership for the presidential election in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="13">Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Michoacan has long dominated by drug cartels, which on marijuana, heroin and amphetamines have specialised.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is the homeland of President Calderon and Michoacan, he has chosen to launch in December 2006, a military-led offensive against drug traffickers.</seg>
<seg id="17">The violence still continues.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A PAN-mayor was killed a week before the election, during a public meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A victory for the PRI strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan appear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race probably is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory makes us look boldly into the next year."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta were fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic cuts weaken national security unnoticed. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon has already cut by $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts to about 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress reach no conclusion in the spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and's Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, 23% overall cuts and a freeze of many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such a large cut, carried out in such a rash way would make most of our shipping and construction projects unviable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously hurt," Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We were also forced to separate us involuntarily by a large section of our civilian staff and, as permitted the reduction would be implemented as quickly, we would almost certainly civilians in order to achieve the objective."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would destroy the faith of those who receive our military and seriously damage our alert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts were ultimately hit the combat troops, "said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"While the war time quotas are not affected by the seizure in the fight against terror directly to the serious intrusion into the basic budget adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Recruitment would be cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring to view that support the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The salaries of the staff would be cut, leading to late payments in war time traders and the legal and political support disrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago, and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Defense Ministry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would launch a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are strongly against these draconian act," the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they said Panettas letter published.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is a result with which we do not live, and it is certainly none that we should impose on us."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United winded and their commitment should not be allowed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or increase demands will be exempt from the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, despite his many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House could gather before he came to the top of the Pentagon's, and knows that he faces tough decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painting a gloomy picture, which could face - a military with skin, but without heart.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without ammunition."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is an air-defense without sufficient trained pilots."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a force that lacks morality and alert and is not able to keep up with potential opponents."</seg>
<seg id="26">"You can be a really angry."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta new details of how reductions "significant operational risks created: Delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions led our global operational and conflict intervention capability, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those who have already been tested and already in the early planning stage.</seg>
<seg id="29">On this list of fighter pilots also includes F35 Joint Strike fighter, a proposed new bombs plane who need next generation ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If we were to stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 trillion dollars, but advocates say that it is an important next step to build-up, so that potential dangers from China and other opponents can be averted.</seg>

<seg id="5">Alex Pourbax of Trans-Canada, said that the company remains confident that will ultimately approved the pipeline, albeit with a different course.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">This came after an announcement by the State Department last week, after which it is to postpone a decision on a federal approval to the project until the new possible course should be reviewed to avoid the area in the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large under water supply.</seg>

<seg id="9">"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who amass $illegal manner, it is not easy to make them work to invest or to use them for something else," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration stopped</seg>

<p>
<seg id="11">López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people who leave the country to find work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due partly to the immigration problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there, and these people are here and are looking for work, leaving the unemployment rise," he says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Undeclared work</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of black. Includes these INEGI under 60,38 percent of employees in the country, who work without paying into the social security coffers.</seg>

<seg id="3">The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse, is to provide answers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that the appointed on Sunday Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats compound cabinet, although when the new prime minister will take up his position is not yet clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I would like my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to deal with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner said the journalist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti does not explicitly confirmed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The "framework is now well established," he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government that is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of the debt into an intolerable level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new, the former EU Commissioner Monti led government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the euro politicians to regain the damaged confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The pressure to hurry bearing on Monti, accelerated by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years with 7% interest rates were, which represents the state in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members have spoken out against a majority of technocrats existing government that Monti is precisely.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The Parliament support</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="20">Opposition to his efforts or delaying the reforms could lead to a devastating attack by the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference to a failure of Monti's was a disaster, also pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="23">On Tuesday night to be completed the sitting round.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said his government had until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, last, despite predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms to bring forward the elections instead.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to include politicians into his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should only be for technicians, a reference to their concerns, given the pressure imposed by the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and the divisions between the parties, the inclusion of people from political life complicated.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In Costa Rica to play a dream, which for us is also implementing.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and until now it has been great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I was just once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly remain a few days there.</seg>
<seg id="13">For us, it is exciting to get our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you this, because the fans of the band are shown. They are the days before the concert working flat.</seg>
<seg id="15">What does her your most enthusiastic fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you, all these years to be on our side.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you to have waited so long and we're sorry to have taken so long before we got here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people are even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the greatest shows that we have had in the past 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they are fit for this concert made in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">Indeed, we have to play there inclination.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">As you have got to know their Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many of our friends are a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are always on the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua drive, together with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With an eye on the tour their giant shows have offered with many songs.</seg>
<seg id="28">What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Since we have never played there, we are also no borders.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few Song from each album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">She never repeats your repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">So why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe this is partly because we have nine plates and about 120 songs play. Everyone like another song, so the decision, which we will play each, is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="34">If we have two or three Song that we no longer have long been played, into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we have liked this Song, otherwise it could be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore, for the audience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour celebrates her your twenty history.</seg>
<seg id="37">If you look back, it is hard to believe you on your success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, total.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band, and over 20 years, it seems like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We also have further on this blessing and it is wonderful to be able to still make music together.</seg>
<seg id="41">We like us and we are delighted to produce music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we always wanted to visit again.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What was it for you to have participated in the birthplace of Grunge active?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are good with the people of Sound Garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising and very unusual, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="48">Sometimes a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle-group.</seg>
<seg id="50">Still sometimes we play together.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Garden on their tour, and we are delighted to still be friends with all of them and it does us to be part of this encountered Seattle-Sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is very unusual for a band like your is stayed together with the same musicians so long.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) fell 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than last for many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care for each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friend and musical avenues have opened, which give each individual freedom to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">One trusts the other, and its music. It could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with the glory has not always been easy; on the other hand, can make her thanks to your success always what wolltet her.</seg>
<seg id="58">As she strikes a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The way we have grown, has made it easier for us to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">As long as you think that the people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you've got the music and what it has created, respect, without being too keen to be a famous rock star, which has never interested anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">What memories you have in your other project Mother Love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I believe we have made very good Song and at the beginning, it was great.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were three years a band that had been issued by the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never a record.</seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore, who built with the band, friends. When I hear a song or photos, see, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me funny. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The domestic band Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that she knows their work, especially, Eddie Vedder, and the band have selected for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production sent us videos by various groups and the band liked best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can provide live, and this is certainly exciting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter whenever plays her live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that occurs to him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By whom you got to be influenced as Bassist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">So many +</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first to come to mind Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski belong...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many that I could all afternoon on the Bassisten who liked to talk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">As Pearl Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although they are no longer a fad?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all do not feel very close with the word Grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I think about it, come to mind the band, which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, nirvana and all other that emerged at the same time, if they are still important, I think this is great, because it is interesting to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially, their music was dark, now it is more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">So why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting, because I think there are a few Song on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly, but there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark Song, although they also have something positive in itself.</seg>
<seg id="83">Both the tears came to me when I heard they played like Ed. There are very dark Song.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if you are older and something drastic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend, it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two Song embody that clear for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">However, I also believe that you can be a happy man and make yet dark music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects agree apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on the 16 gates will open the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona) (CMB, published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park was) in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that is not in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and below (sea.</seg>
<seg id="8">The classification Collserolas as a natural park plays with this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">As an example, not more of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild pigs in the role of Yogibärs served now.</seg>
<seg id="10">So far, as the city was in September of a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates purported after Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Undoubtedly points a gateway to the concept of a park.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone has to ask, gates to the countryside.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises of itself: Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city of the discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of that utilize old eingesessenen caste who meet in the lift.</seg>
<seg id="16">And it is this fact provides the fuel for one of the rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast on the "front line in the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been played out on the green apples.</seg>
<seg id="19">"We should start from the principle that Barcelona paramount is Park of the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because he is good.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "present the architect, for which carries the title" gates of Collserola "a lexical point trap": We should not be judged "as access to a park, but to act as a containment of areas where needs."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that has "some risk".</seg>
<seg id="23">Risks as a result of "insecurity, which brings the design of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, which were in the area of the Forum their "swan song."</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the own limit on what can be developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Something limit always means to determine the next step," meaning to cross him.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We must think about new urban planning tools, because the current [regarding the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can into a real disaster."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol, which is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola that goes in the direction of Valle Ana, "can be seen as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona," and for purely topographic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola that should not "on deaf ears," although he was grateful to the council that it has given his body the opportunity to participate in this project, "from the first moment."</seg>
<seg id="29">He also notes that the proximity of the city is the Geleitbrief, which should enable the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" whether this technical profile (the launched multidisciplinary teams' lead exactly the right thing, "he says) 'We architects should only be a tool."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article complex, with a global view ring hollow in the tendering conditions of Collserola: "It was advertised 16 contests in cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountain-sea. But there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."</seg>
<seg id="31">This has led at least in his case that he is participating in the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway through which the architect of the Tors then clash.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, the city should guarantee that the strip is directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so that a soft transition between city and green zones.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asphalt of the UNAM prevents bumps</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican university UNAM develops with Polymeren modified Asphalte to make the mixture more resilient to weather and temperature changes</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If looked at the signals emanating from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 blow holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México erupts (city area of the Valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) said at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the adoption Asphaltbelags appropriately, reduces the number of bumps considerably or even avoided altogether.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture "blow holes from a technical point of view," he felt during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the lab, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing to the asphalt similar mix, but it contains a major mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they make the road surface his typical zähelastisches behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Zähelastisches behaviour of asphalt means that it behaves in high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, with 120 ° C, he is a tough negotiator liquid and nearly 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"This means that the resistance is not the asphalt on the roads a uniform, but at a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes," the chemical engineer said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road surface, which together have from six layers of material, of which the last three asphalt dissidents.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among the top layers to wear a layer of asphalt, which is composed of small, asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones deck.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Every single piece of this wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles travel out and produced forces, this class makes a good power distribution in the road surface.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better," the chemical engineer said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Wear layer on which he said," "is interpreted a final layer that so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was bathed in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since these shifts are in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater force than the mechanical wear layer and it must produce friction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The road surface receives the most forces and spread, the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is, will need to be maintained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather, especially humidity and temperature changes, are other important factors to consider, above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behavior of wear layer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the site is damp, water invades the class and is just difficult. That causes a softening of all strata of the surface and as a result, the incidence of blow holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a pothole occurs, "he said," will first flattened the deck class, while the wear layer will affect only later, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process which maintained at the first signs of proper maintenance programs should be kept. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The Member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system of Mexico) declared that the vehicle weight is another important reason for the incidence of blow holes, so the thickness of each layer of the surface should always be in proportion to the vehicle weight and it must be ensured that this rule is to prevent frequent blow holes observed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera pointed out that many were still waiting for research, for example on Asphaltemulsionen who were in other countries, even in the market, and with which the bumps could repair simply and without application of high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="1">What was missing the candidate del Valle, to be the new Miss Colombia?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Analysis of the factors that played out that Melina Ramírez Serna not received the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="3">El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Once again, Valle del Cauca came empty in the award of the crown of Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time, had to be content with Melina Ramírez Serna to stand on the winners podium to ask a silver crown and the bond, which will allow it to be seen as new Miss Colombia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico Zeder took the crown and that in itself, it's already comes to 14 Miss title and Melina Bellini Region to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had kept the crown almost in the hands, on the proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia) Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The big question facing many today, is: What was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result is in line with the decline of a big favourite, who had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, but not in vain, she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Joly of vogue, title, which had also received the beauty of King inside Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia with home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor as crucial for the decision of the jury, the First Miss to appoint them, is that they are the answer to the question, "What book has influenced you most and why?" Her of Martín Gómez Murillo of Carreta Literaria Leamos asked, was not convinced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of civilisation, ultimately, I believe that the book for my childhood coined the most, 'the little prince' is a very deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment I read 'guilt and atonement. "It is a book of universal culture that we should read all. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, that is' passions'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A response that did not like, firstly because of the concept of 'civilized' and secondly, because they had not said specifically how each of her called the book had influenced them.</seg>
<seg id="14">But after the conclusion of the ceremony Melina, quiet and happy with the result to be declared: "The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all the people: Please read a bit of 'The small Prince. "It is a great book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle burn.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the bevorzugte who had received all Beifälle pockets and in the run-up to all prices had made (catering-competition Oster, audience vote on the best handgeschneiderte suit and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously, what the Queen stresste who could not therefore shine on the stage."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it noted that in its first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although it appeared both safe, but it lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico were on display.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "as en casa" on Channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to Miss was crowned, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, after all, is not Queen."</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, Valle was at the end of the press from the road - a mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest could not convince the social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">There must be a reason, said that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they sought a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that she had worked before the participation in the competition in projects," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, which it said her in the stomach area had sinned. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good habits and good physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better, "but to say their problem with the fibrosis on gut, which for me was hardly say honestly expressed their marks on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos is of the magazine Cromos believe the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca had the surgery, which they had undergone.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The operations are: OK, but Valle should not be knew how they make it right.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been their strong point, and this point had to pay them. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National beauty contest, arose after the appearance in the bathing suit a cruel prediction that should be true in the night. It was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina had been a consolation prize to make them do not enjoy the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Regardless of whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina now takes up its rule year, although not as Queen, but to represent as Princess, a position which gives her the opportunity to appoint the National beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, they will go down as one of the queens, who had escaped despite their overwhelming reappearance of Cartagena the crown, in history.</seg>

<seg id="1">So was the work of the doctor, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A Lophoskopist from Cali referred as the man, who identified "Alfonso Cano," in history.</seg>
<seg id="3">The work of these officials plays a key role.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On November 4, a Lophoskopist of investigative unit of the prosecutor (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) did, "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week was cooperating Eliazar Gonzalez on-call time, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go five days into the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were that he should identify.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">In 2000, he moved after Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialises in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin is exposed to the friction of the hand and foot land.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano I put clothes for at least three days Eliazar pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="9">Great things expected him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Friday night, he flew by helicopter of Palmira after Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="11">He knew he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion was that the might of the man, who had to be guided the oldest guerrilla in the world, and therefore he should take the ten finger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">When he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because it was not the images he had seen in the mass media, in the slightest.</seg>
<seg id="13">He had no beard, was dressed as a pawn of the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But fingerprints are not lying.</seg>
<seg id="15">Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, one Pflanzkelle and a pocket torch Eliazar the fingerprints of the cadaver compared with those on the Abdruckblatt.</seg>
<seg id="16">He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Still the same night originating from Puerto Tejada was the man in charge of the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón to tell that it really was the leader of the FARC.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">At traces search</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali the commemoration, which gave the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was given very important.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many people are not familiar with our work.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the disintegration of a crime.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support investigations into accusations of murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the person arrested.</seg>
<seg id="23">In their arrest many criminals are presenting false documents or they have none.</seg>
<seg id="24">We will take them and they are looking for the fingerprints in the database.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The researcher told us that he had to grab a piece of theft in a wall of a house, because the thief had aufgestützt precisely at this point with his hand when he pulled a with jewellery and money full gestopften Safe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"Walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the shot around the hand and the offender, who had participated in several burglary identify," he recalled.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With the help of the fingerprints can also be exonerated murder suspects or strained.</seg>
<seg id="28">Recently, one death was found surrounded by bottles of spirits.</seg>
<seg id="29">The investigation that a family member might be under suspicion was suspected, and indeed a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.</seg>
<seg id="30">Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, but he is associated with the place where the crime was committed in context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would "taken by the object."</seg>
<seg id="32">If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a tape is used for the carriage.</seg>
<seg id="33">Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented," the expert from the CTI said.</seg>
<seg id="35">He said that not everything was portrayed as it in the TV series SCI.</seg>
<seg id="36">So as not everything is gold, which is conspicuous, is also not everything that you anything it touches, a fingerprint.</seg>
<seg id="37">But he can be used if it carries out an appropriate comparison.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The members of the movement of Ocupy Wall Street views on this Tuesday, the authorities in New York, when they tried again with a court warrant to enter the Manhatten-place after they were removed at dawn from the room and were trying to occupy another seat in the Big Apple.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Hundreds of demonstrators packed together before the's Zuccotti Square, on which they wanted to get a court order that allowed "outraged" the new tent at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement to the evacuation orders and occupied a park was further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Our idea is that, if the court allows us not to campen on the place, we are meeting in another place and continue the battle with legal means the return to's Zuccotti, sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the movement "Ocupy Wall Street."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Bray said that the response of "outraged" at the evacuation of their tent camp, which was ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came up in court, where Judge Lucy Billings was a ruling that banned the forced evacuation of the square and the demonstrators authorized the tent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Moreover, occupied the "outraged" a new park, which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, and property of Trinity Church.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">They were able to occupy the place for at least one hour, but after the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray can be no exact figures, he assured the Efe Agency that he had seen, including several journalists with handcuffs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The organization has claimed that it would have hundreds of people returned at this point, in which a delegation of religious leaders as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and arrived at the conciliation with the police.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the site's Zuccotti Square (a) closed to private ownership remains pending a court hearing, which is scheduled for this Tuesday, and the legality of the eviction took place at dawn to be analysed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Some of the demonstrators wore seat-driven photo copies of this court orders in themselves and they doled out. They gave them some policemen who reported the place will keep an eye on what had "some small clashes", as Bray, who had reported that police had beaten some protestors.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the place and the application of "laws, which were adopted after the occupation and to the demonstrators to return with their tents and other things that had used it before, in the parking ban."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear before the press, which is based on this judicial orders the re-opening of the square was lifted for the public transport and the demonstrators and the demonstrators, he pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and Schlafsäcken in this place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The mayor defended personally carried out the dawn of the evacuation's Zuccotti-square, arrested in which almost 200 people were, and which was adopted because the demonstrators roughshod "against the right."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Bloomberg said that he had given the order to clear the square, because it had become "a place in which the people were not the one, but cause to break the law and, in some cases, damage to other people," because "some shops had received threats" and the residents worry "about their quality of life."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"The evacuation at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg basically on the protection of the interests and not interested in protecting the interests of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, which accuses the mayor "of the press to respect."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The leaders of Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought about this action "for large" to organise the Thursday, together with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two months that take the protests since 17 September now.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and the spiral of a free fall from the beginning of March ends</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which had seen still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which empties into a nuclear crisis, and was the worst disaster that Japan the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems despite the difficult global economic situation to weaken.</seg>
<seg id="5">After three quarters of fall, the claims of the gross domestic product from July to September served to finally close this chapter, GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% on the year hochgerechnete quota.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The measured value in the second quarter of the financial year in Japan in March 2012 begins - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machines for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the drop of 0.9% for investments that have been recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively from Keynesian aligned yourself using the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.</seg>
<seg id="10">Japan is particularly woken up, thanks to the development of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.</seg>
<seg id="11">These variable rose by 1%, from the increased spending on cars, travel and leisure activities took place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The stigma of yen</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market after the yen, the Japanese currency - rests in one of the "haven currencies" of investors who are fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A., a privilege that like a tombstone in the accounts of exporting companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">With a tougher currency products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.</seg>
<seg id="15">Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda.</seg>
<seg id="17">"We must be very careful with the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">"The main task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will meet tomorrow with the vote of confidence in the new government.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="3">The future of Europe was not originally intended in the program, but particularly in order to make those activists enough that the government policy regarding the Greeks today and tomorrow may assess Italy as too lax has prevailed in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Presidency motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only nine among 1001 delegates had voted against, ten of the voice had abstained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The standing ovation lasted several minutes, which were due to their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro-finance ministers open minded, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="7">The main idea of Chancellor bears - like the Antrage - following slogan: The answer to the crisis "not less but more Europe."</seg>
<seg id="8">Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly from the euro."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For the Chancellor is the time "come for a breakthrough in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="10">This could through the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the eurozone expressed; as it could, however, in the election of the president of the European Commission to lead on the basis of a general vote "in order to give Europe a face."</seg>
<seg id="11">However, this is definitely one of the amendment proposals adopted by Congress, which Wolfgang Schäuble godfather was clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Certainly, there is little likelihood that the 47 states agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ-Britain is opposed to the cause, and the CDU Leitenden believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.</seg>
<seg id="13">The milestone is placed, however.</seg>
<seg id="14">As the delegates in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board under the weight of individual economies, which would obviously an awakening of Germany's position.</seg>

<seg id="1">What represents the fraud in sick news?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the family benefits UMP and government are now the sick reports.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, visiting a family aid coffers and make a speech about it - already since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to review the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, is no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers sick reports.</seg>
<seg id="5">First, with budget economic objectives: The government is aimed at introducing a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick reporting for workers in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In plain terms, this means that a sick worker without approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A Maβnahme who create, according to the daily newspaper Les echoes' anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the (to go along with another Maβnahme rather symbolic nature: The civil servants a unvergüteten Karenztag in disease case so far, there are) for them, in one of the three Gegensatze Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, these issues in the debate are also generates the majority of the fraud issue, with the abuse associated with Arbeitsabsenz mind this time.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Checks will be much more important, and moreover, this rückzuvergüten if requested Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November warned," before the microphone are the station RTL.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of this story appear on the reality of fraudulent acts unproportioniert in terms of sick reports a little.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is, in fact, already the subject of constant scrutiny since 2002 and political offensive operations, which have borne most fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are not more frequent ill than people elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, we stayed in the first nationwide paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the country hospital fund CNAM more than 237 million euros days were paid compensation in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Gemäβ of Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care daily compensation in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros represented 5% of health spending.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under this amount 46% on maternity leave, as well as accidents and 54% Krankheitsurlaube concerning the heiβt fell 6.2 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="18">And, therefore, 2.5% of health.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French were allowed to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma consultation group averaged just 14.5 sick days.</seg>
<seg id="20">An average, which was certain differences masks: Another in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, published, showed that 75% of 40 000 surveyed, French workers claimed to have taken no single Krankentag.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of the sick were reported in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with its European neighbours, the French workers tend not more so than elsewhere on sick leave.</seg>
<seg id="23">One in 2010 by two researchers of the French, state Centre for Science Research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that the global Absenzquote oszillierte between 1994 and 2001 (away or otherwise justified), and in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in sick news represents a tiny proportion in the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="25">Regarding the fraud is achieved only a weak Ausmaβ.</seg>
<seg id="26">Encouraging legislation since 2002, that there are systmatische controls on sick reports, the 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, the CNAM (public university has found for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the lost 285 enjoyed, short-term sick reports, the heiβt unjustified in 37.050 cases, "or were too long."</seg>
<seg id="28">The systematic controlled sick reporting cases of more than 45 days duration to be counted among 1.2 million 11% "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, the heiβt 132.000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This makes a total so 169.000 "unjustified" cases to millions of workers who have made a sick reporting.</seg>
<seg id="30">A paragraph that represents only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, that of the black economy.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP-Member Dominique Tian, author of a July Sachberichts published on this issue, is that between 9 and 15 billion tax loss of earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation at last.</seg>

<seg id="5">Only 9% of a Canadian who can actually out to talk with their doctor about conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, which are linked in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">This body recommends the government to amend the penal code so to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent company EIU, the death of quality in 40 countries of Erdballes had compared with each other.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada has placed in the 10th grade, the study notes that the rate of medical care in Canada "has created a culture in which people are raising fear, the subject of death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medical care or not: 77% of Canadian who have no access to painkillers, of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts tell us.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the majority of Canadians wish to die at home, but ultimately 68,6% of them die in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Viewed from across the country, the rate of 86% of deaths that have occurred in the hospital in Quebec is highest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are threatening the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert to want to make any changes to the penal code on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But now there are loud legalization experts who have inspected gleichermaβen all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide or have entkriminalisiert would not draw any proof that such decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, the practical implementation of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten einwilligenden persons or not.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, we meet far more cases of such transgressions, particularly in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalise as yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report confirmed in a teleconference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, practiced."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Also assisted suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly here illegally," says Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The euthanasia Canadians</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us that in the year 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted-already-85% of the Canadian who geäuβert itself in favour of euthanasia, as they are of the opinion that they would like it to alleviate people at the end of their lives, their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia was not meant to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled besäβe less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">With regard to the people who have already used an assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">With regard to maintenance or suspension of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">They also suggest in its recommendation list that should be mentioned in the penal code that the dumping of the funds, which have a legal rejection of operation, not as a criminal should apply.</seg>
<seg id="24">The panel also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task of having to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and fear that without prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The panel said that governments, institutions, healthcare facilities and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment to put the best limited resources, and on the cases of cancer alone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The panel also calls on the already in the Canadian institutions to far-reaching health care funds used for pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take them at least in recital, since they served as little as the euthanasia to reduce physical pain and these and IT IS refers to the same procedures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other experts reservations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the judicial area of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report by the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Ra Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health law, has the attitude of the report undersigned experts, among other things, as "extremely" because they have the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages of any borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who lives tired and older than 18 years is to ask another person to help him in his suicide," Ra Deschamps, who had looked at yesterday a summary of the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ra Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appeared on the ownership of the individual to make all other values that are involved in social knitted society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">But now, he says, there was "guidelines and commitments in a society."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Margaret Somerville, specialist on health law, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which they described as "pro-euthanasia-manifesto."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questions, in particular, the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="11">Therefore, Germany remains blebt isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision of the need for a substitution capable replacement source to find, even in Switzerland, which barely intends to build only nuclear power plants in the last generation.</seg>

<seg id="20">Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a contrary to our French households by 40% higher electricity bill.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key part of competitiveness and a stability deposit of industry on national soil, the French companies have given the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.</seg>
<seg id="22">Any significant reduction of nuclear power would draw a strong increase in the price of energy, which could be the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of illusion.</seg>

<seg id="2">Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised from many corners - overwhelmed by police, judicial and administrative bodies subordinated the figures due to a policy of reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had call themselves.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had shaped by administrative side the weeks look, the Interior Minister had passing (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "no talent, bricklayers or waiter from abroad was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="4">But this policy has been analysed rarely from the economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.</seg>
<seg id="6">From the right side of the tone was echoed by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that 900 000 unemployed, including particularly about 2 million should include "workforce, no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not the whole of poverty in the world."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference in the level of Groβzügigkeit</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fear of invasion of the national land by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 from both the right and the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is in the extent of Groβzügigkeit, it is willing to admit the immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalities, who point out that partnership development will permit it to solve our "immigration."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can influence the elections; but it is economically costly.</seg>
<seg id="13">As the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book illustrate that the latest findings on the immigration summarises (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.</seg>
<seg id="14">The immigration would limit the growth sap and damage the labour market situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears over the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workforce, particularly the less skilled, by exercised pressure on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows, however, that the immigrants in truth are complementary as much as the local wage workers as they exercise schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that are unausgelastet job technically.</seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which these attract little domestic wage workers, the higher quality among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors where the training is not aligned with the offer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive effect pay</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesisten, so does this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic employment situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants are disabled person leads a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 percent and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And without taking into account the fact that the immigrants sponsored by the diversity of ideas is conducive to the creation and growth (high proportion eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel laureates, Google, Intel, micropayments, eBay, Yahoo, and were founded by immigrants).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants also contribute to the social welfare net, in the European countries, on average, around in a 1% of the overall budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that an aged 30 years after Germany einwandernde person brings the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of the 150,000 euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate to the lack of average points "with the teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">These aforementioned teeth that should deter the immigrants, reached exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe connects directly with Russia, was put in operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to mark the event with pomp and ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="5">About 500 directors, including four leaders, last Tuesday have participated in the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung Feinschmeckerbuffet and at the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the sea level directly with each other.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have turned a symbolic way along the helm of Ventils, which transports Russian gas to Western European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With the new pipeline additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year are to be delivered by a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length, which links the region of Saint Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, according to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second pipeline, which allowed a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">And it is already hinting the possibility of building a third transmission route for themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Gazprom point for the timely and accurate completion of this huge building are an important element acts like a victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project was in Poland and the Baltic States sharply disputed.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany and to avoid any lines running through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: For them, it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close down the access to western European markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not spared from back to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German and tables pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this at the expense of an enfeebled European energy, because the project has created a rift between West and East European.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has run it brought in almost five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and their gas running out to enforce.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing to what extent the groβen gas contracts are also of political and economic side.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smile of Lubmin number of Gazprom managers about the Gaszuleitung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter, which they should protect against Schiffsankern.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed, in about 200 metres depth.</seg>
<seg id="24">In its construction from the Second World War previous minefields had to be sidestepped.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream stated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Auβerdem had increased Maβnahmen for the Protection of fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The leadership is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme, who is suspended over the entire length by nothing, either through outlets or maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project developers have held back from as the Swedes were not eager to see a Russian state company settle on permanent way to level their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of an accident, we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the event of a leak in the pipeline that the gas escape into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">This case is seen by designers as little, however, probably because the Schweiβnähte was estimated at a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The state control of the gas pipeline will ensure both from an underwater-robot, which circulates on external controlled surveillance purposes by a seagoing vessels from being, as well as by a device inside the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and move through the gas pressure.</seg>
<seg id="34">After three full days of transport by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device on his arrival provides detailed information on possible deformations such of metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without having to undergo the slightest repair.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Gaszirkulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">It is $200 cash at Zutritts-, 100 cash at the exit point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have united on the implementation of this project their forces.</seg>
<seg id="39">The leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">The German companies E. on and BASF are here (ever) attached to 15.5%, as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez) (depending on 9%.</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It is based in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom has also rented out the entire capacity of this society Gastransportes at renewing Twenty-year-contract.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how could plunge large is the real animals transported gas volumes," Jens Müller clarified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment was 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">The minority shareholders are gewiβ, however, to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline is on a sandy, with jaws forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.</seg>
<seg id="50">The 4.5 metres high outlets form the Gasaustrittspforte.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the material gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday this terminal will be supplied with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour verstreichende.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a determined public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice as high as the average average: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit contrary to 9% of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?.</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the association stresses adaptation, which targets the" week of work for the disabled. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"The inside of 15 years are considerable progress."</seg>
<seg id="8">"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nevertheless, there is still a huge amount to do."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said, however, that persist for the unemployed disabled still many obstacles before they get a job.</seg>
<seg id="11">More often, it affects the elderly: 37%) are older than 50 years (17% on average.</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared to 38% in the overall average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, there are so many criteria that a new work a rose, and the "core of the problem form," Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the factual brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">Remains the underlying implication, the mentalities, certainly, but developed slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A in April by the Association of IMS-entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study was that the surveyed managers have "a weak knowledge level on the disabled," the "over-represented" was "from people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually weak by."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now at the 3%," Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is charged with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law reports.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof: The number "fees zahlender" plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 reduced, zahlenmäβig of 59.000 on 46 000 (and of 606 at 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The Act of 2005, which provides for increased contributions created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc said."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement is also a real insight, particularly the groβen firms groups."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry of Labor employ only 59% of plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 workers against 82%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Portugal very confident</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento looks groβem optimism with the return leg against Bosnia (22: 00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two teams had Hinspiel lacked the practicality.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."</seg>
<seg id="5">Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that La Selecçao, "his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible for September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship" 2012.</seg>
<seg id="7">For Portugal, this means, in fact only 90 minutes Beatitudes.</seg>
<seg id="8">But there are abzuservieren a match to play, and an opponent, and Bosnia.</seg>
<seg id="9">In view of the Hinspiels (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the die has not yet been cast.</seg>
<seg id="10">Portugal dominated for more than an hour clear the game, but the team was not able to put the matter in the important stamp, which would have taken the pressure of her.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"This is a good result, which carries some risk, however, because we have reached no Auswärtstor."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">At home, however, in their brightly erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese convinced themselves before an audience that should be equally heiβ on the game, even if the game was announced, of course, as a "very close," the optimistic but lucid Bento said.</seg>
<seg id="13">"We expect a very close match, are convinced, however, completely from being able to gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.</seg>
<seg id="14">"We have to continue to be a 50% chance in the European Championship in 2012," however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz seen in relative term.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The draw on Friday in Bosnia to force the Portuguese to reach and win a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="16">A draw can meet the Bosnians, who also have a gateway necessary.</seg>
<seg id="17">"This is a good result, which carries some risk, however, because we have reached no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We will come up against a team that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.</seg>
<seg id="19">As in Zenica, the Portuguese were already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "admit them no time for reflection."</seg>
<seg id="20">A good idea, provided that it is implemented this time.</seg>
