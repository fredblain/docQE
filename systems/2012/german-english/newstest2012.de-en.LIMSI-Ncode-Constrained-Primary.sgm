<seg id="1">Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert, a bit too much substance to it was the beginning. </seg>
<seg id="3">Since I was not aware at all, which is still. </seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is expected to be even worse. </seg>
<seg id="6">The closer examination, more information and practical challenges are before us. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But even if the course is held on Saturdays and Sundays, yet it is well documented. </seg>
<seg id="8">This time we discussed with the director Alena (the course is not a single man), as it attracts a woman who has not been a perfect proportioniert figure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And that is, after all, most of us. </seg>
<seg id="10">Some people have a short neck, the other a young figure without proper trends and others are mollig. </seg>
<seg id="11">It is a matter of Stylist, broad shoulders to conceal optical, to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern bends. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - that is, with a large bosom, wide hip and all slim waists - beautiful and attracts figur stressed, without being overly provocative. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example the difference between Taille and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit, should be at least a piece of schneidern. </seg>
<seg id="14">This will certainly not regret, because good clothing is simply unaffordable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made coat you feel much better than in a bar, go high and verrutscht Taille absteht, etc. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Young people can afford, in turn, clothing with wrinkles, baus, Applikationen, embroidery or Raffung to bear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">With this amount of information and figur types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I will do everything thoroughly. </seg>
<seg id="18">And yet I am afraid that in view of the assigned homework is almost impossible to achieve. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the teilnehmerins rate was allocated a Promi, for which it is to come up with suitable attire - clothes and evening. </seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, we are the current design, the fashion style of the star and his Figurtyp. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I am supposed to Miranda Kerr, " " you may be out of the campaign, Victoria Secret know. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">I juble inside, because for me personally, this is much better, for example, than Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, in recent times has grown to more than 100 kilos (' oh well, that is a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The garments we always envy in magazines or on the Internet, first and then represented graphically. </seg>
<seg id="24">In the "mood board," as the outcome is known, then our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings. </seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist models not only physically, but also makes the so-called product side in the Journal (after a specific target, for example handtaschen, Mäntel, etc.). </seg>
<seg id="27">They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník. </seg>
<seg id="28">But the first Sunday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The filled Saturday with information on Figurentyps was tempered by three visitors from the industry. </seg>
<seg id="31">The Stylist, Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion and Stylist should be able to take advantage of this. </seg>
<seg id="33">And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways. </seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word is variability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">This can be such a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but can also bear on the naked body, to attract sales of shoes and wear it as a dress. </seg>
<seg id="36">It is enough, the sleeves and the collar hochzukrempeln, and the whole Look is quite different. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Does that," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">But most came the following advice: "First of all, you know what the rules are perfect." </seg>
<seg id="39">"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">At last, I understand why we need pauken all these doctrines, which you can combine with what and why, even if you fashion journal often gets to see quite different. </seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention of fashion schaus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed. </seg>
<seg id="43">So you have to be a Fashion story with ten pages (e.g. ten attire), be prepared for at least 15 stylen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And the clothes on the photograph in combination with other Accessoires sometimes looks very different than in reality. </seg>
<seg id="45">All of this must be expected in the form of attire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">The fact that image and, a sometimes make up half of the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný. </seg>
<seg id="47">Since you need only look at Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from which image and marketing a world star. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, the services of a rather reserved Stylist. </seg>
<seg id="49">Even celebrities often think this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I was of secondary importance). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if anyone can be stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she very likely a whole heap of other (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality. </seg>
<seg id="51">Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, writes back to the appropriate Promi or decreased, and so on. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Jan and Mario set us on Sunday not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "to assemble them." </seg>
<seg id="53">In his work, above all, he needs to communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a shrewd psychologist. </seg>
<seg id="54">People judge without anzubiedern and his opinion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If we have a director appointed to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces, then we cannot get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible." </seg>
<seg id="56">"We need at least a few worthy things, which recommends what you can do about it," says Mario. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us exactly what a so-called "job" must include. </seg>
<seg id="58">So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Apart from such obvious things, such as scissors, hair removal or security nadeln Abroller they also contains such Utensils as nylon thread (a Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or avoid) specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big (electric nadeln or other Klemmes are prohibited, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">This means that we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to get it right. </seg>
<seg id="61">Even in the case of photography at the Atelier, where the floor is, you can damage the shoe base, let alone the outside. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We have o klebten and klebten.... </seg>
<seg id="63">With the gap, we must not even touch the shoes, so that they are not damaged. </seg>
<seg id="64">So we really need to be sent. </seg>
<seg id="65">Mario delighted me by my "creation," praised without restrictions. </seg>
<seg id="66">The aforementioned skill is not exactly my strength. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs. </seg>
<seg id="68">One thing is now clear - to address the Styling at professional level, is not an easy task. </seg>

<seg id="23">In the mountains, in turn, must be extremely careful that we will not be buried by an avalanche. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">By the way, are fairly well incorporated the individual race. </seg>
<seg id="25">Although only a few, but they are insufficient. </seg>
<seg id="26">For a while trying to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent. </seg>
<seg id="27">And also interfering with the police, who wants to blow the whole thing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car. </seg>
<seg id="29">This is more about some interactive Animations, in which Jack fleeing anybody else, and where he must help the players by pushing the right button at the right moment. </seg>
<seg id="30">So there is nothing complicated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (concrete only three). </seg>
<seg id="32">Ultimately, it is more likely to benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above mentioned on the elements that make the game more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">This model is in the Fußtapfes of the previous sections. </seg>
<seg id="34">In other words, from today's viewpoint, no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be a bad thing. </seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="36">But a troubled Rennfahren, the local model will continue to perform very well, even though the competition could be better. </seg>
<seg id="37">In the meantime, so far, everything is fine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems are emerging only after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="39">In contrast to the model, the model is not quite OK. </seg>
<seg id="40">From a game of this type, it is hard to expect that it is difficult to calculate Deformations and collisions, but if you virtually no impact on any idea how the car is, then it is obviously not everything is in order. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A typical example: at the close or passing of oncoming cars "touched upon" the other car in some places only slightly in the other, almost identical situation but tailspin and wild performance. </seg>
<seg id="42">Or the same scrap metal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the Restart-Systems is nothing more of it is annoying. </seg>
<seg id="44">The remaining arts are resolved: if you write-off or ends up far away from the route, then throws the game back to the last point of the route. </seg>
<seg id="45">Only - in every race, only five remaining arts. </seg>
<seg id="46">If you have exhausted them, everything is going on. </seg>
<seg id="47">Thus, the arts are more such a thing as a tool for the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it should not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes it helps, but not even the Restart, because nothing else helps to learn the critical section from the head. </seg>
<seg id="49">It is extremely unfortunate that the same things often happen in the same places. </seg>
<seg id="50">Some of these trends must be the case in a very specific way, otherwise we simply do not fit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere at the appropriate juncture "civilian" cars are always in the same configuration, no matter whether it was the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute. </seg>
<seg id="52">This is particularly troublesome in situations when you see that the opponent romped to two oncoming cars, but even before they arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must navigate around or slow down. </seg>
<seg id="53">And it is no matter when you arrive, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have even more advantages. </seg>
<seg id="55">In the whole game, there are a few places where you are always in the same place will be overtaken by the same opponents, and here again without regard to the timing. </seg>
<seg id="56">The most madman's is at the end of the game on the long bridge, which is happening in the body. </seg>
<seg id="57">The opponent must seem hell bent on overtaking. </seg>
<seg id="58">And if he is, then he is, of course, the view, so they started their own car a few times in Klump. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">What is clear - we want the game to simply make it more exciting and exciting events, but this desire is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game. </seg>
<seg id="60">And that is a pity, because, despite einfacherem model is the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes action that you almost no longer know where it is one of the head. </seg>
<seg id="61">And, in principle, no matter what "guilt" - the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that no boredom can pay, or something completely different... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is also a change in the course of the race. </seg>
<seg id="63">We must not overlook garages, because it is precisely here that we can change the car, even though in most cases, the car is good enough. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories. </seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines on the highways and exotic sportwagen for the technical crews, for example on the Serpentins in the mountains. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the modus operandi of the story is also the aufgaben mode (challenges) - that is, the race in the individual situation, which we know from history. </seg>
<seg id="67">This is not just medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, the common tasks (challenges) and history. </seg>
<seg id="68">In order to get to higher levels, various objects need to be open-minded, ranging from the car to the grounds for the profile. </seg>
<seg id="69">This is at the same time with the role of online Autolog, which, among other things, the results are compared with those of other players, and also provides for further collective functions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of the other incomprehensible Schnitzers is a situation in the last race of the story. </seg>
<seg id="71">This is the car in an underground rail tunnels (perhaps), where we were in the dark on the rails long night (or, for that matter). </seg>
<seg id="72">The Tacho look points between 150 to 200 km/h (say), but there is a subway and a tough scrap. </seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorial, we will probably still argue about whether a blackout of the decision was or whether the authors believe to be so stupid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is not Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall picture is, in most cases quite attractive, and here and there, even brilliant. </seg>
<seg id="75">It is all the more galling is that in a few exciting moments, the wiederhol rate is slower, and sometimes quite dramatic. </seg>
<seg id="76">This is particularly the case with greater numbers of do where a continuous FPS does not work anyway. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The Tonwiedergabe is OK, and the sound track is a matter of taste. </seg>
<seg id="78">The effort so broad as possible to raise more young audience, a sound track (a lá "of all things" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall picture of Need for steroids: The run? The feelings are more mixed. </seg>
<seg id="80">If the game does not mention totally unnecessary mistakes would be diminished, we would have been able to argue with a true ring of conviction that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="81">But the game seems somehow unfinished. </seg>
<seg id="82">For a class of pleasure, but we should be prepared to make a mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye. </seg>

<seg id="1">Eu-botschaft Vicenová: </seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Euro-sceptics </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The Treaty of Lisbon has the balance among the various institutions from the road." </seg>
<seg id="4">I would not expect that there is such a tough war." </seg>
<seg id="5">"It will take five, six years until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to her new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation very strongly to the legal faculty. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded, the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a straightforward and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to admire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role is not equal, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause. </seg>
<seg id="9">"He is a man of twenty-seven Member States listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all has clear ideas about how to move forward with the EU. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then answer to the question: who is the real - the European Union? What number I should call? ," in other words, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the EU's policy towards countries such as China or India. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants us to ban our Ölmützer Quargel </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, is alive and wants to live in the near future. </seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, described it as a success. </seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs had the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also held the summit for the Eastern Partnership. </seg>
<seg id="15">In the case of the government during the presidency, described it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU currently has to do all hands full. </seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which until now has not yet overcome quite hectic. </seg>
<seg id="18">And since the seven-year budget must still be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation makes it much more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="19">Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, what sectors of the economy must take precedence, which countries and which are less favoured - all of this is now on the agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador also reminds me of their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "This is understandable about Europe." </seg>
<seg id="21">"If I do not like something, then it is gräulich words, phrases and jargon that no one understands. </seg>
<seg id="22">How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and various large bananas invented or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel. </seg>
<seg id="23">It would have been the land of the EU would also like to be used to get more Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe two or different speeds in prospect </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the EU Ambassador, the Czechs are reputed to be the Eurosceptics more negative than the positive side of the story. </seg>
<seg id="26">All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions. </seg>
<seg id="27">There are many factors to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write motivierung letters, and not least the weak support from the Czech side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4. </seg>
<seg id="29">"Believe me, if Poland or Hungary comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, then the Frenchman believes, in addition to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is that your V4? " and makes a pretty sour face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Ms. Vicenové, expect the EU in future, above all, tough rules on the budget policies of the Member States. </seg>
<seg id="31">As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone. </seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation." </seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should cooperate, they want and not want to be left out." </seg>
<seg id="35">"It is becoming more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" Europe of different speeds, " " expects Mrs Vicenová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all Member States, and not only by the countries of the euro zone. </seg>

<seg id="1">Fire story: </seg>
<seg id="2">The IBM innovator enters into the second century of its existence </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If you are looking for an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM, at the very least, then this would be the word "longevity." </seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public is IBM a synonym for technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, even though since its founding a century has passed. </seg>
<seg id="5">The basis for this longevity has been its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, senior </seg>
<seg id="6">He was the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan "Think!" has become the hallmark, which should take the life of the future giant (and at the same time to the title of the company's internal magazine, IBM has been the year 1935 began). </seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture. </seg>
<seg id="9">"For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future. </seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also a whole century successful because it has been faithful to its principles and not shied away, everything else to change all around it. </seg>
<seg id="11">This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technology to transform the business and society. </seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that in the next hundred years, we will create even more," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from occasion of the anniversary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Durchdachtes system </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson has operations in the 1930s, social care of its employees - in a similar way as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers to pay for their holiday, insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders. </seg>
<seg id="15">Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was brilliant from the start in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly. </seg>
<seg id="17">In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the helm of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman, Virginia Rometty. </seg>
<seg id="18">It is already 30 years at IBM before they took the position of Vetriebs, marketing and strategy manager. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM makes so-called online brainstormings in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations. </seg>
<seg id="20">No wonder - ideas, there are enough, the company is almost half a million people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with good reputation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Their steadfast position in business is guaranteed the company a strong image and for domestic and foreign policy. </seg>
<seg id="23">"From the outset, IBM was more the concept of an institution than a mere technological criticize," said the professor in the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, rosa beth Moss Kanter. </seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve," said George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research. </seg>
<seg id="25">As the company itself pointed out, there is a difference, only to be present on the market, or directly to shape it through this presence. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - in the Member States of their logos because of family "Big Blue," is in a century to become one of the largest companies in the world has grown up. </seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, Hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products, from servers to the nanotechnology. </seg>
<seg id="28">Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff have already been awarded the Nobel Prize. </seg>
<seg id="29">Among his best-known inventions include, for example, banking machines, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or diskette. </seg>
<seg id="30">With approximately 220 billion dollars stock market value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second major technology companies (Apple), but it was the first time since 1996, Microsoft took over. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with their own operating system, OS/2, the online service, Prodigy, or even the IBM PC computers jr. </seg>
<seg id="33">"Business is based on moving forward, so we should not be emotional attachment to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano. </seg>
<seg id="34">This is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave again. </seg>
<seg id="35">In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system and falls. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="37">The profits of IBM in the highest degree of services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth. </seg>
<seg id="38">It was 1990 hardware with a more than 50 percent share in the most represented. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets to the value of 15 billion dollars in the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in buying more forward-looking technologies. </seg>
<seg id="40">In these investment IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world. </seg>
<seg id="41">IBM remained the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson, in the middle of the major global economic crisis increased its investment volume. </seg>
<seg id="42">So far, it seems that the company IBM is without prejudice to the current crisis. </seg>
<seg id="43">The value of IBM-Akties has increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and net profit of the company kontinuell is growing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The corporate slogan of IBM is this: everything can be changed - only the values do not. </seg>
<seg id="45">For that reason, too, can be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM-Geschichte: from that of shareholders cheese on weltall flights </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">A hundred years ago, society was founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation. </seg>
<seg id="48">According to the IBM name, they first 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America. </seg>
<seg id="49">According to the foundation for the subsequent company IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century. </seg>
<seg id="50">They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on the registration of the work begins. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett towel, until 1930, also the chair of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="52">And it was a towel, the head of the rival company, Thomas J. Watson, so that he helped in the management of the company. </seg>
<seg id="53">This leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadows - Watson's ideas is still the invincible culture and identity of the company. </seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952. </seg>
<seg id="55">IBM began, as the name tells us, with the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go. </seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and finance the company and on all continents. </seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so essential to the company that he 40 years sat in his chair, he was the first of his son, Thomas Watson younger replaced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under his leadership the IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, and also became the first Programmiersprache. </seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s, engineers and computer helped NASA by IBM to launch flights into space - to the Merkur and Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight of humans to the moon. </seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System/360. </seg>
<seg id="61">A classic PC, the computer standard of that era came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market. </seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM veräußerte computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand they bought the mom-and-pop part of the company's former price coopers and jumped wholeheartedly into the business with consulting benefits and services with high added value. </seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, which IBM is paying off in the last three years, is the concept of "smart planet." </seg>
<seg id="64">It is the intention, technology wisely has not even been planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the commercial sector, IBM, recently the platform "Smarter Commerce," which is intended to help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle. </seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, the SSR only five authorized state agencies: edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at that time were chosen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And so, Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">One exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it also was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, Yugoslavia then proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why the trips to Yugoslavia have been severely restricted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (Tschechoslowakes) was allowed in the framework of the socialist countries to travel freely. </seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen of the SSR individually for Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union wanted to travel, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, because otherwise, individual travel was not possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but huge queues had to accept or even in sleeping bags to be careful before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office. </seg>
<seg id="9">Even so, the issue has not gone for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovak currency was not a free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange commitment, so it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The majority of Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a habit that lasted until now. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989, a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million last year on their foreign holidays in countries of the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently most popular tourist destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it is part of the former Yugoslavia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century to the foreign exchange requirement was lifted into the neighbouring Western European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit to Vienna in Austria and Germany. </seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowakes have for a long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted at least a few days ago. </seg>
<seg id="18">For example, the Czech tourists slept on trips to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature on foreign travel of Czechs was a canned beer and sausage, etc., loaded baggage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our living standards and the average salary rose to 1997, einmündete in another important moment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agents began regularly in 1997, preparing to travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate quantity rabatte, compared to the past verbilligten unbelievable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, except the United States, foreign currency transactions with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" tourist traffic in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country after Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="25">Since then, every year to fly direct charter planes with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations. </seg>
<seg id="26">The Tsd 100 Czechs travel each year in exotic countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another important moment in the era that our "revolutionary" development marked came in 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The main aim is to find a new chairman - once again threatens a stalemate. </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">For nearly five months, the Czech football no chairman and threatens the Ivan Hašek successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday will be known in Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="3">To date, there is still no agreement on how the electoral system is to be elected. </seg>
<seg id="4">And without them there is no vote on the three potential successors. </seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and his colleagues urged the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality, which could lead the football in future. </seg>
<seg id="7">However, in the era after Hašek broke the old quarrels between the two chambers were once again not be able to agree on a joint candidate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was quite clear on 16 September, when the new chairman should be chosen. </seg>
<seg id="9">The main assembly delegates were in vain in the House of Commons in Prague's Smíchov district, because the trial produced no result, and it was not just about the election itself. </seg>
<seg id="10">You could not even agree who actually entitled to the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a full power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible. </seg>
<seg id="12">The disputes over the electoral system, however, continue to persist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the matter at its meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, absolutely nothing else on the agenda. </seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the views expressed in relation to the election changed a few times - the central point remained the same. </seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how should we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The bone of contention is the question whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether an entirely different model needs to be found," said Duan Svoboda, one of the three nden leaders of the FAR, who represents in the management of professional football. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to satzungsmäßigem model triumphs in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater expressed as support in the chamber, for which he is standing. </seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise, that the one candidate to win the higher number of votes from both chambers. </seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner in the percentage of the vote count at least a two-thirds majority. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Then, the two Vorrundes have absolutely no sense, this modus operandi would question the whole concept of bicameral," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best not to bend the electoral system, but according to choose applicable statutes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Surprisingly, this is also true Tomáš Paclík, even if it emerges that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="22">"My wish is that as much as possible will be elected in accordance with the Statute." </seg>
<seg id="23">"This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club), Victoria Plze, who is standing for the first time, and above all in its opinions from Pelta to abgrenzte. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta, however, remains optimistic. </seg>
<seg id="25">In his opinion, it will be known in Nymburk as the new chairman, and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively. </seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification of the national team for the Euro on this day would certainly help to calm the emotions." </seg>
<seg id="27">"If the football first ride on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec, all three of the Adepten has the most experience, both on a professional, as well as regional levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more circumspect. </seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is mixed." </seg>
<seg id="30">"This is not a matter between the people from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain rules for their own purposes," zurechtzubiegen ."" </seg>
<seg id="31">"That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly." </seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope, however, that common sense prevails in the end," Rajchl said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The only thing - much time remains for the agreement of all sides. </seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generalität until qualification will be complete. </seg>
<seg id="35">The charter plane, which, among other Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice in the morning in Prague did not start because of a technical disruption and so feverish for an alternative option, as a part of the executive committee but has yet to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Ultimately, it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobe, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties would have liked to within the country's largest sports associations to reach an agreement. </seg>
<seg id="38">There is a lot at stake: state aid, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the upcoming general meeting of the STV, the Czech sport in the wake of the financial problems of Sazka the new direction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík is in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer at the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met, he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position. </seg>
<seg id="41">"If there was a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up on the election." </seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation is not managed to find such a Adept," said Paclík TK. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for Paclík duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the top of the FAR. </seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stressed that in case he wins the post of chairman, only one year, until 2013, until the date of the general meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced " not too much involved in the football. </seg>
<seg id="46">"With some people coming into question, I have spoken personally." </seg>
<seg id="47">"It is extraordinary to think that some people said they wanted to do not currently identify with the Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="48"> "Such views would have liked to have changed," he quoted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The most troubling of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner county football associations, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence second votes on key meetings. </seg>
<seg id="50">For Paclík, for this reason it is unacceptable that Pelta the position of the chairman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"The current state in his victory would be einkonserviert and the Czech football, it would not move forward at all." </seg>
<seg id="52">"The support provided by Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, would get the football twice a bad thing," Paclík said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with abhörungen investigation in a corruption affair, fell out of the Pelta, however, emerged unpunished. </seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what a victory of Pelta (tsch) should play football." </seg>
<seg id="55">"And as we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said ekl Paclík, his former dictum, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, when Pelta chairman will be," but it already looks a little more calmly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">If Paclík win in the election, but he could certainly imagine a future cooperation with Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="57">Similarly, another candidate, Rajchl, Paclík had supported before the main meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go." </seg>
<seg id="59">"He has great qualities." </seg>
<seg id="60">"I would like him well, for example as head of the national team." </seg>
<seg id="61">"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager." </seg>
<seg id="62">"I don't desire my nose in matters of which I do not understand," said Paclík, which in September raised eyebrows - was that he was behind the recall of the referee commission with Luk Macela was at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík even claimed that he felt up to the role of the chairman. </seg>
<seg id="64">And it is relying on his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with his support in May, celebrated the first victory in the league. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment, and to a certain cultivation of this." </seg>
<seg id="66">"In order to limit the influence of certain special interest groups who tend to have an impact on disciplinary and appeal committees, which descends into horrific situations," Paclík quoted the example no secret of his antipathy to the sparta leader Daniel Ketínský. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of his priorities would be the consolidation of relations between the FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would lobbyieren the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax goes into the sport. </seg>
<seg id="68">"This is one of the key issues facing the new chairman should pay attention to." </seg>
<seg id="69">"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as the political parties to declare, then I understand their argument, but they must also make it clear where the money is going," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, even though he himself pointed out, the chairman of the FAR should be "bipartisan." </seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla. </seg>
<seg id="72">"This is not exactly ideal." </seg>
<seg id="73">"It is my opinion but not much sense, my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to transfer a third person to return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav Pelta, he will be the case for much of his election, that the FAR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral system to exclude from the outset. </seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly ease with a possible success of the Czech selection. </seg>

<seg id="77">Pelta had not realized election promised in September that he wanted in the case of his election to the national team and concentrate on the extraction of financial resources. </seg>
<seg id="78">It was decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last main meeting, and it might help him the two-month break, his ideas about the leadership of the football to defend and present in a broader context. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman is well known on Thursday." </seg>
<seg id="80">"He feels that it is high time that the association will be chaired by someone who believes the man, who is associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted on the Executive Committee. </seg>
<seg id="81">That is also why he thinks that he has enough experience to lead the Czech football. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that the current problems with the election euphoria is responsible at the time of Ivan Hašek reigned. </seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately, in the main assembly statutes approved in June, which were not as complete as everyone had assumed. </seg>
<seg id="84">If they do not allow different interpretations, we would have been a chairman from September," Pelta said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It is the revision of the most important document of the civil union he used as bait for the delegates. </seg>
<seg id="86">"If I become president, then I will accept myself, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work." </seg>
<seg id="87">"This is a fundamental issue, without which he cannot be," Pelta said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition, he is not trying to define his opponents. </seg>
<seg id="89">He had previously announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindich Rajchl, which he acknowledges, because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Tomáš Paclík attacked him for a long time, which, in turn, has left no dry thread at Pelta. </seg>
<seg id="91">In football, he has more than a year and can already point to some successes." </seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign." </seg>
<seg id="93">"This is also why many doubt its true nature," adressierte Pelta his opponent, who will remain faithful to its proclamations, which he has already expressed in September. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">In his opinion, his most powerful weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team. </seg>
<seg id="95">And this was supposed to be the flagship of Czech football. </seg>
<seg id="96">"I would also like to try to end all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the echoes of the corruption scandal last year." </seg>
<seg id="97">"Right after that, I would like to plunge into negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure adequate funding for all football," said TK sechsundvierzig year candidate two months ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At that time he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football would mean no human cleansing. </seg>
<seg id="99">"I would have been familiar with the content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk. </seg>
<seg id="101">"If you really ought to be the only contentious point, as we choose in the third round, then we will get over that." </seg>
<seg id="102">"The football needs credibility and he gets it back only if he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains, two days before the potentially decisive day of his career of officials optimistic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that the FAR from him to work hard begins </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the current deputy chairman Jindich Rajchl at the main meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood. </seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard. </seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to introduce systemic changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields. </seg>
<seg id="107">In addition, he promised to resolve the case Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As a chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole." </seg>
<seg id="109">Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national squad, the professional football, and football for young people." </seg>
<seg id="110">"So I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in the conversation for TK. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area." </seg>
<seg id="112">And I will be handing out tough tasks, so that the football in every segment is moving forward." </seg>
<seg id="113">Many were not exactly enchanted, because they, rather than simply to criticize the work of others, to work really hard should start," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the critical atmosphere in the football community was considered no longer to stand at all. </seg>
<seg id="115">"I know that I am working 20 hours a day." </seg>
<seg id="116">"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question," he said as an explanation for why he had hesitated. </seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do so." </seg>
<seg id="118">"This is confidence that we must not miss," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">It is alleged that motivated him, too, should be allowed to continue the work he has begun under Hašek. </seg>
<seg id="120">"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not now simply throw." </seg>
<seg id="121">"There have been trials started only in a few years to play out, and I would just like to see someone cut off," he said, and hereby expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in a systematic way and that is something which Mirek Pelta is not." </seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him, above all, people who make the football so that he only chosen because it would be." </seg>
<seg id="124">I think you can blame some, but not that I would be biased." </seg>
<seg id="125">"I am trying to be objective." </seg>
<seg id="126">"I want football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the chosen few," Rajchl said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic. </seg>
<seg id="128">"Even though some people say the opposite, I have really to do the best for Mähres." </seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to consider whether the league is not in a Czech and Moravian part should divide their winners each aufstiegen in the first league." </seg>
<seg id="130">"Then it could not happen today that only three Moravian clubs play in the league, especially for the young players in Moravia is a problem," Rajchl says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected. </seg>
<seg id="132">"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me to its deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl has led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations with the lottery law considers its success. </seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, it is partly the fault that the association was not in a single direction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While he says of Pelta, "he was disqualified from the outset to give the Czech football new confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate for the football really have something to offer. </seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job." </seg>
<seg id="136">"If he is elected, he would probably continue with the things that Ivan Hašek has begun, and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change." </seg>
<seg id="137">He would certainly not want to altered just on his behalf," Rajchl ruling on his rival. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Does the Deutsche Bank deal with agricultural commodities? </seg>
<seg id="5">According to online information, Josef Ackermann has asked a working group to examine the speculation for the poor of the world. </seg>
<seg id="6">In January the CEO's wants to draw conclusions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg. </seg>
<seg id="8">For the German citizen, the thing is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn. </seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world. </seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October. </seg>
<seg id="12">It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for world hunger problem. </seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against deutsche bank chief Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally intended for raw materials were betting that traders hedge against price fluctuations. </seg>
<seg id="15">But now, most experts agree that the Zocker has decoupled from supply and demand - and expense of the poor to make profits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Unlike the US-Konkurrents Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business was "worth the good reputation of the German bank to be put at risk." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information from ONLINE mirror an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch report. </seg>
<seg id="18">By the end of the year, the review is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of the Deutsche Bank - all recommendation, as it is to be handled. </seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what the consequences. </seg>
<seg id="20">In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann forge his image </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Foodwatch chief, Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks are hurting the common good." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann is a top bank lobbyist now especially in the duty. </seg>
<seg id="24">"The German bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," Bode said. </seg>
<seg id="25">"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann to hunger, suffering people or the reputation of the German bank." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture. </seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, the German bank announced that the head other than planned will not change in the supervisory board. </seg>
<seg id="28">In a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image. </seg>
<seg id="29">And he needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Any other commodity facilities would be terminated </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure high on the manager. </seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30 000 Internet users participated in the campaign of the organization. </seg>
<seg id="33">Bode on Tuesday published the survey, for which the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people. </seg>
<seg id="34">Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank, which will have bet on prices for food. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: every second, according to the survey would terminate all assets in which money is flowing into commodity speculation. </seg>
<seg id="36">43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold swings and new materials for the faith in technological progress are typical, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Charles Schwanzer of the Brussels World Expo is a good and famous example in 1958. </seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzers pavilion at the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy and steel glass design. </seg>
<seg id="8">The building is seen as a milestone to date of contemporary architecture. </seg>
<seg id="9">He made the architect so well known that at the next World Expo in Austria pavilion was built. </seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally famous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His temporary Ausstellungsbau planned pavilion at the World Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station converted and in 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20s home" has been called it. </seg>
<seg id="12">This was the building but neither physical and technical as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate. </seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, it has been used so long before contemporary art was a new house in Vienna. </seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art. </seg>
<seg id="16">On Tuesday night, the museum opened Belvedere, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The new start Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere. </seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco completed his Ph.D. art historian with remarkable career, among other things, in the youth as a Eiskunstläufererin, then with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the museum of modern Salzburg, strongly defended the reconstruction with politicians and Denkmalschützern, they get public funding and private sponsorship money and fixed use. </seg>
<seg id="19">Besides contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba will be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and there should be a bookshop, and a spacious house had to be built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, small budget </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The execution was the ideal person Krischanitz. </seg>
<seg id="22">It is not just because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive converted and enlarged and had won the competition, but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him an "enormously important place" was where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions. </seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the Ur-Entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung generosity and easily lost. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current restructuring, there have been far greater problems: the building was "a schleuder energy," Krischanitz says. </seg>
<seg id="25">The profils windows were replaced outside glass fibre verstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof is replaced by special security glass. </seg>
<seg id="26">Kältebrücken-Stahlträger are reinforced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been cleaned up. </seg>
<seg id="27">Two shells made room for the new use, a abgesenkter trench between home and road for the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still slightly Schwanzer-Pavillon. </seg>
<seg id="28">The original exterior doors are left, the house is removed in the old rotbraun Rostschutz-Farbton. </seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before. </seg>
<seg id="30">And this is all under strict supervision of the authority and with a small budget. </seg>
<seg id="31">"We often had to find a material that is good and cheap, and the Denkmalschutzamt did," Krischanitz says, and points to a raw soil should go. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the buildings remained flexible and easy. </seg>
<seg id="33">It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "the usual from Brussels," Krischanitz said recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte." </seg>
<seg id="34">Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "create a proper awareness." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the 21er house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: if the Swiss garden is completely new planned "main station home," with offices and homes. </seg>
<seg id="36">And maybe another stroke will occur: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-Bau, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and, as we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a good location in the Swiss garden. </seg>

<seg id="10">His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway is one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Buffett said that not even IBM previously knew anything about the commitment. </seg>
<seg id="12">He praised the management, even in the economic crisis had not yet provided for decent returns. </seg>
<seg id="13">"You have done a fantastic job," said Buffett, on the strategy. </seg>
<seg id="14">IBM has long been on the lucrative IT-Services such as the operation of computer centers. </seg>
<seg id="15">The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice, as well as powerful corporate computers. </seg>
<seg id="16">Buffett had more technology companies shunned until now. </seg>
<seg id="17">He says he will only invest in companies whose business he can understand. </seg>

<seg id="2">After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="3">One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now auflebe again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background. </seg>
<seg id="5">This news will be in Turkey and the Turkish people in Germany reacted with fear and concern. </seg>
<seg id="6">For many Turks, returns with a long totgeglaubt ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with right-wing extremist background against Turks. </seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question. </seg>
<seg id="8">The right-wing extremist network, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still far from predictable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"Is back on the bloody ideology?," the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "turk." </seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper 'Sabah', however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities might be involved in the far-right quagmire. </seg>
<seg id="11">Besonnen responded to the Turkish community in Germany: they remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence. </seg>
<seg id="12">Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement. </seg>
<seg id="13">The cooperation was orchestrated in gaudy colours - as a history of success. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">As a slap in the face, because the reporting by some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the murder. </seg>
<seg id="15">The German version of the 'Hürriyet' it is not thought to be linked. </seg>
<seg id="16">"It starts to stink," reads the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci. </seg>
<seg id="17">He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done. </seg>
<seg id="18">It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their discussion later success. </seg>
<seg id="19">Why the German authorities have not been invaded much more in extremist right-wing circles to search for suspects, the authors were surprised. </seg>
<seg id="20">Some shows at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "Will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces." </seg>
<seg id="21">"This will probably be the best protection." </seg>
<seg id="22">"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the ruine fire of Solingen is deeply embedded in German and Turkish memory. </seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed the Turks more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that mistrust and distance can lead to violence. </seg>
<seg id="26">However, the attacks schärften the sense on the Turkish side. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The mistakes of the past are not repeated </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press was particularly criticized the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl, refused to visit the survivors of Mölln. </seg>

<seg id="1">The Bank of Zürisee </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but also in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next. </seg>
<seg id="4">Now it is intended to send a German. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">For example, Axel Weber was not considered safe. </seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was reported in July that he 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: president of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was celebrating publicly praised the Swiss whether their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kind remarks about the future of my colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS has managed the Turnaround." </seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kaspar vill and Oswald Grübel." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different. </seg>
<seg id="11">A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and around EUR 1.7 billion verzockt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS-Vorstandschef Oswald Grübel, not only famous bankers in Switzerland, had to go. </seg>
<seg id="13">The same is true of the UBS board president also wounded since then - and all ask: when is finally Axel Weber? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">It became known that Weber, the Bank of February 2012. </seg>
<seg id="15">And the ratsvorsitz management will accept it already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Axel Weber will be tough. </seg>
<seg id="17">He is not a banker, economics professor and central banker, and would have had a einarbeitung time certainly needed. </seg>
<seg id="18">With a stroke he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just demonstrated once again that they have long been the title of "Europe's biggest bank deserves." </seg>
<seg id="19">On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next. </seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, is the Swiss bank once so proud. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis. </seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation. </seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the silent and sound, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they also wanted to have a very large number in investment banking. </seg>
<seg id="24">For example, the UBS managed with 1.6 trillion dollars in 2007, more money vermöge more customers than any other bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="25">And it was on the other hand, as investment bank advanced into the League of the world's largest banks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made sense. </seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker and subsequent long-running banking professor at Zurich Hans told me: "I have my students UBS was always portrayed as being a good bank." </seg>
<seg id="28">"From today's perspective, you wonder: how could I be wrong?" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was huge. </seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007, it was the first time it appears that something went wrong in the UBS. </seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned unexpectedly, until such time as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers. </seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, you guessed why he was gone. </seg>
<seg id="33">The investment division of the bank had been verzockt with sub-prime mortgage papers and had to write off billions. </seg>
<seg id="34">In order to cope with this, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs. </seg>
<seg id="35">There was real investors, however, some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft: an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so secretive that not even learned his name. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first blow. </seg>
<seg id="37">In April 2008, there have been worse. </seg>
<seg id="38">The bank has had to announce new billion losses, board president Marcel Ospel, in 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned. </seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state. </seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan, on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she saw how dramatic it is a small country when it is so big banks. </seg>
<seg id="42">After all, the assets of UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic display). </seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banking researcher says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster was the second. </seg>
<seg id="45">Even a few months surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with the United States and indicated it was prepared to release vermöge customers, who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank. </seg>
<seg id="46">They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars, and repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including criminal premium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">In doing so, the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion. </seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same. </seg>
<seg id="50">It was followed by the resignation of chief executive officer and board president. </seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of client money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">For example, the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios: investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just when it was a bit quiet again, just when you thought that UBS will now have to get back, because these unfortunate traders' story follows: an individual trader verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realises that something goes wrong. </seg>
<seg id="54">And it is obvious that the risk management works in investment banking, it is still not clear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the Adoboli case, we must note that risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="56">The financial chief of a large German bank is safe: "The problem of UBS is that they risk control is not in control." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was exactly the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time, the guardian of the great wealth of the world: not too great risks for safety for money - didn't want to collapse the world on the other side of the Alpine republic. </seg>
<seg id="58">The vaults of Swiss banks were the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the solid Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger. </seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic. </seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station from the Central Station from directly leads to the Zürichsee, the frames from the snow covered peaks of the Swiss mountains. </seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are magnificent, the rent is among the highest in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="63">Juweliere like Tiffany is taking place here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli. </seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries the Swiss banks: the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The reception room of UBS is breaking through a heavy revolving door. </seg>
<seg id="66">The walls are Drinnen marble dressed, thick leather chair, along with the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe." </seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer wants here: security. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank. </seg>
<seg id="69">His name he would not like to read in the newspaper, he is, after all, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks doing business. </seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS had become far too large, it is taking place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread. </seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss would have nothing more to say. </seg>
<seg id="72">"But if they have long since been adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, which changed the UBS, its first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution by the subprime jungle lost so much money as the Swiss bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible. </seg>
<seg id="75">"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition in the small seven million-dollar country the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "the UBS-Crash." </seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or about EUR 45 billion devoted to the politicians, in order to save the big bank standing before the bankruptcy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did it happen? </seg>
<seg id="78">When you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of UBS. </seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks, together with a huge corporation. </seg>
<seg id="80">It was a bank in the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew more and more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different banks, supplemented the UBS: a rich, but lazy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalisierte. </seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were favourable to much money with which they were able to turn a huge wheel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">There are two names with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the CEO's of UBS, Marcel Ospel, who was then chairman of the board of directors. </seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says researcher Hans. </seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, intellektuelle, modest, understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top." </seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel had left at the end to Wuffli. </seg>
<seg id="87">Wuffli was at the end probably made a crucial mistake: "He thought that his models are the reality," he says. </seg>
<seg id="88">"This is a tragic case." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">The tragedy, perhaps. </seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear that excess came before the case. </seg>
<seg id="91">UBS staff clearly remember the meetings at which CEO's Wuffli repeated the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone. </seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world. </seg>
<seg id="93">She led the "League Tables" in the rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time. </seg>
<seg id="94">This was going to UBS, according to the top. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps have already been achieved it. </seg>
<seg id="96">In the foreign exchange business and stock trading was very high. </seg>
<seg id="97">Business advisers, who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international business interest in the bank "Fixed Income," there is a huge gap on the largest banks. </seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that they almost claimed the existence. </seg>
<seg id="100">Hungrig for growth, both invested, the bank itself, as well as a confirmation of hedge funds in the US subprime assets. </seg>
<seg id="101">It became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage loans and verpackte - but also risks themselves. </seg>
<seg id="102">Even more than other banks have long sought the exit. </seg>
<seg id="103">"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was in flames, UBS has bought there," says banking analyst. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">This great euphoria, so deep in the case. </seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after the other had to go and clean up the trials more difficult than expected. </seg>
<seg id="106">UBS has been the weapon and are still shaky. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Anyone who now leads the Grand Bank, has an almost impossible job. </seg>
<seg id="108">He must find a strategy for a bank, all obvious business models are loss. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banking researcher has already an idea: stop the investment banking, concentrating on asset management, return to the Swiss roots. </seg>
<seg id="110">So far, the bank does not want to (yet). </seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment banking firm is expected to shrink, so much is already clear. </seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday to the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world about its future strategy. </seg>
<seg id="113">The 51 years old schweizer italo was only intended as an interim solution, as the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel. </seg>
<seg id="114">In the meantime he has asserted that he continued to lead the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank in the state in the 1990s. </seg>
<seg id="116">3 500 posts he points out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But this will not be enough. </seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision. </seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it? </seg>
<seg id="120">What they want to earn money? </seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber is safe now. </seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly he has so far only says he will begin an apartment with his wife in Zurich. </seg>
<seg id="123">Next year. </seg>

<seg id="1">Smart Krähen in cities </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In many places, Saatkrähen are seen as "problem birds," but from the cities the highly intelligent animals no longer drive a long time ago, experts say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Some people, they may want to get rid of the other very quickly: Krähen for centuries are part of the city, but in many communities there are mounting anwohner complaints about dirt and noise of the animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">It is a means to combat the "birds" have not yet in sight. </seg>
<seg id="5">Saatkrähen are no longer out of the cities, said experts at the first krähe symposium in ostfriesisch Leer. </seg>
<seg id="6">They consulted experts on possible ways out of the entire federal territory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They are looking for alternatives in the towns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Conservationists led the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the most protected krähes seed: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly vernichte the traditional habitats. </seg>
<seg id="9">The hunt, increasingly building and the cases of typical trees breeding birds made life difficult. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Krähen are under protection of nature. </seg>
<seg id="11">Large colonies with more than 600 breeding mate, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It was in 2005, a controversial project to the mass killing of Krähes in the district for negative publicity. </seg>
<seg id="13">Critics had the trapping of animals in wild birds and deployed with cudgels described as particularly brutal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, brings nothing," the city and schaft county planner Werner Klöver from Leer said. </seg>
<seg id="15">Nestboxes are wegspritzen with water or trees, often have unintended consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred Emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg. </seg>
<seg id="16">"The animals are made up of large colonies divide and spread to other areas." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, Altersheimen or schools. </seg>
<seg id="18">"We have to live with them, we will no longer be away from them." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without the surrounding area will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer. </seg>
<seg id="20">It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from sensitive residential areas and offered to resettle them in other places. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Information boards rather than chain saws," against the psychologist and Uta Maria Ethnologin Jürgens for an entirely different approach to the animals: "A Pickel in the face, we can best endure self-confident." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Jürgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the ash Krähen-Lehrpfad, which notices information about the lives of the highly intelligent seed krähes. </seg>
<seg id="23">The project will now have already been adopted by tourists. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In addition to the criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens own opinion: "There is plenty of communication that have a lot to say." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to come to a biscuit, but as a tool for its tool even itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Researchers at the University of Cambridge testing recently at four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds. </seg>
<seg id="27">In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must bring down with stones a structure so as to arrive at a motte larve. </seg>
<seg id="28">Without much training realized they determined the size and shape a stone platform to collapse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In a second attempt had the smart Krähes then solve a knifflig problem. </seg>
<seg id="30">In a hat, the researchers had placed a small eimer with a motte larve. </seg>
<seg id="31">The birds could not reach their prey. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">However, the researchers had them wire. </seg>
<seg id="33">This shaped all four animals a snag, with whose help they will be the eimer angelten at the top of the bag. </seg>
<seg id="34">Three of the four Saatkrähen were even at first. </seg>

<seg id="1">Mass slaughter on a personal level </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book, "beauty and horror: a History of the First World War, told in nineteen Schicksalen" with a long list of protagonists to heart. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Here is a tip, as you could do: cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers. </seg>
<seg id="4">They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these protagonists as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist. </seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature. </seg>
<seg id="7">He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of history." </seg>
<seg id="8">It contains only a few big names and big contracts or famous battles, and there are hardly any ambassadors, reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment. </seg>
<seg id="9">It is not so much a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is of "feelings, ideas, experiences and sentiments." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, drivers and office workers. </seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people are heroes. </seg>
<seg id="12">Some prisoners of war, lose limb will be crazy or die. </seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Englunds book differs from the usual history books. </seg>
<seg id="15">It also corrected the notion that the First World War had just been the devastating war on the West Front. </seg>
<seg id="16">"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa. </seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers are covered in this book baskets' celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen is an insoluble problem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is almost from the beginning of a very moving book. </seg>
<seg id="19">The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which smells like Kordit. </seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine that you are a woman who is home with their children, and cannon fire is heard in the distance, and I urge you, or you take the flight? </seg>
<seg id="21">Who is at all? </seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all. </seg>
<seg id="23">"There is a lack of facts," Englund says so, "guesswork, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories abound, dreams, aufgemöbelt Alpträumen and rumour." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard, a young German matrosen. </seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories were mainly memoirs, letters and other already published material. </seg>
<seg id="26">Your reports can be frightening or poignant, but they are very vivid in Englunds the details of verliere nden collection of small moments. </seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them act of omission and Behelfen. </seg>
<seg id="28">The story of a German schoolgirls told him: "Substitute, everywhere." </seg>
<seg id="29">"Kaffee, false aluminium, false gummi extremist groups, wooden buttons." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He tells us more about the dinner in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="31">He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes, which were besohlt with wood." </seg>
<seg id="32">There was, as he noted, "837 registered substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories act of honor and bravery. </seg>
<seg id="34">An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "We feel that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening newspaper or the bestselling book and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so, as a façade civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and besch were brust hemd." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and no one notice or will look into this. </seg>
<seg id="36">"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes. </seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations from the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror. </seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories." </seg>
<seg id="40">He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the Bestiarium of the new century," says: "The word and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the suit, the poor, while he sits behind a desk." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus. </seg>
<seg id="42">Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a venereal disease, in order to escape the frontline service. </seg>
<seg id="43">"The grotesque expression of what can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes. </seg>
<seg id="44">"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eyes, which meant that the rest of their lives were blind." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but decent and fits perfectly with its human task. </seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in a unique way, entfesselte uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred." </seg>
<seg id="47">The people are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books on the First World War were often more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Gallery Memory" or Romane such as Erich Maria Remarques "is nothing new in the West" as a comprehensive history books. </seg>
<seg id="49">Englunds band is an unconventional black hall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book is the most devastating of which I have ever read in a book. </seg>
<seg id="51">I admit that there is no longer. </seg>
<seg id="52">But it is, as he would have us with his book this side with the protagonists in the faces of weggeschnappt and lit with a match. </seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union, the hundreds of school managers, who last month lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The lawsuit is probably the last chance the union, county council 37, in their efforts to reverse the layoffs, is still open. </seg>
<seg id="4">Six hundred seventy-two school workers, child care coordinators and other staff members with the lowest paid employees of the city and were on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leader and political revenge have described that last year the city access to a health care fund, the working groups, had refused, with which the budgetary gap should be closed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities. </seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the council said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the last month, the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June. </seg>
<seg id="7">A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere had nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials from the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education before a complaint, and on Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education listed the city as defendants and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of whom are nonwhite or Latin American women, like most of the aid workers who have lost their jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft copy of the New York Times, the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools concentrated in the slums of the city, in order to support a complaint about unequal treatment; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers, because they are chronically underfunded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It lays down that, while there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in ville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With the loss of five of the eight school workers in the public school in Harlem, 36, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood betuchter parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P. S.: the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year was cut by 3,26 percent, but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any urban vine changed. </seg>

<seg id="1">The mission ended, Congress prepared to Libya </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington have to agree on the riots in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="3">Everything which was necessary to do so was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations decides the Senate a resolution, which the chairman, John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage" praises. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry. </seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the debate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or condemnation of the role of the US military in the Libyan mission of NATO. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain, a resolution which restricted the use of military force authorized by the United States in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="10">The law has been in the Senate rejected by a broad fringe of both parties, and there was no vote. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day, this bill in the Senate, the House also approved a decision to cut funding for US operations in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the US-Mission got into a kind of legislative fege fire - with a Congress that may have been angry enough, Obama's approach to criticise, within the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to him once the rug from under our feet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then there was the indecision of Congress overtaken by the events. </seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October. </seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now, the Senate may be ready to act. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya for their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, who support military operations to protect the people in Libya, for their exceptional courage and professionalism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Will the new measures the full support of the body responsible for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as did the Act of June? </seg>
<seg id="20">The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (indiana), the spitzen republikaner of the committee. </seg>
<seg id="21">Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has so far been the final version of the new law had not yet seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">According to Capitol Hill, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area in time to vote in the Senate or Congress. </seg>
<seg id="24">Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Lattes amendment is only one of 68 constitutional amendments, which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Some are double - the same law was also presented both the Congress and the Senate - while others differ only slightly. </seg>
<seg id="27">There are only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the haushaltsänderung compensation and a further dozen "federal spending under control." </seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they are such a measure "written." </seg>

<seg id="1">"Getroffen, but not defeated," Giffords in the first television interview after the attack </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Ten months after an armed man in the near distance during an election meeting in Tucson had shot at them, the republika woman was Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) Monday evening on national television, and they sang alone on the Broadway-Stück, "the Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to recover was greater than the return to the Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">When they, along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-Nachrichten "20/20," they struggled for words and needed help in walking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The programme showed the heavy slow recovery from the damage that the bullet that divided their Schädel, the left side of her brain drill and its head of crosses in front to the back, has done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Three months ago she unexpectedly returned to the Congress, triumphantly cast their vote on the debt cutbacks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In her first television interview after the attack in January in which six people were killed and 13 were injured, Gifford was smiling, laughed and sang - and described their recovery as "difficult." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford replied (41): "It is very good." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour "20/20" Specials, shortly before the publication of the new book by the couple was recorded: "Gabby: a story about courage and hope." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The Special pursued Giffords recovery since the attack on 8 January. </seg>
<seg id="10">In videos that Kelly had been recorded in the first few weeks, you can see it in the hospital bed, with bare lands shaved head and a long scarf on the cheek. </seg>
<seg id="11">It can only one or two fingers when her husband encouraged them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Months later, Giffords sits in a rolling chair, while therapists show how she carries out simple movements. </seg>
<seg id="13">A nodding in the head. </seg>
<seg id="14">A Zucken with the Germans. </seg>
<seg id="15">And then, her first words: "What." </seg>
<seg id="16">After a few days ago Giffords whispered another word: "Toast." you want to change their breakfast. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Videos, which took place in the ABC-Show show that music is an important role in Giffords ' recovery: you can see how the members of Congress, along with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna have Fun" and Tom Pettys "free Fallin" singing. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">In the interview with Sawyer said Giffords, who every day spent two hours with therapy, that she could not remember the day of the attack. </seg>
<seg id="19">Her husband said that Giffords on 12 March an article from a newspaper had read about the assassination when they interrupted him, and for the first time, asked about the six people who were killed during the attack. </seg>
<seg id="20">The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner sits in a prison in Missouri and forced medical treatment, while he was waiting for his trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Many people have died," Giffords told Sawyer. </seg>
<seg id="22">"Hart, tough, tough." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">In the course of the recovery of his wife, Kelly, told Sawyer, she said: "I was hit." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"So, I would say: 'Gabby, you got to be defeated?'," said Kelly. </seg>
<seg id="25">You just got to be taken. </seg>
<seg id="26">And you will be, and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed, saw the role of the troops in a different way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an Email. </seg>
<seg id="9">I am sure that the organizers have good intentions. </seg>
<seg id="10">I know that. </seg>
<seg id="11">But there was no respect, not really, but it was compassion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The troops are to be commended for their victims. </seg>
<seg id="14">But the praise has its price, members say. </seg>
<seg id="15">The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We were not victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="17">"But apparently is the only way of supporting those who are to put ourselves in the unfortunate souls." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who are not ungrateful or in dispute with the public, which they want to appear. </seg>
<seg id="19">They also have recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was far worse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">As a result talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans. </seg>
<seg id="21">After his two sons have returned from battles with the navy, warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="24">During his job search, he said he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle, whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding job in Washington. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">"If you speak about your service, you must keep the negative impressions about it," says Cancian his sons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in Americans' lack of interest in the war. </seg>
<seg id="27">Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely singled out as praise. </seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, an important hearing is to decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court. </seg>
<seg id="3">If it does not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a colleague. </seg>
<seg id="5">It was in October 2008, and she has just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when she met with a male colleague, a 12er pile of beer. </seg>
<seg id="6">He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room. </seg>
<seg id="7">"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said. </seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texanerin wischte put aside their concerns. </seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: ' Oh, what he is 19. </seg>
<seg id="10">He is from Texas," she said. </seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I would have listened to my gut feeling." </seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans room, the man behind her, put her down and raped her, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court. </seg>
<seg id="14">The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not oppose the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers are tackled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, convict or a proper administration of justice after the alleged attack to make them available. </seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says she has the top military leadership, because the problem begins there. </seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is hierarchical," she says. </seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals who are in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the leadership." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also says that since February nearly 400 other survivors contacted, many of them part of future complaints could be. </seg>
<seg id="20">Their strategy: instead that all claimants will lay their eggs in one basket, if necessary, they file many more lawsuits, in order to maintain the pressure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint. </seg>
<seg id="22">The files of the court, the week before, detailed defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations, which occurred in the armed forces. </seg>
<seg id="23">On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres-Doktrin, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff," the document says. </seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s. </seg>
<seg id="27">If women are still not allowed to serve in the fight, the distinction lies in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts. </seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in the war zones. </seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities. </seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the armed forces will be modernised, says Burke. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And it is in their fight not alone: three other lawsuits are pending. </seg>
<seg id="32">At the Yale Law School, is the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id="33">Collects small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America's a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them out of the service - a standard approach, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group. </seg>
<seg id="34">In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration (management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused at the service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws have been independent of each other by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties presented to the Congress, which will provide a series of clues. </seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense reported 3 158 sexual abuse. </seg>
<seg id="37">But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases per year. </seg>
<seg id="38">The report, which was published in March, also examines the legal trends: in 2010, 20% of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma. </seg>
<seg id="40">In Lymans case, they reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack. </seg>
<seg id="41">On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and Befehlshabern to tell. </seg>
<seg id="42">She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed. </seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex she had the assault with her friend. </seg>
<seg id="44">Six people said as a character in the name of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says. </seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought the labor would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom." </seg>
<seg id="47">"They brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his trial, and that was my trial." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiater, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent. </seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010, she was sacked dishonourable, so that it receives no support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether or not the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School. </seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward." </seg>
<seg id="52">As far as between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since, for the first time it has been called into question. </seg>
<seg id="53">I am a critic of the Feres-Doktrin. </seg>
<seg id="54">The military lags a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which entails a liability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: "The odds are against them... but it is important for them that they are trying to do." </seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change if good people are ready to fight. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with their hundreds of other plaintiffs start for future cases. </seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says. </seg>
<seg id="59">Or until we die, whatever happens as the first. </seg>

<seg id="1">The walls have eyes: how do you watch researchers on Facebook </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before he become the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik only one of many boys, their anti-einwanderungs online programs. </seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing before the court. </seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time until his attack on its computers and with some of the millions of gechattet by nationalists, the far-right groups on behalf of social support networks. </seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out about these people. </seg>
<seg id="6">But how will they be? </seg>
<seg id="7">This is easy - you just need to log on Facebook. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="9">Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years. </seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team found half a million supporters of extreme-right groups throughout Europe and then visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or a new dieting product Adds users invited to a survey in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment has been asked for their own future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10 000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties to consult in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their offices. </seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a fairly new research method," Bartlett says. </seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results come as no surprise; online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent immigration. </seg>
<seg id="14">But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists. </seg>
<seg id="16">Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes" texting and aktualisierungen status. </seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, on average three to add content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years to almost 800% increase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you could study people from this side, which is usually not met with his Clipboard on the street. </seg>
<seg id="19">"If you had previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them." </seg>
<seg id="20">"They first had to inform the party and they should never have been admitted," Bartlett says. </seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook is all away - you go directly to them." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the page offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems. </seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to drink than students who remained silent on this issue. </seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno suggests that same students, for example housing adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many aktualisierungen. </seg>
<seg id="25">"You cannot solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post. </seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, who would not have been found in a different way." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also constantly zapft the data of its own people. </seg>
<seg id="28">The data team has statistics on the status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (although data have been used primarily on the Facebook access only - champions digital freedom have known for a long time that their large data rich source for others should make available for research purposes. </seg>
<seg id="29">But users of Facebook know that they watched the side, whether or not they want it, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, Scrabble to play the part of the losses in their own personal data. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey of which they still do not even know anything? </seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted. </seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook. </seg>
<seg id="33">"As far as they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology. </seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest. </seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims made in a user profile, and in speeches are true. </seg>
<seg id="37">"What you say on Facebook and what you make outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selwyn says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">That is why Selwyn thinks, despite his years as technology researchers, that a Clipboard and a pen still are the best research tools, anyone can use. </seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says. </seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research must be concerned about the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline." </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="5">"I recognize the laws, but I am not guilty." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="6">Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views." </seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason he refused to Breivik, a mitbrachte in advance written permission at the end of the hearing to appeal to the families of his victims. </seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks remains in custody, he four weeks has no access to the media, and he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence will be closely monitored over eight weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims took part in the hearing. </seg>
<seg id="10">Some came in the hope that Breivik will be able to see in the eyes, while others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind bars and bars. </seg>
<seg id="11">They all took part with the aim that everything boils down to a Wegschließen. </seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor told Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK. </seg>
<seg id="13">"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard the suspects." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="14">Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and looked calm and professional during the entire hearing; he looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and left again. </seg>
<seg id="15">Despite the Breiviks bizarre suggestion that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices. </seg>
<seg id="16">It may have fallen to some that the attacks of 22 July was apparently the work of an individual extremists and not a group radicals. </seg>
<seg id="17">But that automatically makes it easier for the pain and confusion that still feels a whole nation? </seg>

<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of the mind," "a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series "triumph of the idiots" about the departure of staff Computers, and he served longer than an hour with jobs in which they are a rare, detailed discussions. </seg>
<seg id="6">At this stage than 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet. </seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in professional idiot, he says that the copy of the interview was missing in the delivery. </seg>
<seg id="8">It was only after jobs death, discovering a complete VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director. </seg>
<seg id="9">This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68 minutes film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies. </seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly thoughtful. </seg>
<seg id="12">In the course of the interview is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, clearly weighing his ideas and is striving for accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="13">There are also moments in which jobs ' perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient responded to Cringelys questions and anschubst, faster on issues or adverse actions of greater importance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer. </seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap of grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring. </seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things could and should. </seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after he had done everything he pulled off and made it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick look at seven noteworthy sequences of lost interviews: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As he learned to run a business: </seg>
<seg id="20">"During the entire years in business, I always ask: 'Why do you go?' and the answer always is:" oh, it is made easy. " </seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he does, but no one really thinks carefully about things. </seg>
<seg id="22">I have noticed that. </seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple. </seg>
<seg id="24">Struck, as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of business could be down to the smallest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As the Pope was veralbert: </seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs have been told of the "Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and TV talks could result in vain. </seg>
<seg id="27">The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, as the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious. </seg>
<seg id="28">He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T-Netzwerk in another, while so many satellites as possible. </seg>
<seg id="29">"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the phone, it came a minute later on the telephone next door," kichernd told Jobs. </seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we learned that we can build ourselves something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure on the whole world can control." </seg>
<seg id="31">We both, we did not know much, but we have been able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them Apple would be. </seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs have been told by a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box ringing in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger. </seg>
<seg id="33">Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he verliebte in technology (and called unprepared Bill Hewlett): </seg>
<seg id="35">In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he searched Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him. </seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob. </seg>
<seg id="37">"This has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the old age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff." </seg>
<seg id="38">Later jobs was one of the HP-Mitarbeiter, the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he was "the first Desktop-Computer ever saw." </seg>
<seg id="39">He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen and I verliebte myself in him. </seg>
<seg id="40">I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How innovation improves: </seg>
<seg id="42">On several occasions in the interview, Jobs speaks about how spontaneous to invent new products. </seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career, when he einbaute a few Platinen, he was asked by a customer to assemble them the whole computer. </seg>
<seg id="44">He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment. </seg>
<seg id="45">Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse: </seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember resounding arguments... you screamed that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost 300 Dollar] and I went out and found a manufacturer." </seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for 15. Dollar This was incredibly credible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">More than large companies: </seg>
<seg id="49">Long before Apple revival, saw the jobs on which so many industrial giants came in with their visions and lost control of their shares. </seg>
<seg id="50">"Let us say that you are working for IBM or Xerox, so you make a better Kopierer or printer, and na?" </seg>
<seg id="51">They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful. </seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product with which people are being squeezed out of the decisionmaking process. </seg>
<seg id="53">The production wizard, which has led to the monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handicraft art. </seg>
<seg id="54">This is what happened to Xerox... </seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry. </seg>
<seg id="56">It would have been 10 times greater that Microsoft would be in the 1990s... </seg>
<seg id="57">They have caught the defeat of the victory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Innovation as an art form: </seg>
<seg id="59">"There is plenty of craft between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, they change and grow." </seg>
<seg id="60">You learn a lot about his skill. </seg>
<seg id="61">You need votes, certain things you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories. </seg>
<seg id="62">It has 5 000 objects to see these concepts, and bring them all together.... </seg>
<seg id="63">Ultimately, it boils down to the taste, it is tantamount to saying that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to put these things together, which makes it possible. </seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal. </seg>
<seg id="65">We have always been shameless in the theft of grand ideas. </seg>
<seg id="66">Part of what Macintosh was wonderful was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world. </seg>
<seg id="67">Would it not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas. </seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas at opponents of health care legislation, as a court case </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day on which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question whether it is a challenge to the health care legislation will hear from President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner, which was gesponsort by the law firm that represented the case before the court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review. </seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 countries rose up against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which last year were approved by Congress, a law in conservative activists across the United States on the slogan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to the hearing; in fact, in March a 5 1/2 hour basic discussion is expected, probably the result will probably boost the presidential campaign of 2012, the date on which the court ruling will be announced in full swing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer, who stand trial and will claim that the law is to overturn, Paul Clement will probably be, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group devoted to the defense of conservative legal principles. </seg>
<seg id="8">Another company that the dinner has sponsored, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor, the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is a huge part in the outcome of the process. </seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner took place a few hours after the court had been discussing the case in a Washington hotel. </seg>
<seg id="11">Service, including Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years, the federalist society events. </seg>
<seg id="14">And that does not violate moral rules. </seg>
<seg id="15">In fact, judges freed from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the federal judge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they did, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in benefiz events because local and other organizations taking part, although the judge is not a spokesman, honorary guest or a host of such events." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nonetheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas, two of the case related firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This startling break with morality and contrary to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is of the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges and won dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with cases pending in court." </seg>
<seg id="20">Their appearance and their support for a donation campaign for this event to undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would issue judicial easily with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society. </seg>
<seg id="22">And Thomas ' Ginni wife is a well-known conservative activist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">By contrast, the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan is a moral issue, not Scalia and Thomas. </seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was chief prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legislative investigating appeals court came in the first instance. </seg>
<seg id="25">Their critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case to withdraw because of bias, because they are too much involved in the defence of the law was to be unbiased. </seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan does not need to do so. </seg>

<seg id="1">Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defence </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Defence Minister Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the war zones in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already making cuts in excess of 450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but fears that further cuts to 600 billion dollars or more will be needed if the Congress can reach no conclusion in the spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina. </seg>
<seg id="5">He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would result in 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless way that would make most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot three quarters of a ship or a building to buy - and other serious harm modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We also would be forced to take involuntary to separate a large part of our civilian personnel and, given that the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal." </seg>
<seg id="8">"These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our armed forces and seriously damage our preparedness." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts were eventually hit the combat forces," Panetta said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"While the war quotas in the anti-terror campaign are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned. </seg>
<seg id="11">"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support for the war." </seg>
<seg id="12">"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which will lead to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators responded Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the world's leading military power." </seg>
<seg id="15">"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published. </seg>
<seg id="16">"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us." </seg>
<seg id="17">"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United hurry up and whose commitment should not be allowed." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or step up demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, despite his many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference in the last week, the defence minister, painting a bleak picture, which could face a military shell, but without heart. </seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors." </seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without ammunition." </seg>

<seg id="1">As a lie revealed </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A glance at the current headlines shows how serious and widespread deception and lies in daily life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is dealing with the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both sides accuse each other of lying. </seg>
<seg id="4">The leadership of Penh State is accused of the President's, since it has allegedly withheld reports, according to which a retired football coach boy was sexually abused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the past week has been heard about an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US President Barack Obama claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lies destroy careers and shaking countries. </seg>
<seg id="7">The New York congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner was kidding when he brought Verleugnungs into circulation, which were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence. </seg>
<seg id="8">The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair. </seg>
<seg id="9">And then, of course, no one forgets that it has seen the media circus that President Bill Clinton has triggered when he during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky lied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread. </seg>
<seg id="11">There have been incidents in which teachers have laid down their student testing, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews dastanden. </seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and Schummeln. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deception we see? </seg>
<seg id="14">As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times. </seg>
<seg id="15">There are many, but these lies are lies. </seg>
<seg id="16">Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To detect lies, or "lie detection" is a learning is important for every person, and that both personal and professional reasons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far from being a social game such as, for example, in which it is the goal, "you!" is the Enttarnen of a deception, a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities, which had carried out extensive research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about which lies were revealed. </seg>
<seg id="20">Look in the eyes. </seg>
<seg id="21">You stottern, stammeln, suffused with and not always zappeln. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">As a result, we should not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat. </seg>
<seg id="23">A Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth by giving him something about the structure of the claim that the fine talk, learn about issues and timing. </seg>
<seg id="24">I have spent several years, the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing field of study in exposing, and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability, which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Good liars are very good to other people, to arouse their interest and to control their own emotions, and they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertiert people are more likely to lie than introverted men, that men are more often "driven" lying spin than women whose lies "to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies"). </seg>
<seg id="27">We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, while others feel less guilty, this person to have lied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">As you can see whether or not someone is lying? </seg>
<seg id="29">First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person. </seg>
<seg id="30">This is what is known as "Baselining," the starting position. </seg>
<seg id="31">It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes. </seg>
<seg id="32">Keep a close eye on the attitude, the smile, the quality of their participants. </seg>
<seg id="33">You should know better, when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot, so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviors. </seg>
<seg id="35">Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring, not as proof of a in exposing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People who are cheating might freeze when they try to remind themselves of their history, and perhaps their feet toward the door, or they are towards outcome, change their position on significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, diverting Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if they are all tough issues. </seg>
<seg id="37">Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a conversation has come to an end only after this relaxing to look for a job interview. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">You also pay attention to the language of your participants. </seg>
<seg id="39">The slip of Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Täuschende people can also use a distanzierend language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety. </seg>
<seg id="41">The most frequent verbal signs are subtle. </seg>
<seg id="42">Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer to a tricky question: "Well... in order to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of our knowledge and understanding." </seg>
<seg id="43">This is the answer rather than factual, which often set the alarm bells ringing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic cure for the Enttarnen of lies, but they can learn skills, thanks to whom one in exposing is possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">With these skills, everyone can rarely be the victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life. </seg>

<seg id="1">More controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised following threats by delayed US-Genehmigung </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to slow down in the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and environmentalists, reassured that the pipeline based company is trying to plan the project new, so that we can return to normal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area is being diverted to the sand hills of Nebraska. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The company announced the decision at a press conference in the parliament building in Nebraska. </seg>
<seg id="5">Alex Pourbax of canada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed, the area of sand hills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large water supply, meide. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, on Fox News. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The new environmental review, which the Foreign Office has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a function of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The 1700 mile pipeline in Canada was linked to the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="11">It would be 700 000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to pump the refineries in Texas. </seg>
<seg id="12">To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20 000 jobs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But the Nebraskas lawmakers, who oppose the plan, weigh up the laws, a departure from the region in the sand hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, to enforce. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief accountant of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One is whether a lobbyist, who was recruited by canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton was in a conflict of interest. </seg>
<seg id="17">The other is whether a company, which has been charged with carrying out the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is connected with canada. </seg>

<seg id="1">Climatic events bremsten the economy </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while the foreign investment fell and the economy stagnated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">In 2011, the Sinaloas economic history remain in my memory, and it is the first year in which Mario Lopez Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and great hopes in terms of economic growth, fueled by the government, however, due to the climatic events cannot talk about growth, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated. </seg>
<seg id="4">The low temperatures in February have not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but also the growth of the national economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3,6% this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent, the deterrent impact on other economic sectors. </seg>
<seg id="5">According to a from the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (the Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the frost, there were 582 000 hectares of agricultural land damaged, with 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, and it affected all of the vegetables, corn and kichererbsen crops. </seg>
<seg id="6">The decline in economic activity until November, in the Mexican state unemployment to rise steadily, and the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía were observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment, from January to March had 55 053 Sinaloas inhabitants no employment, which is 4,53 percent of the working population; in the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5,28 percent from July to September to 6,19 percent, which is about 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa to 18 969 people more than in the first quarter of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Less liquidity </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year goes back to several factors: the economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="9">"What we are seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, among other things with the loss of liquidity in the market due to the budget cuts by legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate dollars verboten, it is not easy to work for them to invest or otherwise use anything," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Migration stopped </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also inherent in a demographic factor. </seg>
<seg id="12">"The number of people the country to seek work abroad, particularly in the United States, is declining. This is due to travel problems, on one hand, and on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people stay here and looking for work, unemployment will rise," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Undeclared work </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system. </seg>
<seg id="15">With regard to unemployment and undeclared work the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Intergovernmental Authority for work and social care in Mexico). </seg>
<seg id="16">The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September amounted to 5352 pesos; that is very much less than the national average, which stands at 7375 pesos. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Decline in FDI </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">As well as the dismantling of economic activity and rising unemployment will be in 2011 the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, according to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June of 630 597 dollars, a loss of 87.74 percent compared to the 5,143,312 dollars in the same period in the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="19">The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for their part, recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The debt </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government requested in July at the National Assembly a loan in excess of 3 000,000 000 pesos to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 districts. The national congress approved a sum in excess of 200,600,000 pesos, but have until November no positive effects of debt on some of the economic sectors in the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Reactions </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">As for the representatives of the company schaft, the first year of government, Mario Lopez Valdés government default obvious. </seg>
<seg id="24">Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (the state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 is not an effort to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the national government, have been made. </seg>
<seg id="25">"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and in 2012 we must double our efforts and the efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already good government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Economic development </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the country's economic development and growth slowed. </seg>
<seg id="28">"The small business is the result of a number of events, including the frost, and one of the most important impact is a slowing economy, which is not enough to ignite an economic dynamism, a reasonable flow of processes, products and services could generate, and that is why we will be the year far below our expectations," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Redefine </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexican Employers' Association) in Sinaloa, said the state should be to encourage more dynamic productive activities. </seg>
<seg id="31">"In general, we have seen that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country, because it is important that all material and human resources to activate Sinaloas," he said. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="32">There is much to be done </seg>

<p>
<seg id="33">The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future, which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic bruchs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis that Italy has brought to the brink of economic bruchs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would meet to confirm the government building. </seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that a majority of the cabinet made up of technocrats, although it is still not clear when the new prime minister will take up his post. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I wish to express my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to cope with these difficult times," said the former Commissioner of the journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti has not explicitly confirmed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The "framework is now well established," he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, and meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis, the cost of debt has driven into an intolerable level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new government led by the former European Commissioner Monti should adopt a tough austerity package, which was demanded by the eurozone politicians to regain the shattered trust in Italy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The pressure to rush to Monti, compounded by the volatile market situation, following which the Italian government bonds for 10 years were burdened with 7% interest. This is in line with the state, in which Greece and Ireland have been forced to apply for the European rescue package. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, President of the Italian employers' association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government on all sides." </seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy can emerge from this emergency situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success to Monti's have been through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign because of the crisis on Saturday, increased substantially. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are designed to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed to a majority government consisting of technocrats, particularly the Monti. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support from Parliament </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unbeliebten austerity measures. </seg>
<seg id="20">Opposition to his efforts, or the delay of the reforms could again lead to a devastating attack on the financial markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure to Monti's was a disaster, is also under pressure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday with his discussions with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations. </seg>
<seg id="23">Tuesday evening, the round is supposed to be completed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who, as a response to the crisis an extremely rapid change of government has set in motion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After a brief revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, due to the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the cost of the Italian government bonds reached critical limits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A rescue of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current eu-rettung screen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said that his government had until the next elections, which is expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians give it time to implement the reforms will only be preferable to replace those elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to see politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedures imposed by the pressure of the financial markets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources point out that the mutual suspicion and disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from the complicated political life. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you, all these years to be on our side. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="31">Your your repertoire is never repeated. </seg>
<seg id="32">Why? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I think this is partly because we have nine Platten and more than 120 songs can play, and everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy. </seg>
<seg id="34">If we have two or three Songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they remember the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten. </seg>

<seg id="64">We were three years of a gang which until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had issued a record. </seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), the band returned with us, our friends, and when I hear a song or photographs can see, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he made me laugh, but it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and about music and football and many other issues. </seg>

<seg id="79">When I think about it, I think the tapes, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, sound garden, nirvana and all the others who were at the same time, if they are still important today, I find it wonderful, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and band like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before. </seg>

<seg id="81">Why? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem a bit frivolous, but there are also other songs such as The End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they have something positive. </seg>
<seg id="83">On both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed she played, and it is very dark Song's. </seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if you are older, and something drastic has happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two Song's embody the clear for me. </seg>
<seg id="85">But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music. </seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees agreed with the call for tenders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on 16 windows opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now lost Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure described the mountain as a vast park in Barcelona city. </seg>
<seg id="6">He was even in figures from the Central Park in New York. </seg>
<seg id="7">With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the upper limit of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is among the few who are not spreading in North and South, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea). </seg>
<seg id="8">The Collserolas classification as a natural park is playing with this idea. </seg>
<seg id="9">When the Image is now no longer the Central Park, but yellow stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs. </seg>
<seg id="10">So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access points to Collserola. </seg>
<seg id="11">No doubt it is a gateway to the concept of a park. </seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or someone has to make windows in the country. </seg>
<seg id="13">The question is: Collserola, park or mountain? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The tender is not only from the organizational perspective, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift. </seg>
<seg id="16">And it is precisely this fact provides the substance for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors, who have applied to the project. </seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved. </seg>
<seg id="19">"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach. </seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because it is accessible. </seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" windows of Collserola "an" intellectual case ": it must not be" as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas in which needs to be done. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that "a number of risks." </seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum "swan song." </seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is his own limits on what can be built. </seg>
<seg id="25">"Something always means to determine the next step," i.e. to exceed it. </seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to rethink urban planning instruments, because the present (with reference to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol, who is closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, the valle sana direction, "can be understood as a park in Barcelona direction," and for purely topographical reasons. </seg>
<seg id="28">Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment." </seg>
<seg id="29">He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says), ' we architects should only be a tool. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because the bidding conditions lacks a global view of Collserola: "It has been put out to tender in cross-section of 16 competitions," he says, "on the axis gebirge, but there is no längs perspective, which considers the territory in its entirety." </seg>
<seg id="31">This has resulted in his case, at least, that he participated in the 16 competitions. </seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway through which the architect of the clash. </seg>
<seg id="33">In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length as a soft transition between urban and green zones. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic, Hospital de Especialidades del Centro regions Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, pflegern health, nutrition specialists and social workers has been built. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Italian de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The public is invited to take part in the study, interested parties will be able to IMSS sports venues in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8am tests will be carried out with children and adolescents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) and began since the 8th October at the sports venue of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the federal state México) will continue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks) concluded. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="9">He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">They are also questions about their physical activity and their family vorgeschichte disease risk factors, diabetes or kidney failure could have meant to control. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, taille size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glukose level, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz Lopez stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years the percentage of obese boys to 77 per cent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," emphasized the specialist of the IMSS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% in the average indianisch American, to 30 per cent of European and African descent to 5 per cent, which is in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity, reflects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so this will be stored in a form of fat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The researchers said that the direct benefit to the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="20">All the information would be kept confidential and the parents notified in writing by the doctors, but the doctors tell the parents all measurements and propose changes to the lifestyle, which are appropriate for the prevention of diseases. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz Lopez said that there would be three basic factors for excess weight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: physical inactivity, which means a lack of movement on a daily basis, the most time of the day to spend before the television and use of transport to go on foot rather than short routes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckert beverages and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein, as well as genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project. </seg>

<seg id="1">Asphalt prevents leaks from the UNAM </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican university UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to mix more resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If the signs, which stem from the road surface, it would not be necessary, nearly 200 000 to repair the holes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban areas in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and gave assurances that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags proper, significantly reduced the number of bumps, or even completely avoided. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his presentation, "the revenues from a technical perspective," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing, producing a similar mix the asphalt, but a larger mechanical resistance both high and low temperatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera said that this kind of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road surface, thereby avoiding the appearance of bumps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene, and together they give the road surface his characteristic zähelastisches behavior. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Zähelastisches behavior in the asphalt means that this high temperatures of nearly 180 °C behaves like a liquid, 120 degrees is very liquid and 50 °C almost solid, while he is fragile at very low temperatures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"This means that the resilience of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but on a day in accordance with the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," led the chemical engineer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers observed the FQ, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible surface, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three asphalt dissidents. </seg>
<seg id="10">Between the upper classes is a wear layer of asphalt from small asphalt and stones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Every single stone of this wear layer is in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles to move and forces will be created, this section provides a good balance of power on the road surface. </seg>
<seg id="13">"If it is modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The wear layer," he " is being interpreted in a recent class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was also in asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="15">As this layer in contact with the car tyres, they need a larger mechanical force than the wear layer and they must produce friction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The road surface receives the most power and distributed, the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and the material from which they must be maintained. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather conditions, particularly humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, above all, the water, "he said," because it greatly affects the behaviour of the wear layer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the site is wet, water seeps into the class and is difficult, and this is causing a dilution of all sections of the road surface and as a result, the incidence of bumps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a hole is created, "he said," will initially cover layer worn out, while the wear layer only after that will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that the first signs of adequate maintenance programmes should be maintained. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexican national research system) said that the car of another important reason for the appearance of bumps, and it is therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the surface is always in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that the avoidance of frequent bumps will be complied with these rules. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research, for example, on Asphaltemulsionen, which in other countries are already on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without application of high temperatures could be repaired. </seg>

<seg id="3">El Valle gets its 14th title. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia. </seg>
<seg id="5">This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium, a silver head and the band, which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This night result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina is linked to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which the Crown had almost been kept in the hands, are among the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The big question many are asking today is: what was missing? </seg>
<seg id="8">The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any exhibition had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not for nothing that the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the königins beauty Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first Miss, is that the answer to the question, "what book has most influenced you and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, had not convinced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner: </seg>
<seg id="11">"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a way to be civilised, in the end, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, 'the little prince' is a very profound book. </seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment I read 'guilt and expiation within'; it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says 'passions'. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">One answer, which was met with little love, firstly because of the term 'civilised' and, secondly, because it had no concrete explanation of how each of her book had affected them. </seg>
<seg id="14">But after the ceremony, Melina said to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is, it happens, what must be done. </seg>
<seg id="15">And for all the people: please read a little bit of 'the little prince'; it is a great book. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is charred. </seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the special, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, popular vote on the best handgeschneiderte Kostüm and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously guarding the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it noted that in its first presentation wear swimsuits on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the krönung ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="19">Although it appeared in both safe, but it lacked the strength and the momentum of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "as en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the highest prices during the competition, but will not be queen." </seg>
<seg id="21">It also came to the end of the press - a mistake. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie about their interest in social work was not convincing, which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest. </seg>
<seg id="23">There is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"The beauty of a Miss Colombia alone is not enough; we must look beyond the physical and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found her in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The coach of a Queen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their numbers on the last day." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the surgery she had undergone. </seg>
<seg id="28">"The operations are lines, but Valle did not know how they do it right. </seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for this post." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the national beauty contest was conceived after the appearance in a grim prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come into the enjoyment of the crown. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">No matter whether it is true or not, in fact, that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the possibility of the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions. </seg>
<seg id="32">However, it is one of a Queen, which, despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, the crown was lost in history. </seg>

<seg id="5">Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González on-call, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings. </seg>

<seg id="10">Friday night he flew in helicopters from Palmira to Cauca. </seg>
<seg id="11">He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that a man who had guided the oldest Guerrilla in the world, and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz (his real name). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because it resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="15">Bewaffnet with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the abdruck page. </seg>
<seg id="16">He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano." </seg>

<seg id="24">We are taking fingerprints and searching for them in the database. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult, because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the criminals, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With the help of the fingerprints of murder suspects can also be discharged or contaminated. </seg>
<seg id="28">Recently, a dead was surrounded by crackpot bottles. </seg>
<seg id="29">During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle. </seg>
<seg id="30">Although it does not guarantee that the murderer, but he will be the place where the crime was committed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">A Daktyloskopist of the CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would be taken away from the object." </seg>
<seg id="32">If they appear to be a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage. </seg>
<seg id="33">After that, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or Personenstandamt. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to take the economy in an acid test, on the other hand, however, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee health reports. </seg>
<seg id="5">The first haushaltswirtschaftlichem goal: the government is aimed at the introduction of a fourth Karenztag before taking a health care speech to workers in the private sector. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In plain language this means that a sick worker without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of his monthly income. </seg>
<seg id="7">One measure, which, according to the newspaper "Les Echos," sparking anger threatens, however, would help to bring 280 million euros. </seg>
<seg id="8">And with a different measure more symbolic nature: the state officials to grant a unvergüteten Karenztag in sickness (so far there is for them, in Gegensatze on the three days of waiting in the private sector, no waiting period). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, these issues are in the discussion also cranked up the majority of new issues, and this time will be aimed at the abuses associated with working absenz. </seg>
<seg id="10">"Checks will be much more important, and they are also rückzuvergüten, if this is required," warned Javier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the field of health information is a little unproportioniert. </seg>
<seg id="12">This is, in fact, has already been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensive operations, which have borne the most fruit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are no longer more sick than people elsewhere in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">However, Verweilen first with the nationwide figures. </seg>
<seg id="15">According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, in 2006, more than EUR 237 million abfindungen paid. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the research and Documentation Institute of the health care system, the daily abfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros 5% of health spending. </seg>
<seg id="17">This figure fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as accidents and 54% on holidays, which means EUR 6.2 billion. </seg>
<seg id="18">And, therefore, 2,5% of health spending. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, the French compared with the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma consultation group averaged just 14.5 days allowed. </seg>
<seg id="20">An average, masks some differences: a different monster in 2007, the website for career planning, has been published, showed that 75% of the 40 000 French workers claimed to have taken a single Krankentag. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Another study covered by health insurance is clear that 37% of health coverage in 2010 of shorter duration than were 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than anywhere else on incapacity. </seg>
<seg id="23">One in 2010 by two researchers from the French national Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) conducted long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the global absenz ratio (the reduction or otherwise justified) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The fraud in health coverage represents a very small proportion in terms of undeclared work. </seg>
<seg id="25">With regard to the fraud only a weak level will be achieved here. </seg>
<seg id="26">The legislation since 2002 is that there are systmatische controls on health coverage exceeding 45 days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, the CNAM (public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million inspections found that 13% of the 285 000 of the short-term health coverage, which means in 37 050 cases, "unjustified or too long." </seg>
<seg id="28">When it comes to the systematic monitoring of patients to speak "cases of more than 45 days duration was 11%, from 1.2 million in" unangepaßt or unjustified " cases, which means 132 000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Overall, therefore, makes this 169 000 'unjustified' cases to several millions of workers who have been in force. </seg>
<seg id="30">One paragraph, which is only a small scale compared with, for example, those who represented the black economy. </seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP-Abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of a report published in July on this issue, it is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax cuts per year, i.e. more than the total cost of day-to-day expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in the latter. </seg>

<seg id="14">Now, however, there are, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or drug, no evidence that such abuses in their application, which is the practical implementation of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail. </seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, we meet considerably more cases of such violations, particularly in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference. </seg>

<seg id="18">Canadians support euthanasia </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let us remind ourselves that according to a reid angus carried out by the year 2010 poll showed 85% of Canadians had spoken in favour of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that it would allow these people at the end of their career to alleviate their suffering. </seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia was not meant to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people had less value. </seg>
<seg id="21">As for the people who have already done an assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted. </seg>

<seg id="24">The panel of experts calls for professionals in the health care system should be trained in the job, a possibility of making the funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear criminal prosecution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on linder treatment, the best palliative to make money, and this is also about the cancer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally, the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used funds for pain relief or final actions, at least to consider, because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the area of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of reporting be signed experts among others described as "extreme" as the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final phase set no limits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen a summary of the report. </seg>
<seg id="31">RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report was the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social knitted of society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Margaret Somerville, expert on health law, also has "a strong resistance" against the conclusions of the report, which they regard as "Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest" titulieren. </seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, doubts the reporting details about the Nichtvorliegens of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon. </seg>

<seg id="4">Availability and cost of electricity in a direct impact on the purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of enterprises. </seg>
<seg id="5">It is reasonable to hold an election for a reason, on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy. </seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will only bear fruit if the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are being explored. </seg>
<seg id="7">The French people should express their opinion on objective facts, make rational data. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Although 7 billion people on this planet are driving up the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, is not a huge proportion of the world's population to forgo a vital element. </seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we must alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget, in order to fight against climatic anomalies. </seg>
<seg id="10">The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters. </seg>
<seg id="11">That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power. </seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case in Belgium, which raises its decision on the need to find a replacement strings as an alternative source, in Switzerland, which intends to build the latest generation of nuclear power plants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few countries, are pursuing their projects against it will continue with determination. </seg>
<seg id="14">For its part, the United States have decided after Fukushima, their park another unit, making the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island are again in operation. </seg>
<seg id="15">Even if the renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, but contradicts the reality the discourse. </seg>
<seg id="16">The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices, the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants. </seg>
<seg id="17">The entirety of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection. </seg>
<seg id="19">Denmark is one European leader in wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are his CO2-Ausstösse, as well as its electricity price by 65% and 50% higher than the European average. </seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills. </seg>
<seg id="21">As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness, as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="22">Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would be a sharp increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion. </seg>
<seg id="23">Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people, and neither is willing to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 directly and create 410 000 jobs. </seg>
<seg id="25">Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs. </seg>
<seg id="26">If France decision to get out of nuclear power, it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more. </seg>
<seg id="27">What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the demise of its producers is inevitable? </seg>
<seg id="28">In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil is a panacea for the production of electricity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">The company Areva developed low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources. </seg>
<seg id="30">The highest possible safety standards to maintain nuclear power is an absolute imperative. </seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as, for example, is carrying out the construction in Flamanville. </seg>
<seg id="32">Their teams, who have made a name for their professionalism, are the security obsessed. </seg>
<seg id="33">In the space of 50 years, the three nuclear industry has experienced serious accidents. </seg>
<seg id="34">Only a single, and Three Mile Island, has been under normal operating conditions; it did so without any consequences for humans and the environment. </seg>
<seg id="35">Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human error. </seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters have caused an unprecedented scale, the deaths of several tens of thousands of people. </seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as well as after the two previous had done. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security forces of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible. </seg>
<seg id="39">Since the electric technikers is deemed desirable to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein, could be the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development. </seg>
<seg id="40">It is absolutely necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, as well as economic, social and financial situation of our country determined. </seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or an opportunity for the economy? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The immigration policy conducted under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many corners - overload of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures derived from politics, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had calls itself. </seg>
<seg id="3">More recently, the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities' side, the weekly schaus, the interior minister had in passing (see liberation from 23 May) announced that France "no talent, Maurer or waiters from abroad." </seg>
<seg id="4">But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Over this issue, there is a broad consensus between right and left. </seg>
<seg id="6">From the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900 people, including more than 2 million immigrierte workers, will pose no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not accept the overall poverty in the world." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the level of generosity </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers, in 2005, both from the right and the left. </seg>
<seg id="9">From both sides, the immigrants as a burden on the economy and the French society. </seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit. </seg>
<seg id="11">Francois Hollande is restricted in his programme to cliché, partnership development, it will allow us to solve "migratory problems." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can possibly have an impact on the elections, but it is economically costly. </seg>
<seg id="13">As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr. Cameron in a recent note, which summarises the latest evidence regarding the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped World and Will Define Future May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) that exists among the specialists a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration. </seg>
<seg id="14">The restrictions on immigration would weaken the growth and damage the labour market situation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by pressure exerted on their wages. </seg>
<seg id="16">However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job. </seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with labour supply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">We pay </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesists, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation. </seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flow of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0,6% and 0,9%. </seg>
<seg id="21">And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (a high proportion of eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants also contribute net to the social systems in European countries on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget. </seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany immigrating the public budget on average a net contribution of his life (revenue minus expenses) of 150 000 euros. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of intersection "with teeth." </seg>
<seg id="25">These teeth, which were intended to deter the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect. </seg>

<seg id="5">You know since Napoleon "small," that was a feature of the spirit. </seg>
<seg id="6">The general election law, the necessary condition of democracy is not sufficient condition and may well be "repression," as it was then the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said. </seg>
<seg id="7">No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation and control of forces, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and, above all, politics and democratic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="9">The change of heart of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums could have been doubly interesting character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit. </seg>
<seg id="10">This ambivalence should be seen as outdated. </seg>
<seg id="11">Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which, in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence. </seg>
<seg id="13">A free ticket for the European single ruler or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen. </seg>
<seg id="14">No, we want hacke lit, but a collective task, from right, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level. </seg>
<seg id="15">There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in fact, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="16">It is all over Europe, which is bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which is suffering under his powerlessness and his lack of solidarity. </seg>
<seg id="17">It is all over Europe, which is humiliated at international level. </seg>
<seg id="18">It is concerned about sovereign transfers towards Europe - it is all Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and so that every single one of its affiliated nations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The urgency is that the national sovereignty of the leadership of the European project. </seg>
<seg id="20">Because it is situated on the whole, whether the Europeans will reduce the burden of their debts, free from the markets and can introduce a future through investment. </seg>
<seg id="21">The exit from the crisis has made decisions at European level to the condition, which cannot be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to lead to destruction. </seg>
<seg id="22">After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time, it was about fighting, and now everyone is pushing the European economic governance. </seg>
<seg id="23">I agree. </seg>
<seg id="24">But this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed foolishness and another impasse. </seg>

<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory. </seg>
<seg id="11">The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed. </seg>
<seg id="12">The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas to Germany, avoiding any Trassenverlaufs with third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the land. </seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to Western European markets. </seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw, most closely involved in the debate, has not shied away from the North Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939. </seg>
<seg id="15">This means that the issue is politically very sensitive. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe has the backing of the Russian project won an even greater energy security. </seg>
<seg id="17">This, however, cost of starvation of European energy, because the project has caused a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans. </seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves are becoming exhausted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us together in organic way," said François Fillon at the opening of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the big Gasverträge are also important for political and economic side. </seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smile of the Lubmin many represented Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology. </seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth. </seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep. </seg>
<seg id="24">Its construction had evaded previous minefields from the Second World War. </seg>
<seg id="25">"Some hundreds of mines have had to be removed or destroyed for safety's sake," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream. </seg>
<seg id="26">We also had to step up measures taken to protect the fauna and flora. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The leadership is a long queue of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither outlets or maintenance stations. </seg>
<seg id="28">A monitoring platform was laid off the coast of Sweden, but the project developers have backed away from it, as the Swedes were not eager to a Russian civil society in a permanent way to settle their coasts. </seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Mr. Müller clarified. </seg>
<seg id="30">In the case of a leak, the hole in the gas pipeline gas in the air. </seg>
<seg id="31">This case comes from the designers, however, seen as unlikely as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100 000 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The state control of the gas pipeline will be both guaranteed by a Unterwasser-Roboter of external purposes is controlled by a Seeschiff, as well as by a device that circulates in the interior of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="33">It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre in diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and might move. </seg>
<seg id="34">After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of three meters per second, provides the device in his arrival the most accurate information about possible Deformations of the metal. </seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair. </seg>
<seg id="36">The Gaszirkulation is quite simply guaranteed by pressure. </seg>
<seg id="37">This is more than 200 cash for access to 100 cash at the exit point. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have combined their efforts to implement this project. </seg>
<seg id="39">The administration, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares. </seg>
<seg id="40">Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF affiliated (15,5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (9%). </seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline. </seg>
<seg id="42">It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax system is particularly favourable. </seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract. </seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how large the real volume may be transported," clarified Mr. Müller. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the baus gas pipeline was 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans. </seg>
<seg id="46">The total labour costs should be 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million. </seg>
<seg id="48">However, the minority shareholders are likely to recoup their expenses, since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline is a gritty, Kiefers forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea. </seg>
<seg id="50">The 4.5 metres high values are the Gasaustrittspforte. </seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines. </seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour. </seg>
<seg id="53">This would be in full capacity of 3 million cubic metres per hour, as well as 6 million in 2012. </seg>

<seg id="1">Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers at such a high level? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Roughly 19% of disabled people are searching for a job. </seg>
<seg id="3">Today begins the 15th week of work for the disabled." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In spite of an ambitious public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people has always been twice as high as the average value: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population. </seg>
<seg id="5">Entmutigend? </seg>
<seg id="6">"No, said Éric Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled. " </seg>
<seg id="7">"The fifteen years of progress are substantial." </seg>
<seg id="8">"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times as high." </seg>
<seg id="9">"Nevertheless, a great deal still remains to be done." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said, however, that many obstacles remain for disabled people remain before they get a job. </seg>
<seg id="11">More often, it affects the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average). </seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a baccalaureate, and there are only 10 000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students in higher education. </seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled people, compared with 38% of the total average. </seg>
<seg id="14">In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new job, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, director-general of Tremplin, an association in 1992 founded the company helps recruit disabled workers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the factual checks. </seg>
<seg id="16">If the underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly develop. </seg>
<seg id="17">In April, from the Association of IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La cite survey, which polled managers have "a weak level of knowledge about the disabled," the "overrepresented" was "of people in rolling chairs, mental or intellectual bemittelten." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987. </seg>
<seg id="19">The latter, from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2,6%. </seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now at about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law. </seg>
<seg id="21">The proof is that the number of "charges" plants, as well as the amount of paid sums between 2007 and 2011 has been reduced, and numbers from 59 000 to 46 000 (and 606 to 480 million euros). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The Act of 2005, which provides for tax increases, has created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc." </seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement is also a real awareness, especially among the large corporate groups." </seg>
<seg id="24">According to the ministry for work only 59% of sites between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%. </seg>
