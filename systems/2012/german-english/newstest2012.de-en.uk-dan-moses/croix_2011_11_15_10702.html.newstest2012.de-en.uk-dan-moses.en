Nord Stream, new gateway to russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe directly with Russia, has been in operation.
You should gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Russia 's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to this event with pomp and circumstance.
More than 500 geladene guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung Feinschmeckerbuffet and in the opening of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, Russia and Germany below sea level.
German Chancellor Merkel Angelika, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolischerweise together the tax the Ventils, which the russian gas to western european network.
With the new gas pipeline to additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of russian gas a year by the first pipeline of 1.224 km to the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg - western Pomerania, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which is a Gesamtlieferung of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the french total consumption - allowed, to the end of 2012 will be completed.
And it has the possibility of the construction of a third line of which led to themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge Bauwerkes as a victory.
The project has been in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested.
The Nord Stream pipeline is a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in preventing any Trassenverlaufs through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.
For that reason, these two countries a little of their power: for them, it is now more difficult to put pressure on Russia, by threatening to gain access to western european markets, to close down.
Warsaw, most in the debate, was not to be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a “ new german - sowietischen pact ” in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.
Western Europe has to support this russian project an even higher security of supply.
But at the expense of starvation of a european energy, because the project is blazing a trail between West and East Europeans.
Russia has it in barely five years ago, to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out.
“ This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, organic way links, ” François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out, to what extent the groβen Gasverträge, also of political and economic is important.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom 's managers about the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of the pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The Unterwasserleitung is made from steel with Betonummantelung before Schiffsankern to protect.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, in about 200 metres deep.
In its construction had from the Second World War previous minefields to be tackled.
“ Around hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution, ” Jens Müller, the spokesman for the society Nord Stream.
Auβerdem had increased Maβnahmen for the Protection of flora and fauna.
The line is a long line of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme over the entire length of nothing is interrupted: “ neither outlets, still Wartungsstationen.
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project have refrained from taking, as the little Sweden were eager, a russian public company on permanent way to settle their coasts.
“ In the event of an accident we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute, ” stated Mr Müller.
In the event of a leak in the pipeline leaks out of the gas in the air.
This case is of designers, however, is likely to be seen as a little, since the Schweiβnähte on consistency of a leak per 100,000 years been estimated.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline, both by a robot submarine, the external Observationszwecken by a Seeschiff from is managed, as well as by a device, in the heart of the pipeline is circulating.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, is in the heart of the pipeline and gas pressure by the move.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when they arrive very specific information about possible deformations in the metal.
The pipeline was designed to 50 years to work, without the slightest repairs will be subjected to.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This 200 cash to the access - 100 cash to the Austrittsstelle.
Five companies have to implement this project their forces.
The Leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, the 51% of the shares.
Still, it is the german companies E. ON and BASF attached to the (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the french Firmengruppe GDF Suez (ever to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is especially effective.
Gazprom has this society, then the whole of the capacity of their Gastransportes rents out, on renewable twenty - year agreements.
“ Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how groβ from transporting the quantity of gas is real, ” stated Mr Müller.
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus was to 30% to 70% of shareholders and by bank loans.
The total labour costs should be to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders, however, gewiβ, their expenses to recoup, with Gazprom alone the liability.
The pipeline is on a sandy, with Kiefern forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 - meter - high outlets are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measure, temperature, pressure and other indicators of the gas, arriving before this in the german gas pipelines will be passed.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal with a million cubic metres of russian gas supplies verstreichende per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
