Why is the unemployment rate of disabled people in such a high level?
About 19% of people with disabilities are to find a job.
Today marks the start of the “ 15. week of work for disabled. ”
Despite a purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is for disabled people always twice as high as the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population of unemployment.
Discouraging?
“ No, it stressed Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the “ week of work for disabled ”. ”
“ In 15 years of progress. ”
“ At the time, it was the unemployment rate, not twice, but three times as high. ”
“ Nichtsdestotrotz remains enormous amount of work to be done. ”
It has to be said, however, that the unemployed for disabled many obstacles remain before they get a job.
It is more often the elderly: 37% are over the age of 50 years (17% on average).
You have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no a - levels and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities in the 2.3 million students with qualifications.
In the end, the very long - term unemployment widespread: 53% for the disabled to 38% in Gesamtschnitt.
In short, there are so many criteria that a renewed Arbeitseinstieg more difficult, and the “ heart of the problem lies, ” Christian Grapin, Director - General of Tremplin, a 1992 association set up companies to help disabled workers to recruit.
So much for the factual brakes.
The left unsaid, the mindsets, certainly, but slowly develop.
A in April from the Association of IMS - Entreprendre for the journal La Cité study of the managers surveyed have “ a weak Kenntnisniveau on disabled, ” the “ over - represented ” is “ for people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually off. ”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the Anstellungsziel of 6% disabled workers, which by law in 1987, has been established.
The latter, which dates back to 2008, figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
“ We are now in the 3%, ” said Pierre Blanc, Director - General of Agefiph, the organization that is entrusted to collect contributions from companies that this law.
The evidence: the number “ charges zahlender ” sites, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and although zahlenmäβig of 59.000 on 000 (and of 606 to 480 million euros).
“ The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses, said Pierre Blanc. ”
“ But this improvement also brings a real recognition, especially at the groβen Firmengruppen. ”
According to the Ministry of work only 59% of the sites between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
