Intelligent Krähen broad in cities from
In many places, Saatkrähen as “ Problemvögel ”: but in the cities, the highly intelligent animals no longer drive, say experts.
The one they may be, the other, they want to get rid of very quickly: Krähen belong to the erased from for centuries, but in many local authorities are more frequent Anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a remedy for the “ Problemvögel ” has so far not in sight.
Saatkrähen are from the cities not to get out more, experts said the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen Leer.
There we consulted experts from the entire Bundesgebiet on possible ways out.

Conservationists have led the problems in towns and cities to the exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen back: the Chemieeinsatz in agriculture destroying increasingly the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing building and the cases of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds.
Krähen are under nature conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren there is, among other things, in the westphalian Soest in the north - west, among other things, and Jever Diepholz Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project to mass killing of Krähen in the district for Negativ - headlines.
Critics had the trapping the animals in Vogelfallen and Erschlagen with clubs as particularly brutal.
“ The normal displacement, the Vergrämen, nothing, ” the town and Landschaftsplaner Werner Klöver from Leer said.
Nests with water wegspritzen or trees, often have undesirable consequences, also said the emperor from an expert on Manfred Lahr in Baden - Württemberg.
“ The animals from soft, large colonies split on and is spread to other areas. ”
Vergrämung is just as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
“ We have to live with them, we will get them away. ”
Without the surrounding area will solve the problem in the cities not resolve, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen the animals from the sensitive Wohnbereichen and misleading them in other places again.
“ Instead of chain saws Infotafeln ” campaigning against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals: “ in the face of a Pickel, we can finally best self - confident. ”
Jürgens had in Schleswig - Holstein the Ascheberger Krähen - Lehrpfad co - founded, in the notices about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen information.
The project will now have already adopted by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds had Jürgens think: “ there is a lot of communication, which have a lot to say. ”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen use not only tool to in a biscuit, but, as their tools even itself.
Animal behaviorists Cambridge University tested recently four Saatkrähen, how far the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment, the birds learned quickly that it with stones, a structure to overthrow, in order to a Mottenlarve.
Without a lot of training they realized single - mindedness, the size and shape of a stone must have the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the smart Krähen then kniffligeres a problem to solve.
In a vertical cylinders, the researchers set up a small buckets with a Mottenlarve placement.
With the Schnabel, the birds do not achieve their prey.
However, the researchers Drahtstücke them off.
It was formed between all four animals a catch to help them the buckets on grip from the bag angelten.
Three of the four Saatkrähen manage even right away.
