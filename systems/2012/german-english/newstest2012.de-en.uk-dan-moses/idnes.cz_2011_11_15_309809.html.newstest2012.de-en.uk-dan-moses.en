More than a third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9% of all pupils and 5% of all children are overweight.
Recent opinion polls - obese children come mostly from families with ungesundem lifestyle.
So once again, how important it is for the development of a healthy people the milieu in which it grows up and the examples that surrounded him.
On the tables adipöser children sausages up to half of more often on the table than in families in which normalgewichtige children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children, on the eve of the Aufklärungsaktion under the slogan “ obesity is not a coincidence ” for chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen include sport is not just to the Lieblingsbeschäftigungen, but also the majority of today 's students, only 15 percent said that their parents are at least once a week on time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey found last year against the end of the academic year, were almost 900 children from schools across the Czech Republic.
This was the second year the action “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” by the general insurance company and the society Unilever is supported.

Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors for the alarming increase in the number of children with obesity or even obesity are responsible.

No breakfast and the sausages for dinner
Experts point out that relative small things, such as the regular Frühstückszeit the family, important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic frühstücken but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families breakfast alone.
The worst was the fact that in every tenth family is not eating any breakfast.
Breakfast is the foundation stone of the day - to - day healthy diet.
The Umfragetest brought to, among other things, the day that the families of overweight children more frequently to unhealthy chips consumed.
And nearly everyone, with no regard to weight - drink every day sweetened soft drinks (70%)
While driving more than 40 per cent of children sport, but fewer than half of their parents are doing this - just 15 percent.
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the poll, made it possible for selected children (204 boys and girls from 172 13 schools), from opportunities offered after appetites and believe their own menu together.
“ What czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a long way from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many Mehlspeisen Fleischgerichte, and, of course, Süßspeisen.

At lunch, the main course, triumphed pasta just before poultry.
Pulses, liked the children almost not at all and the popularity of fish and Gemüsegerichten as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr on health
At the same time, the survey showed, however, that the children are willing to change their eating habits, if it is right for information.
“ In the control group of the Umfragebeteiligten, the questionnaire following the conclusion of the aufklärenden lecture “ obesity is not a coincidence, ” filling out was, in many cases, a significant shift preferences to principles of healthy eating there, ” is in the results of the project.
For example, this was evident in the sweet Limos, where many children began to ordinary water to give priority.
The children crossed in the questionnaire, more often chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were prepared to less dumpling or sweet food to eat.
