21er House in Vienna
The pavilion umgezogene
By Mrs Wiensowski
A Architekturgeschichte highs, lows and happy endings — the austrian Weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels in 1958, was won by prices in Vienna for the museum, was empty and verkam.
It is now as Ausstellungshaus re - opened.
If of modern post geschwärmt will clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, the typical of the belief in the technological progress, then the austrian pavilion of the architects of Karl Schwanzer for Brussels' World Expo in 1958 and famous is a good example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Grand Prix d 'Architecture for his easy and float - looking - glass - steel construction.
The building has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so well known that the and at the next World Expo austrian pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was in 1973, after all, internationally renowned.
His Ausstellungsbau planned as a temporary pavilion had been following the exhibition in the swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof established in 1962, and converted to a museum of the 20th century - opened the 1920s “ House ” it was called.
Lift the building but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
It was, however, so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion rebuilt, he is now “ 21er House ” and will, in the future, as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday night the Belvedere museum, which the House, where the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in every respect.
Won the restart Agnes Husslein - Arco, 2007, the new director of the austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein - Arco, qualified art historian, with considerable career including the young people as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby 's, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of the modern era than Gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern by, they provided public funds and private Sponsorengelder and established the use.
Except Gegenwartskunst should the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba of the eponymous Foundation issued a café and a bookshop, and it should be a Bürohaus had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the operation was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work.
Not only because it Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive converted and extended and won the competition, but also because he is in Schwanzer in the technical Vienna University and has studied the pavilion for him a “ incredibly important ” was the ground when he felt “ almost every weekend, ” the exhibitions considered.
He knew the Ur - draft, and he was very familiar with the problems of the building, which at its transfer to Vienna and its Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
At this restructuring, there was far greater problems: the building was “ a Energieschleuder, ” says Krischanitz.
The Fensterprofile the outside glass of have changed, glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas set up and the Glasdach by special security glass.
Kältebrücken - damaged are more or been replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been refurbished.
Two Untergeschosse made room for the new use, a abgesenkter Lichtgraben between House and road will ensure the Belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer - pavilion.
The original Außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz - Farbton removed.
And the theatre is even more closely as it used to be.
All under strict supervision of Denkmalbehörde and with a small budget.
“ Often had a material are found, it is good and proper, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked, ” says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss.
Despite all the pressures, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy.
It is difficult, with the pavilion, “ the came from Brussels, ” Krischanitz recently said that a typical “ rates - in - the - City - history. ”
So a architecture is “ always in the wrong place ” and wanted to give a proper still “ awareness ”.
In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is a stroke of urban happened: the swiss garden is emerging around the entirely new planned “ Hauptbahnhofsquartier ”, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may be happen: the 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz - construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary Kunsthalle bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city for a neighbourly location within the swiss garden.
