The general meeting to find a new chairman - again threatened a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and there is that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Football Association (Czech FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know.
To this day, there are still no agreement on the electoral law would be elected.
And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successor.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek of his role, and his colleagues in the departure of inviting had come to an agreement and a strong person to find the football to follow.
Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old spat between the two Verbandskammern once again, which is not on a joint candidate can agree.
This was clearly on September 16, as the new chairman should be chosen.
The delegates to the general meeting were free of the Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who in the Vollsammlung actually vote - are only the statutory representatives or with a power - wielding officials.
In this one point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in Vollmachtbasis not admissible.
The disputes in the electoral law, however, continue to take in.
The executive committee did not have more clarity on the issue, in whose meetings - regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the ideas about the choice of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: how can we in the third round, a stalemate to avoid?
“ The bone of contention is the question of whether it is in line with the statutes of action, or whether a very different model must be found, ” said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice - chairman of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round one candidate, the greater the prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is said to be ready to compromise on that one candidate wins out, the higher the number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Republic, in turn, is on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count at least a two - thirds majority.
“ Then, the two Vorrunden make no sense, this way, all the Zweikammerkonzept in question, ” Svoboda understands the objections of the moravian side, the best there is, the electoral law not tweaking, but under current statutes to choose.
The true surprisingly Tomáš Paclík to, even if it is apparent that the statutory election rules of all the candidates most likely to be Pelta meet.
“ My wish is that as far as possible after the statute is elected. ”
“ So that no nonsensical Ersatzvarianten up, as in the last general meeting, ” said the owner of the Victoria (clubs) Plzeň which, for the first time, standing in his opinions and, above all, to Pelta abgrenzte.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, will be in the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidates in the future will work constructively.
“ The possible qualifications of the national team for the Euro today would be sure to reassure the people. ”
“ If the football until the euphoric wave ride, it is also the willingness to cooperate more, ” said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience and both at professional, and regional level.
Rajchl there is more circumspect.
“ I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent. ”
“ It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules to witness the “ baseline ”. ”
“ That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded. ”
“ I hope, however, that the common sense prevails in the end, ” said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is not.
Some negotiations must be supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification at all will be completely.
The Charterflugzeug, amongst other things and Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice fly should, in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder do not start and so it sought urgently for a Ersatzvariante, as a part of the executive committee, but are still on the site of the Barrage - Hinspiels.
At the end of the day, then surely the meeting at ministerial level is essential to the supposedly it on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands the country would like to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: benefits of the Czech Vertrauungswürdigkeit football and the forthcoming general meeting of the czech ČSTV, the sport after the financial problems of Sazka 's new direction.
Paclík is in the fight for the position of the chairman, because it is not a suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting of a strong candidate would have picked up, all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) met, he would do not relate to the fight for this position of concessions.
“ When there is a good candidate, then I would strive for it and to the election. ”
“ But in the current situation, we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find, ” said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík, into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, that the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the function of the chairman of just one year plans to exercise, so until 2013, until the date of the ordinary shareholders' meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in the Fußballgeschehen is involved.
“ With some eligible people in person. ”
“ Hard to believe that some people have said that they want to do is not currently with the czech football.
“ Those views would like to have changed, ” he said.
Most of all, disturbs Paclík supposedly Pelta 's link with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands Berbr novel, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind - the - scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to Delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings to influence.
For Paclík is, therefore, that it is unacceptable that Pelta, held the position of the chairman.
“ In his victory would today 's state einkonserviert and in the czech football is not making any progress at all. ”
“ The support provided by Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, football twice badly, ” said Paclík.
Now he is also essential that Pelta 's name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen to identify in a Korruptionsaffaire fell from the Pelta, however, emerged with impunity.
“ I do not know what the prestige of a victory by the Pelta (tsch.) football should get involved. ”
“ And as we would in the eyes of the FIFA and UEFA off, ” said řekl Paclík, his former utterance, “ he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will ”, but something more coolly.
In the Donnerstagwahl Paclík should win, he would, however, be a future cooperation with Pelta quite imagine.
Just as thinks another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the General Assembly in October had supported with a fiasco.
“ He (Pelta) would be the first, on which I would go. ”
“ He has great ability. ”
“ I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team. ”
“ But I do not think that it is capable of, the association as a manager. ”
“ I caught my nose but not in issues that I do not understand, ” said Paclík in September that raised eyebrows – that he was behind the dismissing the Schiedsrichterkommission with Luďěk Macela at the top, was the Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the Verbandsvorsitzenden increased.
And holding up his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen which, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league.
“ I have the power to do so, something in the Fußballmilieu to change and to a certain degree of cultivation of this. ”
“ In order to limit the influence of interest groups, which tend to disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen to influence what by in - bound descends into situations, ” led to the Paclík, no secret of his antipathy, for example, to the Sparta 's leader, Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the czech Olympic Committee, with the help of the political leaders to live that more money from Lotteriesteuer in the sport.
“ This is one of the key things, to which the new chairman should pay attention to. ”
“ If it on the taxation of Glückspielen, as the political parties declare, then I understand their argument, but there must be clear where the money is going, ” he said.
His connection to the club Paclík Pilsner is also not a handicap in, even though he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR need to “ bipartisan ”.
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec Rajchl, with the Prague Dukla.
“ This is not ideal. ”
“ It makes my opinion but also not much point in my shares in the club to a Drittperson Pilsner hypocritical to after a year and a half back again, ” said the Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, the stalemate in future ausschlössen.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt Miroslav Pelta, namely that he would do in the event of his election campaign for the new statutes FAČR gets in the future disputes over the electoral law, rule out.
The official from Jablonec is before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in the event of success of the Czech selection sure.
Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided at the last moment, in the election before the last general meeting to participate in the two - month pause it might help to put his ideas on the leadership of the football to defend and in a wider context.
“ People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the president on Thursday is known. ”
“ He feels that it is high time that the Association of someone who is headed, says the man who, in particular, with the club Jablonecer is linked, but also many years in Sparta, and in the executive committee.
Also, he has said that it has sufficient experience, the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria is responsible, in the days of Ivan Hašek.
“ Unfortunately, in the shareholders' meeting in June approved statutes, which do not fully, as it had all assumed.
If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we should have, as of September, already had a chairman, ” Pelta said.
The review of the most important document of the residents' association he used as a sweetener to the delegates.
“ I should be president, then I will accept the me personally and I am personally prepared to take responsibility if it does not work. ”
“ It is a matter of principle, without which it can be, ” Pelta said.
In addition, he did not try to stand up to his opponent.
Earlier, he had announced that he can work with Jindřich Rajchl imagine, because of his legal education recognises and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík, it has been for a long time, which, in turn, no dry thread to Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already in some successes. ”
“ His attacks were herabsetzend, however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign. ”
“ Also doubt now many of his true nature, ” Pelta addressed his opponent, the most faithful to his proclamations remain, for which it has in September.
In his view, the most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the hallmark of Czech football.
“ I would try to do all Affairen to end - of fog Bohemians, up to the Nachhallen the Korruptionsskandals last year. ”
“ Afterwards I on negotiations with the private and public sector to sufficient funding for the whole of football ”, said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football no human cleansing would mean.
“ I would have to start with the monitor all workers get to know, ” he said in the direction of Strahov, where due to the length of the anarchy understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which the General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain.
“ If there is really the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we will get over that. ”
“ The football needs credibility and that wins it will only back when he finally has a new Leader ” Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day Funktionärskarriere optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the former vice - chairman of Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim of vermiesen.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard to begin.
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual Fußballbereiche.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA to improve, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun.
“ As Chairman, I would like to football as a whole. ”
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the Nationalauswahl, professional football, up to and including the Leistungsfußball for young people. ”
“ This is not to say that I want to do it all, ” said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
“ I am a Teamspieler, and therefore the powers of the executive committee, so that every member of a certain area. ”
And I will work hard so that the football in each segment at moving forward. ”
There were many enchanted, because they, rather than the work of other to criticise now itself really began to work hard, ” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the Fußballbewegung have considered, no longer standing.
“ I know that I am working 20 hours a day. ”
“ But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, I did not constantly put spokes and every step I make, in question, ” he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated.
“ A lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise there other. ”
“ The trust is that we should not waste, ” he said.
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work, which he suffered Hašek has begun.
“ In two years we have a great deal of work done and I will now not simply throw away. ”
“ It processes have been launched, the only in a few years to play out, and I would hate to see that they stop someone, ” he said, and now his concerns to saying that, in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
“ I believe in systematic approach and that is something that Mirek Pelta not. ”
“ Behind him, especially people who made the football would make that he only for exclusivity is there. ”
I may be some of the accused, but not that I would be biased. ”
“ I am trying to do, to be objective. ”
“ I want football for all of them, because it then all is well and not only the specially selected, ” said Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that it was only a chairman of the Czechs.
“ Even if some people claim the opposite, I really did, what is best for Moravia to do. ”
“ For example, it is time to consider whether the League is in a czech and part of a moravian should divide, whose winners will each in the first League aufstiegen. ”
“ Then it might not happen that today only three Moravian clubs in the league play, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem, ” said Rajchl.
Because it is now up to the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the fight for the office of the chairman, has joined dares Rajchl not to assess his chances that he is elected.
“ I feel a strong support in the chamber, the Czech me on her vice - chairman has chosen and now recognises that clear success stand behind me, ” led Rajchl with saving tens of millions of kronor disadvantageous for contracts, the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the Lotteriegesetz as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association of not in a single comes together.
Whilst Pelta says, “ he was disqualified from the outset, the czech football with greater confidence ”, he thinks of the second - Paclík rivals for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
“ No one can question in Pilsen in just a year ago, has done an excellent job. ”
“ He should be elected, he would probably things continue Ivan Hašek has initiated and also the personnel in the commissions it would obviously not fundamentally change. ”
It would make things certainly not in his favour altered just want, ” judging from Rajchl on its rival.
