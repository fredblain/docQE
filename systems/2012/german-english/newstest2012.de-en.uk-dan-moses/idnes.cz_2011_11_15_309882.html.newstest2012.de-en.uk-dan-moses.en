V Need for speed: “ the run ” - the illegal race across America
Recession
Originally, careless driving has been hit by a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer mistake to Routinefahrt to Frühschicht.
It managed to ambitions in large part to meet, but what is the point if no one seems to want a bit more to do.
Even before he came to the Ladentische, part of the new with the subtitle “ the run high expectations. ”
He promised, but the already bejahrte Spieleserie “ Need for speed ” back in a new dimension to delay in the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen he seemed really not only one of many action - Rennspielen.
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist of the car is rising and will continue on foot.
But as it was in NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is a lot different than it had expected.
Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade - race, but on the whole, the game by some unnecessary mistakes diminished in this series are already more or less for a few years to have a presence there.
So there are really no more mistakes, but rather evidence of a in principle incomprehensible laziness of the Spieleentwickler.
The adventure begins very well.
For now, it will be in the history of introduced, whose main character Jack personal nature of certain problems; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, will it get steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York to be.
The basic idea is a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is in ten stages and in more than 50 individual race divided.
This means that every race at another route, and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
It has no moment the impression that game is always the same.
Some areas are still very nicely, although the technical level of chart does not have the earlier parts of the series.
That is not something I get too excited about.
But the journey through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape wirk visually very pleasant.
Now and again bring atypical elements of a bit of a change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, is a surprise to the point of view of the desert storm cripples.
In the mountains, in turn, must be to watch your step, that is not an avalanche buried.
By the way are fairly well in a row the individual race.
Only a few, but they do.
For a while we tried, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), it still expected a duel between a face - to - face with a single opponent.
And there is also the police force that a blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack of the vehicle leaves.
It is more about certain interactive including animations, in which Jack before anyone escaping and where the players must help by it at the right moment, the right button.
So it is not complicated.
It is surprising, however, that it is in the game a lot less passages, as one would expect (actually the only three).
In the end, that is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because as this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above to the elements that make the game to vary.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts.
That is to say, from today 's point of view, is pulling out of the trees, on the other hand, you could not argue that it would be bad.
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren Fahrmodell our supermarket will remain very well, although the competition could find better.
Until then, as far as all in good order.
Real problems, there are only after a certain time.
In contrast to the Kollisionsmodell Fahrmodell is not O. K.
Of a game of this kind, it is hard to expect there to be complicated deformations and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea of how the car, then, is clearly not everything is in order.
Case in point: the close Überholen or Vorbeifahren of oncoming cars “ scratches ” it in some places in the other car only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but we went into a tailspin on wild performance.
Or the Karre to scrap metal.
Thanks to the Restart - system which is nothing more, from annoying it is ever - present.
The Restarts are so resolved: if you have destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference.
Only - in every race has only five Restarts.
When they are exhausted, everything is from square one..
The Restarts are actually more of something like a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but rely on it is hard.
Sometimes does not help the Restart, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often to the same places.
Some curves, for example, in a very specific way, because otherwise if we simply do not.
Elsewhere, there is a list of the “ civilian ” cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether you as a first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly in situations annoying when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but until it gets to the cars are already in such a position that they get or delay.
And it is no matter when they arrive, everything is designed to have this situation to always close to your nose.
The opposing parties have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always in the same place from the same opponents will be overtaken again regardless of the time.
On Verrücktesten, this is the end of the game to the long bridge, one in the head.
The Kontrahent a must here seem to come hell or overtake.
And if he then had a is, then that is a, of course, the point of view, so that they initially by car a couple of times in Klump drive.
Clearly, you want the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clearly that they quickly the pleasure the game spoiled.
And that is a shame, because, in spite of a simpler Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and at times so aktionsgeladen that they no longer know, where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what “ guilty ” of it is - the concept with 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that no boredom, pay, or something else …
A far - fetched idea is also the Wagenwechsel during the race.
We must filling stations on the road not overlook the fact that just because you cannot change the car, even though in most cases the car enough that it is.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are good for the urban areas, the strong american brand for the precise motorways and exotic super sports car for the technical journeys, for example, to the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way Spielgeschichte is also the tasks - mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities, which is in the history of it.
There is not only medals, but also own Erfahrungspunkte for the win, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to enhance the Fahrerniveau, have different open: the car started to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is, at the same time as the online role Autolog, among other things, the own achieved results compare with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
A further incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here it is: the car in an underground tunnel (I), where it was in the dark on the track for boils (say).
On the Tacho look paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h (I), but there is at once from behind a metro and drives a hard - line to scrap metal.
In our editorial we will probably still argue for a long time about whether this was a Blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether the authors to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression that, in most cases, appealing and here and there, even brilliant.
Even more galling is that some of the exciting moments Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatic.
That is particularly the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS not of any good.
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache.
In an effort to such a broad range of possible as more young audience, was a “ Soundtrack lá each of something ” - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? the feelings are more mixed.
When the game not by these totally unnecessary mistakes would diminish if we had with the held conviction able to claim that the run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But in fact, the game somehow unfinished.
In a class for pleasure, but we must be prepared for this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye.
