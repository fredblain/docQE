Asphalt of the UNAM prevented bumps
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of chemistry in the mexican UNAM university developed with Polymeren Asphalte modified to the mix more resistant to weather and temperature changes to make
In the message, the road surface, respected, would it not be necessary, nearly 200 000 bumps to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the appropriate Asphaltbelags were to happen, the number of bumps significantly reduced or even fully be avoided.
In his presentation “ bumps from a technical point of view, ” he at the International Year of Chemistry, that he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing a similar to the asphalt mix, but more of a mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot, such as in some towns in the north of the country, should be used to the behaviour of the surface of improving the incidence of Schlaglöchern to avoid.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung is, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so - called Asphaltene - and the other is part of a low - the so - called Malthene. along the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behaviour.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, 120 degrees, it is very zähflüssig and almost 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures is crumbling.
“ This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but one day, depending on the weather and temperature change ”, the engineer.
The researchers FQ said, the streets of Mexico City would have a majority of a flexible road surface, which is made up of six Materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt.
Between the top layers are some Verschleißschicht from asphalt, from small, in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Every single piece of this Verschleißschicht, bathing in asphalt.
If the vehicles to travel and forces are produced, allows for this class is a good power in the road surface.
“ If it would be modified asphalt, would the forces is even more to distribute, ” said the engineer.
“ On the Verschleißschicht ”, he tells us, “ is a final layer, the so - called Tragschicht, from the tiny stones, i. e. of sand, also in the asphalt bathing.
Since this shift is in contact with the tyres are, they need greater force than the mechanical Verschleißschicht and friction.
The road surface this most forces receives and distributed, needs the Tragschicht also a proper thickness and the material from which it is, will need to be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature, are other important factors taken into account, and above all the water, ” he said, “ because it undermines the behaviour of the Verschleißschicht considerably.
If the terrain is wet, water in the class and is just back from difficult. created the weakening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of Schlaglöchern.
If a pothole ”, he said, “ will be the first Deckschicht flattened, while the Verschleißschicht only then will be affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of appropriate Wartungsprogramme maintained. ”
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Mexico 's innovation Investigadores (national) said that the Fahrzeuglast another important reason for the actions of Schlaglöchern. must therefore be the size of each layer on the surface is in relation to the Fahrzeuglast and it is important to ensure that to avoid frequent Schlaglöchern this rule will be met.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there are still many research would take, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries, even on the market, and with which the bumps simply and without using high temperatures repair.
