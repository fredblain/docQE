Park or mountain?
The architects, in addition to the bickering over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona anew.
In the mid - 1980 's, at the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge Park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the Park, in the eyes of many again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in the North - South spread, but upwards (mountains) and down (Sea).
The classification Collserolas as natural park plays with this idea.
As an example, served is no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was, as the city in September a Riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 competitions, for further Zugangstore after Collserola.
No doubt, a gateway to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone, gates into the country.
The question is: Collserola, parks or mountain?
The announcement is not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city of the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste, which is in the lift, can turn.
And it is this fact is the stuff of one of the rare common ground between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors, on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
“ It is necessary for Roldán, ” after the attack on the coast on the “ front of the mountains ”, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, not pregnancy.
“ We should start from the principle that Barcelona is the greatest Park beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, ” judging from the architect, for the title of “ the gates of Collserola ” a “ collective ” case: we must not “ as access to a park, but as a ring - fencing of areas in which we need to act. ”
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a “ intellectual challenge, ” the “ some risks ”.
Risks from the “ uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings with it ”, according to the experience in the 1980 's, in the area of the Forum of their “ swan song. ”
The first fear is the limit on what must be developed.
“ This limit always means, the next step ”, i. e. it.
“ We must think about new urban planning tools, because the current [with reference to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can become a real catastrophe. ”
Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplified, the side of Collserola towards Vallesana is, “ can be understood as a park, in the sense of not Barcelona ”, and for purely topografischen reasons.
Modol recalls that it has a study by the Patronat de Collserola that are not “ should fall on deaf ears, ” though he is grateful to the town hall that his body the opportunity in this project “ from the outset. ”
In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the town of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects, participate in the debate, even though he “ doubts ” to say whether this technical profile the first launched in multidisciplinary teams (“ exactly the right, ” he says “ we should guide) architects should only be a tool. ”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as in the offering of a global view of Collserola lacked: “ there were 16 competitions in the cross - section of advertised, ” he says, “ on the axis mountains - sea, but there are no Längsschnittperspektive the area seen in its entirety. ”
That has, at least in his case that led it to the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the Tors also clash.
In his view, should the city a guarantee that the strip of directly on the Dalt de Ronda, in all its length so that a soft transition between the town and the green belt.
