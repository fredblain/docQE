Troops feel sympathy rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street - Gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, collected a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The amount in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
“ The servicemen and women have been seen as a hero, ” said David Saltzman, the Spendenaktion organised in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, on the Stabchef and then Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
“ They were introduced as orphans, ” the officer wrote in an e - mail.
I am sure that the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But it was no respect, not really, it was sympathy for them.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring american public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige.
The public is acting increasingly, as do the people in uniform of suffering.
“ We were not sacrifice, ” said Brigade General B. Sean MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan soon after.
“ But it seems that the only way the support of one of us in the role of unfortunate souls to inflate. ”
The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders, not ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, seem to want.
They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in recent years of the Vietnam War clothed, much worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion on the quiet and private between war veterans.
After his two sons from fighting with the marines have returned, warned the Colonel (a. D. Mark Cancian them from that people outside the world of their military service from two different perspectives could see.
Some of them with a sense of awe, since they rebels defeated and to exotic places have visited.
Others wonder whether a “ angry, violent veteran under the surface, ” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and after his return, a senior Staatsposten in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly erfragten, whether he was unable to immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
“ If you talk about your service, they must be the negative impressions argue, ” declared Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in a lack of interest on the part of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield, a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is rarely as praise singled out.
“ We as a nation estimate military heroism is not more so, as it has been in the Second World War was normal practice, ” said Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the focus of the praise of the politicians and the public largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, they are suffering, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries.
