Euthanasia and assisted Freitod must be legalised, a panel of
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada shows
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best allows funding, and this, too, of the cases of cancer alone.
The canadian company is living in a recipe to the death.
Only 9% of Canadians who are, in fact, with their doctor to speak on the conditions under which they would like to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report of the Royal Society of Canada, to the six experts were involved in various disciplines, among other things, ethics, law and medicine, are related to each other.
This panel recommends the government, so the penal code to amend assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia, where this election, and in patients than in the situation, to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent survey of the independent society EIU, the Todesqualität in 40 countries of the Erdballes compared with each other.
Although Canada is in the 10th grade centers, the study noted that “ the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to broach the subject of death ”.
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts.
And despite the desire of the majority of Canadians, at home to die, die, however, ultimately 68,6% of these in the hospital.
The whole country standpoint, the rate of 86% of deaths that have occurred in the hospital in Quebec.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the author of the report 's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which already has geäuβert, no changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide to make, entgegengerichtet.
But now we have, according to the experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected, the approach of euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide or have decriminalised, no evidence that such a decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting people.
On the contrary we encounter much more cases of such breaches in the countries in which euthanasia and legalised assisted suicide is not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a signatory of the report, in a teleconference confirmed.
“ Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is illegal. ”
“ Also assisted suicide is in Canada, although it clearly illegal, ” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of the euthanasia
Let us remind us that, according to a 2010 carried out - Angus Reid poll already 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had, as they are of the opinion that these people would like to make it at the end of your career, to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of a euthanasia does not have to deliver the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled people less value besäβe.
In terms of the people who have an assisted suicide, represented the 41% of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted.
What maintenance or suspension of funds in patients, as the situation is less clear, as the author of the report.
Similarly it in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis suggests that in the penal code should be indicated that the possibility of making the funds, for the rejection of a legal have been before, not a criminal.
The panel also calls for health care professionals in the job training should be a possibility of making money on the end of life to respect, and that without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked, for the best allows funding, and this, too, of the cases of cancer alone.
Least calls for the body to the measures already in the canadian institutions to far - reaching health - care means used to pain relief lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen or, at the very least, to consider, as these nor the euthanasia served to physical pain to reduce and this on the same procedures bezögen.

“ This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone, the lebensmüde and older than 18 years, is a different person to ask him in his suicide to help, ” RA Deschamps, the yesterday a summary of the report looked at.
RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report, the ownership of the individual over all other values, in the social Gewirke of society are involved.
But now, he says, there would be “ guidelines and commitments in a society. ”
