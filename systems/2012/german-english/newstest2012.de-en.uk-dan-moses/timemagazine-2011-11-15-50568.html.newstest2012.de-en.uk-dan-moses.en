7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, this week in a theatre was shown
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared some of it with Henry Ford and raised the Technikgenie as a large, modern inventors.
What Apple 's fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs - interview, which this week in particular Filmvorführungen on the major markets dusted off, is how much the creative head networking and routines understood.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self - appointed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the eager to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who thought that many managers in “ a disease of thought ”, “ a really great idea 90 per cent of the total work … [but] there is a huge amount of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. ”
Bob Cringely 1995 developed the tv series “ triumph of Fachidioten ” as a result of the personal computer, and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs, in one of the rare, detailed talks led.
At that time, and 10 years since jobs from Apple. and he has already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview in Fachidioten has been used, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview in the supply were missing.
Jobs death only after it was also found that a full copy of VHS - in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film footage that forms the basis for the 68minütigen film “ Steve Jobs: the Lost, ” the interview this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark - theatre.
For someone who is well - known for detailed interviews detests seems surprisingly busy jobs here in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly interesting.
In the course of the interview, it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly weighed up his ideas and accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs, ” perfect to days when he apparently impatient Cringelys responded to questions and anschubst more quickly with issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included seems the lost interview somehow incredibly far - sighted, if jobs assessed what other companies believes is right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to posthumous awards the career jobs ” to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things might be and should be.
Just after he has said all had, and he made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews:
As he learned to do business:
“ Throughout the years in the business, I always ask: “ why are you doing things? ” and the answer that you always have, is: “ oh, so it will be easy. ”
No one knows why he is doing what he is doing, no one in the business think very carefully about things.
I have found.
Jobs his efforts on the accounting for Apple to streamline.
Perplexed, such as cost record - usually began with “ Standardkosten ” at the mere suggestion put out, and then with the “ anomaly ” - it developed the automated factory, who ensured that the Geschäftskosten to micromanage being identified.
As the Pope veralbert:
Jobs told of the “ blue boxes ” that he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device which we have been in the telephone company slip and long - distance calls for nothing.
On the device much has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm, the blue as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, making it a gebührenpflichtiges phone use, and then make a phone call from an AT &amp;amp; T network to another, while so many satellites as possible durchschleifen.
“ We sent about a half - dozen times around the globe and if we telephone grölte, there was a minute later in the telephone next door out ”, tells kichernd jobs.
“ We were young and we learned that we ourselves can make something that billions of dollars in infrastructure in the world can control. ”
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing, which is a huge thing can control, that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without them, Apple would be.
Jobs told further away from a glorious gimmick, the Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night via Blue Box in the Vatican phoning and with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could, Henry Kissinger nachmachten.
As several members of the catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night, have been called in to deal with the american diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself up the phone.
As he has been in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a Frequenzzähler, seeking to Bill Hewlett in telephone directory and called on it to.
Shortly after her 20 - minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part - time at Hewlett - Packard.
“ This has had a remarkable influence on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated. ”
Later, Jobs one of the HP - the research laboratory of the company in Palo Alto, where he visited “ the first 's desktop computers, ever made ”.
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher Röhre and I verliebte me in it.
I would, if HP as a teenager and climb to the top of this machine, and programmes, they write.
How innovation improved:
Several times in the interview talking about jobs and about how to spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career, when he some einbaute situation, he was asked by a customer, the whole computers assemble them.
He was working with a payment of only 30 days and had both the assembly processes and the extradition of the ready - made equipment drawing board.
Later on, Apple he will recall the problems in the development of a Computermaus:
“ I remember very strong arguments … they screamed at me, that it would take five years to a mouse to build the $300 would cost] and I went out and found a manufacturer. ”
90 days later we had a mouse, for $15 to construct. that was amazing credible.
On large companies that continue:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in stumbling and control over their shares lost.
“ We say, you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printers, so what? ”
You have the Aktienmonopol, so is the company was more successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so there are such people [are] at the end of the day, the companies and the product, with which the people from the decision - making process.
The Produktgenie, which led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, wiped out - Handwerkskunst necessary.
That happened in Xerox …
Xerox had all the computer industry.
We have ten times more can be, the Microsoft of the 1990 's can be …
You have the defeat by the victory.
About innovation as an art form.
“ It 's a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product … if this great idea, they are changing and growing. ”
We are learning a lot about its nuances.
It must be votes, certain things that you can 't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5,000 terms, these concepts, and all of them together …
In the end, it amounts to the taste, what it comes down to is that we try to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these matters to the together, what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly steal in the grand ideas.
Part of what makes Macintosh great was made, that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not be in the computer business, they would have been in other areas of fantastic things.
