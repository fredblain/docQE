On a personal level, mass slaughter
Einfühlsam and generous begins Peter Englunds new book “ beauty and a history of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies ” with a long list of main people who contribute to a to heart.
Here, a piece of advice about how we could: you are raising this side of caution and you make it to your Lesezeichen.
You will see these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well to get to know each other, and these protagonists than your GPS function, as the beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and lost your illusions are deprived of.
Peter Englund is a swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has an unusual book written, which he did not incorrect as “ a work of the anti - history ”.
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather “ a book about how it was. ” it is about “ emotions, impressions, experience and moods. ”
“ Beauty and the experience of war of terror ” almost 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, Krankenwagenfahrer and clerks.
Some of these people to be heroes.
Some are prisoners of war, to lose Gliedmaße, be crazy or die.
Each of these lives truce as Votivkerzen in a church that some will add, while others fade away.
Englunds book is different from the usual history books.
It also revised the idea, the First World War was just the devastating entrenched position in the Westfront.
“ Beauty and horror ” moves with Expertenblick on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, of East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, a fall Bienenkörbe celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.
This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book.
The war has flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina, the following Kordit smell.
Imagine you are a woman who at home with their children, and the cannon 's fire in the distance, you hear or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war in the first place.
“ A lack of facts, ” Englund said that “ were on assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, hare - brained ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares, rumours treaty. ”
“ Beauty and horror ” follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an english nurse in the russian army, and Richard root, a young german Schiffsmatrosen.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already published material removed.
Your Lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple, but they are very alive in Englunds the details in that collection of small moments.
Many of them act of shortage and Behelfen.
In the history of a german Schulmädchens tells it: “ a substitute, replacing everywhere. ”
“ Ersatzkaffee aluminium, wrong, wrong, eraser Papierverbände, Holzknöpfe. ”
He told more of the Ersatzessen in Germany.
He describes “ the meat from large compressed and rice cooked in Hammelfett (and least with a false bones from wood served), tobacco, from dried agricultural roots and dried Kartoffelschalen, shoes, with wood besohlt. ”
There was, as he noted, “ 837 Nahrungsersatzmittel registered in the manufacture of hot dogs were allowed, 510 - registered Kaffeeersatzmittel. ”
Some stories act of honour and bravery.
An American acknowledges its own rush towards the ferocity and says of the war: “ one feels that in spite of everything that is, more for men than in Lehnstuhl to sit with the Abendblatt or the best - seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and to do so, as such a façade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind the own strengthened and beschlagenen Hemdbrust. ”
Conversely, a british soldier recognises that it is likely to die, and no one notice or would be done.
“ If you by the idea of self - sacrifice, is backing away, you would think that this is happening in front of an audience, ” he writes.
Instead it is so terrible as “ a convicted man who was hanged in secret. ”
Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror.
“ The conflict has been a growing economic competition, ” writes Englund, “ a war between the factories. ”
He catches the arrival of a what he “ a new species in the Bestiarium the young century ”: “ the word - looking and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick, the slaughter, while he is sitting behind a desk. ”
People behave to unforeseen way and there is also frivoles behaviour such as heroic acts.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively trying to a prostitute with a Geschlechtskrankheit contagion to the Frontdienst to escape.
“ The bizarre expression can trade with Gonokokken - Eiter discovered, as soldiers and bought their genitals grease, in the hope that the way to enter the hospital to come ”, he writes.
“ Those who really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which led to them the rest of their lives were blind. ”
In this translation from a Peter Graves will Englunds poetry and elastic but intrusiveness and fit perfectly in his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, as the war “ in unprecedented fashion uncontrollable forces unleashed: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred. ”
The people are starting to ask why their leaders for fighting.
The best books about the First World War were mainly a distorted as Paul Fussells “ Great was and Modern memory ” or novels as Erich Maria Remarques “ nothing new ” in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds bond is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle.
His book, the most devastating, at the end of which I ever in a Sachbuch read.
I am no longer.
But it is, as he would have us with his book with this side of the protagonists in the nose and snapped with a match on fire.
