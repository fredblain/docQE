The military is the increasing pressure to crack down on rape
This week to decide an important hearing about whether 28 men and women because of non - intervention in a rape before the military court to be charged.
It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Obergefreite Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped at night by a Soldatenkollegen.
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego, the dinner with a friend, as a male colleagues, who was the one 12er Pack beer in itself.
He asked her whether to accompany a drink in their rooms.
“ My alarm bells to, ” said Lyman.
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns.
I thought: “ no, no, he is 19.
He is from Texas, ” she said.
“ I wish I had on my gut instincts. ”
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and they were raped, it claims.
This week, on 18 November, wait Lyman and 27 other current and former Militärangestellte anxious to a trial with an historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a charge against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have to be in court are allowed.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not widespread rape in the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D. C., comprised of the lawsuit initially 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of which claim that they are of Soldatenkollegen raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or a reasonable case law after the alleged attacks to provide.
Burke says it is monitoring the supreme military command, because the problem there will begin.
“ The military is hierarchical ”, she says.
“ But who are the individuals in the position, the culture of retribution to eradicate the lead. ”
Burke also says that since February, it has been in contact with almost 400 more survivors, many of them may be part of future claims.
Your strategy: instead of claimants, so to speak, for all their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints to submit to keep up the pressure.
The team of defence for the Department of Defense, led by Bundesstaatsanwalt Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action.
The files of the court, the Newsweek, lead, in detail, the defense to, first of all, that the military does not of current or former soldiers for injuries can be tried in the armed forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court in the 1950s, the so - called “ Feres Doctrine, there is the government not for injury, which is in active service, the soldiers to be added.
“ The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs, ” says the document.
The Department of Defense refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not to the service in the fight are permitted, it is only on behalf of the distinction: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams play by female soldiers increasingly important roles, especially in the contact links with local women in the war zones.
The result: between the two wars died 150 soldiers, two - thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time for the military modernisation, says Burke.
And it is in their fight not alone: three further apart from their complaints are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran ” Legal Services Clinic lawsuit against the four main military academies, because of alleged promoting a hostile atmosphere.
This independent collects the not - for - profit Vietnam veteran of America a legal case against the military government, to be the diagnosis “ personality disorder ”, the rape victims received it from the service to a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati, the Service Women 's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group, in December, a complaint against the veteran Administration (, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in dealing with entitlements for people accusing felt, in the service of sexually abused.
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse), Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses.
But the majority of abuses are not registered at all and the estimate of the Pentagon 's own account of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, on the face of it a year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the Strafverfolgungsraten: 2010 came 20 per cent of recorded cases in the military in a court of law, only half as many as in the civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In case they Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was 11 times, asked the details of her rape of a whole series of police officers, doctors and military commanders to tell.
You had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was by a judge heard. during this hearing, it was after the sex asked before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said as Charakterzeugen on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of will, in the end, was acquitted.
“ I remember the day when the verdict was read out, ” Lyman says.
“ I thought that would go into labor. I ran screaming from the courtroom. ”
“ They brought me to the psychiatric unit and I remember that I, when I came out again, to my commander said that was not his trial. that was my procedure. ”
Lyman has been asked to visit Militärpsychiater will, in the end, a personality disorder diagnosed and for dienstunfähig said.
In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so that they do not support.
Whether the complaint that the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.
However, it says: “ I believe they are making progress. ”
What between them and a verdict is, is this doctrine, criticised the will, for the first time, was called into question.
I am a critic throughout their life the Feres Doctrine.
The military is still lagging behind a decade later, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability.
He adds: “ the odds are against them … but it is important for them to try. ”
These things will only change, if good people are ready to fight.
If the item is not hearing their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
“ We are going to the military, in this regard, continue to fight until reforms ”, she says.
Or until we die, whatever the first.
