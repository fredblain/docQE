What represents the fraud at Krankmeldungen?
After the family benefits take (UMP) and the government now Krankmeldungen in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, arrive for a visit Familienbeihilfekasse and made a speech on the already - since 2007 has always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud, as well as economic dependence on the state.
This attack to accompany the of the will, the economy in a Härteprobe, on the other hand, not just as a harbinger of the axis of the right - wing presidential campaign, will the majority on Arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen focus.
First, with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a Krankmeldung by workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company the pay of four days, would lose, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, “ Les echoes ” threatens to provoke anger, however, would help, 280 million euros.
And with a different Maβnahme more symbolic nature: the state officials were accompanied by a unvergüteten Karenztag in Krankheitsfalle give (so far they have, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).
Meanwhile, these questions in the debate, sparked the majority also anew the Betrugsthematik, this time at the Arbeitsabsenz associated with abuse are targeted.
“ Inspections will be much more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if this is called for, ” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 before the microphone to the station RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this news about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive, the most common have borne fruit.
The French are not more ill more often than those elsewhere in Europe.
However, our first in the nation - wide paragraphs.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM were in 2006, more than EUR 237 million Tagesabfindungen paid off.
The Gemäβ Wirtschaftsforschungs Dokumentationsinstituts - and the health system, the Tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of the health - care costs.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave, as well as industrial accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube, the heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And so, 2.5% of health spending.
In the year 2010, the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting group, on average, only 14.5 Krankentage granted.
An average of certain differences covered up, a different, in 2007 of monster. com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 000. surveyed, french workers, not a single Krankentag had.
Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of the Krankmeldungen in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, between 15% and 15 days a month ago, 15% of between one and three months and 11% over.
Compared with its european neighbours, the french workers is not more than elsewhere to disability benefits.
A in 2010 by two researchers of the french state, Centre for Wissenschaftsforschung (CNRS) - led long - term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote (away - or otherwise justified) oszillierte, in France, between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud at Krankmeldungen is a very small proportion on the black market.
On the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved.
The encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that it controls on systmatische Krankmeldungen are 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 000 of past, short - term Krankmeldungen, the heiβt in 37.050 cases ”, abusive or too long. ”
In the systematically controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days the long term if you were among 1.2 million 11% of “ unangepassten or unjustified ” cases, heiβt 132.000.
Overall, this is 169.000 “ unjustified ” cases to millions of workers, a Krankmeldung.
A paragraph, the only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, that of the undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of one published in July Sachberichts with regard to this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro Steuergewinnausfall per year, i. e. more than the total cost of Tagesvergütungen, and thus far more than the Defraudation that.
