Europe has a democracy, so it remains, european democracy to rethink
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate asset.
The european continent itself should remind you who is after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the whole of the 20th century the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, the gulag, but also in Franco 's Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece has had to endure.
Some were believed that it would be sufficient, the right to vote, to representative possible way to democracy once and for all of their enemies will prevail.
We know since Napoleon the “ small ” that it is a feature of the state of mind.
The general right to vote, the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can just as well for the “ repression ”, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers, and control a training, education, economic and social spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and, first and foremost, political and democratic crisis.
The attitude of the greek Wahr - wrong - referendum would have been in this regard twice: once the insightful nature of the need for a strong return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the alarming sense of their inability to deliver their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today have shifted, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer moving in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, to the success of the national referendum, which, depending on the needs and in or order was organised.
A Freischein for the european or a giant leap with their eyes in the hollowness of the nationalist withdrawal: a groβartige choice for the citizens.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from right, clear and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at the european level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, incidentally, has already no longer, where the list to end - as it is only a single crisis, and that there is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, the dictates of the markets and rating agencies prevents that under his impotence and his Solidaritätsmangel suffers.
It is the whole of Europe, which humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about Souveränitätstransfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and every single one of the nations connected him.
The urgency is the sovereignty of the leadership of the european project back.
Because it is on the set, whether the Europeans the burden of debt reduction from the markets to a future through investment at hand.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at the european level on the condition that is not complete without democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be passed without sure to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists for a long time to tackle, today, one in the european economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy, as they have in mind - present, would be a new folly and another dead end.
We need a new stage of european integration.
In the Republic of France to create, it took the fact that Republicans to “ create ”.
The revolution of the interests of alone, it is not enough.
This instruction is still valid.
On the economic front, we need a more integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe, creating a truly european sovereignty.
We need Europeans to Europe.
