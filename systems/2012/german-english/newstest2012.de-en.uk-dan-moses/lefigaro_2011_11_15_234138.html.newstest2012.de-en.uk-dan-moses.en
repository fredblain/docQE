The world of the republican presidential candidates gemäβ
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and lack of knowledge about China 's, Iraq, and support for Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world, with simple, not to say: stupid ideas?
If the republican presidential candidates, listening to voters in almost this impression.
For a few days to Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their comrades - in - arms thundering their statements, and their statements regarding the Auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and the Israel - aid, often in any way - based slogans.
In terms of the appointment of the “ Grand Old Party ”, is the highest in the course of the Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to the WTO and they quote the “ currency manipulation ” - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia on Äuβerste would prefer not to accuse.
Stupid gone, if this is the introduction of a trade war is to imply, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate, the vision of a mature Auβenpolitik seems to have, almost in terms of the conduct of the emotions schmeichelnden strangled.
He had a full - blooded, but constructive Gesprächsaustausch with Beijing (also called on the current position of Obama 's).
But Huntsman is not heard, because he was in the depths of the opinion polls is stagnating.
Reagan 's equal
Romney also had military strikes against Iran praised, if sanctions to talking the Nuklearprogrammes fail.
“ Should I am elected, and an I stop Iran ”, he had on hearing.
“ Obama is re - elected, they get the bomb. ”
Auβerdem he has greater military promised to help Israel and Obama charged that partner commitments guilty of having remained.
The businessman Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, for its part, a shameful Aktenunkenntnis on display.
Recently, he shouted to the chinese Militärbedrohung cons, as Beijing “ is trying to develop a nuclear power ” and appeared in the fact auβer to that China has since 1964 in possession of military Atomarwaffen!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry of Israel and military strikes against Iran, äuβert, for its part, ready to be the american army in against drug cartels in Mexico.
Obama 's 2009 banned use of Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also of Cain, Perry and the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a long way from John McCain, the republican candidates in 2008, a auβenpolitischen emphasis.
The current Präsidentschaftskontrahenten, Reagan had also simple ideas, and in spite of all that won the Cold War.
They call to mind the fact that Obama also selbstein amateur, and water in its wine to be had, with regard to the issue of anti - terrorist.
You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his “ boys ” from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, but also the reputation of the weakness.
These Anfeindung, however, is not quite so freely.
The population estimates the more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, the Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq careful not to military intervention, the clog up.
And Obama surprised by appropriate, he argues that America needed to economically to be rebuilt in its leadership.
