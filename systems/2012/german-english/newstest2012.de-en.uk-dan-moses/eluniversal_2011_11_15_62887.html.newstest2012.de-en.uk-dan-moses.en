MSS presents a Forschungsprotokoll for the location of the gene for obesity levels
Mexico 's Social Security Institution you is leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people, the specialist the IPN is supported.
The Instituto del Mexicano Seguro Social - IMSS Social Security Institution (Mexico) has announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title “ genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence, ” opens with the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the de Unidad Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) to the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Nacional Médico Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, Krankenpflegern Ernährungsspezialisten, and social workers was built.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) Instituto Nacional del Politécnico (IPN.)
The public is invited to take part in the study, interested parties can to sports the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 p. m. tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation on the football field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) started and since 8 October on the football field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue.
If the aim of 500 - 600 Untersuchungspersonen is achieved, will the study on the football field of Independencia (in the south) Hauptstadtbezirks continued and in Morelos (in the north) Hauptstadtbezirks concluded.
He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said there will be three thousand seeks to ensure that children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the understanding and under the supervision of their parents food - related to fill out questionnaires.
You will also be questions about their physical activity, and their family Krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors, diabetes and renal insufficiency could lead to, to control.
He also that these Saturdays the Untersuchungspersonen measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), their blood pressure control and Blutwerte as the Glukosespiegel, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt the identification of genes in connection with childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López pointed out, this would take place at the concern of the health service personnel on the alarming weight gain of young people.
“ The Gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the percentage of obese 77 per cent of boys and girls from obesity to 47 per cent had increased, and the obesity has increased dramatically, ” said the expert of the IMSS.
He has said that the search for genetic markers is justified because the genetic history of the mexican population from the other peoples unterschiede.
He stated that a (e) of Mexicans (in) on average to 65% indianisch - american, european and 30% to 5% of african origin is in their genes with diabetes and obesity, reflected.
In general, he said, the genetics of obesity, the inability of the surplus to us, the prospect of Energy (calories) to burn, so that those in the form of fat stored.
The researchers said the direct benefit to put research participants would be a full investigation into the children, in the states, whether this a level of obesity or obesity.
It would even the existence of dark Hautfalten on their backs and on Innenarm Akanthosis (), on the likelihood of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information would be kept confidential and the parents in writing from the doctors told the doctors say the parents all measurements and beat them lifestyle changes for the prevention of disease are appropriate.
Cruz López said that there would be three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible: lack of exercise, the lack of movement in daily life, for most of the day in front of the television to spend and means of transport to use short routes, instead of walking.
The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and analysis (Tamales, bread, hamburgers, pizza, etc.), along with a high - fat and Eiweißaufnahme, as well as the field of genetics, which in this research project to be analysed.
