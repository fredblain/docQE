A look at today 's headlines shows how serious and widespread fraud and lie in day - to - day life.

In the last week has been on an open microphone mitangehört, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the US President Barack Obama to claimed that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers, shaking countries.

Stories about Schummeln in school and college tests are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers to their students the Prüfungsantworten set so that they themselves in their Leistungsüberprüfungen well launched.
Mentors, the opposite teach should send a message that lies and Schummeln okay.
How much deception we see?
As studies show, lie us every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as lies.
Another study shows that strangers each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting of lying to us.
Lies to see or “ lies ” is a highlight, to learn for every human being is important, both for personal and also for professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as Scharaden away, where the goal is, “ who you! ”, this is a deception Enttarnen a serious knowledge, based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities have been collected, the wide - ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
The result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies exposed.
Lies a look in the eye.
You stottern, suffused with zappeln stammeln, and not always.
This may, however, are not that this liar difficult to detect and expose.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, when he heard about the structure of the claim, the subtle Gesichtsausdrücke, and timing is learning.
I have a couple of years spent the scientific results of the broad and ever - growing area of the passport to investigate, and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception a modern ability is easy to understand, and we in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world helps, especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good, other people to assess their interests and their own emotions to dominate and they intuitively sense that other perceived to be.
Thanks to the research, we know the extrovertierte people more often than people lying introvertierte that men are more likely to have “ selbstorientierte ” lies serving up than women, whose lies more in other “ follow ” - in the rule so that they want to protect the feelings that married people lying to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell lies, are usually “ fat ”).
We also know that, if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others are less feel guilty, this person to have lied.
As you can see whether someone is lying?
The first, by the normal behaviour that person.
This is known as the “ Baselining ”, the starting point.
It is a point of reference for the future assessment of changes.
You are watching the attitude, the laughter, the Stimmqualität their trial.
You should know better, when someone is normally constantly walking along, so that they do not unfairly, if it during a meetings with the foot along.
Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
When you look at these accumulations, the alarm bells ringing, not as proof of a passport.
People who deceive bogged down, perhaps, to try to their history, to recall, perhaps, their feet in the direction of the door or reject it in terms of the outcome, change their position in a significant way or show a “ relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch ”, that deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in the attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Asking the signal often wrongly, that a Einstellungsgespräch is over, only to this relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch.
You also look at the language you trial.
By Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense when he claimed that his wife was killed on the live and a national search for her.
People can also be deceptive distanzierende language: “ I did not have sexual relations with that woman … Miss Lewinsky ” or if there is a question repeated knifflige in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use “ qualifying language ” when they knifflige a question to answer is: “ now … to tell you the truth … as far as I know … in good faith. ”
In this way, the response will be more wahrnehmend as objectively, which often set the alarm bells ringing.
There is no Zaubermittel to Enttarnen of lies, but we can learn skills, thanks to a passport is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can fall prey to fraudsters are rare, both in the private - as in the workplace.
