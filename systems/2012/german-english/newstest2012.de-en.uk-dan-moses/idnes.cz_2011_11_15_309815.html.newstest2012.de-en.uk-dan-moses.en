Experts say a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the initial article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit of gemeckert that a little bit too much food, for a start.
As anticipated, I do not have the slightest of what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of troubled characters and a seminar on how the “ place ”.
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, so more information and practical challenges before us.
But even if the course each on Saturdays and Sunday, he is still full.
This time, we debated with director exists (on the course, not a single man part), as a woman, not the ideal proportionierte figure.
And that is still the most of us.
The first is too short a neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is up to the Stylisten, broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got tips, such as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - that is, with great from the waist up, wide and narrow their waist - hip nicely and figurbetont attracts without too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between their waist and Hüften is so great that the rock or the pair of trousers really do not fit, you should at least a little bit to tailor - make their groups.
The you will certainly not regret, because well - based clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor - made Rock you feel are much better than in a “ off the, the full of high - and, in the absteht verrutscht their waist, and so on.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this lot of information and Figurtypen, I am pleased that a whole week I have time, I thoroughly over.
And yet, I fear that, given the homework assigned to it almost impossible to achieve.
Each of the Kursteilnehmerinnen received a Promi allocated, for which it is fitting attire and come up with to - Tagesbekleidung Abendrobe.
Should the current appearance, Modestil of the stars and the Figurtyp account.
I should Miranda Kerr “ attract ” that you possibly from the campaign Victoria 's secret.
In the heart of juble I, as it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, the last time well the hundred kilos of increased (okay, this is a bit of an exaggeration), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from ausschneiden magazines or on the Internet, and then printed grafisch.
In the “ Moodboard ”, as the whole result is to then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is very important, even on the side of the graphic Stylings.
The Stylist, the models are not only physically, but also creates the so - called product side in the journal (after specific target, for example, trend - handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good view.
With the information about Figurentypen angefüllte Samstagsvortrag, three visitors from the seasoned industry:
By Jan Stylisten Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the Modefotograf Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is the illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And eingeschickter Stylist can with a single Bekleidungsstück in a very different way to work.
The magic word means variability.
You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the wear jeans, a T - shirt or coat, you can have it but also on the naked body, Absatzschuhe to attract it as a dress.
It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and immediately, the whole look very different.
“ To play with, ” he said.
Most came to me but the Council to be the following: “ first of all you have to know the rules of perfect. ”
“ Only then you can violate them, ” said Jakub.
At last, is clear to me why we all these theories pauken must what to do with what can combine and why, even if, in Modejournalen often quite another to see.
By Modeschauen.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist much more Bekleidungsvarianten have prepared, as it will finally be photographed.
So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to be prepared, at least 15 to stylen.
And also that the clothing the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all that are going to have to get the attire.
That image and sometimes Styl half the success, swiping us Jan Pokorný.
You only need to be even Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing a world star with respect.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a Stylisten more reserved.
Even celebrities is often a waste of money for (the main thing is that I, as I am is a secondary issue).
And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size sport, as he or she really needs.
It will then be only googlen with security to note that the tabloid writes, the corresponding Promi have again or declined, and so on.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to not to believe that a Stylist only to the fashion to focus on and then the clothes “ assemble needs. ”
In his work he needs, in particular, with the people communicate, which he stylt and it must be a skilled psychologist.
People assess without, and to please his opinion.
“ If we have any manager, their Kleiderschrank to sift through and beautiful pieces to supplement, then it does not eliminate the whole a cupboard and say, my God, this is terrible. ”
“ At least a few worthy things on which they recommend what you can, ” says Mario.
He showed us specifically as a so - called “ Platztasche must contain. ”
In other words, so a bag at the their waist zuknöpft and in which all the necessary Proprietäten in.
No such clear terms, such as the gap, Abroller Haareentfernen Sicherheitsnadeln or does it contain such Utensilien, such as a Nylonfaden (helping the Stylist the photography of products such as handbags or hats from), specific clips to the back of the clothing gerafft will, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are prohibited, so that the material does not break down) and, of course, Nähzeug.
So that we not only have to listen to, but also something virtually can try, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor is, it can damage the Schuhsohle, much less the outside.
Us o klebten and klebten we …
With the gap, we must not even affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So you have really sent.
Mario delighted me by my “ creation ” without restrictions praised.
The skill is not just my strength.
All of this was just the fraction of what we in the second weekend - Fortsetzungskurs to be told.
One thing is I have since become clear - the Styling at a professional level, is not an easy task.
