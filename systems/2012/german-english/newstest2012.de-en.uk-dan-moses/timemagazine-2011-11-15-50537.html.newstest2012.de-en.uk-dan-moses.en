Walls have eyes: how researchers see you on Facebook
Before the new face of the right - wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, just one of many boys who their anti - Einwanderungsmeinung online broadcast.
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has a great deal of time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the extreme right - wing groups on the part of social support networks.
After the tragedy of this past summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy, you only have to connect on Facebook.
“ We have found that it was not difficult, to go to them, ” says Jamie Bartlett, the Hauptautor a recent report of the british Ideenfabrik DEMOS, on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide - and - seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch Bartlett, says that the researchers simply Werbetool the side have to use their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy decide exactly - as retailers have done for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far - right groups throughout Europe and visierte it with Adds, but rather than with a new band or a new Diätprodukt to effect, invited the Adds users to a survey in which after their level of education, their attitude to violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation, more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right - wing parties in 11 european countries to question - without even to her office would have to leave.
“ It is a fairly new research method, ” says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as a surprise hardly. online promoter of far - right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, “ those who make their online activism with an off - line activism combine sensible, democratic and less violent than those who are behind their computer screens to sit still. ”
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientists use the hand, study it all, of health issues to Gesellschaftstrends as in “ Likes ”, text messages and Statusaktualisierungen.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day add, generated Facebooks “ Datensupernova ” a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side of the title in the last five years, almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that this side of people studying, usually with his Clipboard on the road is not achieved.
“ If he had previously tried to people of the British National Party to ask, it was very difficult to identify them. ”
“ You had to inform the first of the party and they never would have access to, ” says Bartlett.
“ Facebook is everything away, you will go directly to them. ”
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to social health problems to identify and resolve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who their Vollrausch on Facebook, significantly more than the Problemtrinken tend to students who remained silent on the issue.
Moreno is proposing that equal students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they make many Statusaktualisierungen postet.
“ You can 't solve a problem if you have not heard of, ” said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co - author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development on Children' s Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
“ We have found an opportunity to vulnerable children to identify the, not been found. ”
Facebook zapft also constantly the data of its own people.
The Datenteam the side has statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentine 's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid - term elections, and a National Glücksindex produced (and the first data have been used on the all - access Facebook has perfected the digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great Datenfundgrube for other for research purposes, to make.)
But the users of Facebook, know that the side observed them, whether they want it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allowed one of the side 's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey, from which they do not even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines laid down as to how they collect data offline to online is allowed to do anything.
“ I do not believe that many users at all reflecting on the fact that researchers could study their profiles, ” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he public sides of students on Facebook investigated.
“ What it is, it was only for them and their friends. ”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a Forschungsteilnehmer absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a Nutzerprofil and in speeches are true.
“ What you on Facebook says and what is outside of Facebook, are two different things, ” says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as Technologieforscher that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best Forschungswerkzeuge is that everyone can use.
“ There is no substitute for the real world and with real people to talk to, ” he says.
“ Social research to turn to the social care and a lot of social life is still offline. ”
