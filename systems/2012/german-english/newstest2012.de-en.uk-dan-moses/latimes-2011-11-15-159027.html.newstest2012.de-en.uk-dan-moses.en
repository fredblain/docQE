Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the Gesundheitsgesetze, as a court case takes
On the same day that the Supreme Court behind closed doors to the politically teilende question about whether it is a challenge to the Gesundheitsgesetze by President Obama will hear, made two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and finally there is Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Chancellery gesponsort, that was the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges are meeting to discuss met on the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases handled an appeal by the 26 states against the far - reaching reform of the healthcare system, the last year by Congress approved a law in the conservative activists across the United States on the slogan.
The judge agreed with the hearing on; indeed, in March, a 5 1 / 2 - hour Grundlagendiskussion expected, probably the result will probably boost the Präsidentschaftskampf 2012, at the time, in which the court 's decision is made public, will be in full swing.
The lawyer, the courts, and will maintain that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, Attorney General once under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements' s cabinet, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies, the annual dinner of the federalist society, a veteran group, which the defence of conservative principles.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the law.
Another was the sponsor Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the enormous process is involved.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court on the debate, in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, America 's the Fraktionschef of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health - care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years events the federalist society.
And it is not against moral rules.
In fact, the judges by the code of conduct, free of the actions of the lower Bundesrichter.
They were there, they might well under the principle 4c Code, which states: “ a judge can get near law and other organisations to take part, and the judge, according to a spokesman for guest or programme does not a guest, such events. ”
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the with the case of related practices, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality - and - Regierungsaktivisten alert.
“ The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code gives the complaints by some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules for all other Bundesrichter apply, ” said Bob Edgar, President of the common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
“ The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trials at the court. ”
Your attitude and their support for this event a Spendenaktion undermine any right to impartial and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics, who say they are Gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups that are off the agenda, such as the federalist society, mix.
And the wife, Ginni Thomas ” is a well - known conservative activist.
However, the Conservatives that Judge Elena Kagan was a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration, when the first Gesetzesanfechtungen in the first instance in court.
Your critics urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias to withdraw because they are too much in defending the law committed to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do that.
