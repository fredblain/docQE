Urgent warnings from the Pentagon from possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he is warned that automatic budget cuts will weaken national security unnoticed, he delivered a financial chain reaction in the halls of the Pentagon 'to the battlefields of Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon has already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 billion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress does not end up in the spending.
“ The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, ” Panetta wrote in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, leading to a so - called seizure, would lead to 23% across - the - board cuts and an end to many new projects.
“ Such a high level of reduction, carried out in such ill - considered way, most of our ship - building projects and unviable, you can not three - quarters of a ship or buy a building and other efforts to modernize seriously harm, ” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“ We would also be forced to part us from a large part of our civilian staff to separate and, since the reduction as soon would be implemented, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, the goal is to be achieved. ”
“ These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage. ”
The cuts were, in the end, the combat forces take, ” said Panetta.
“ While the Kriegszeitkontingente in the war on terrorism, by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the Grundbudget the Kriegsbemühungen adversely affect, ” Panetta warned.
“ Recruitment were to be cut back, leading to delays in the attitudes and the Einstellungsaufsicht, supporting the war. ”
“ The salaries of the staff would be cut, with late payments to Kriegszeithändler leads and the legal and political support would be disrupted. ”
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details about the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defense.
“ The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world 's leading military power in the world. ”
“ We are strongly against these draconian action, ” the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, they Panettas letter published.
“ This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly none of us should impose. ”
“ The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed. ”
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure on a compromise on the budget will increase or demands will increase the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience in the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he was the head of the Pentagon 'came, and I know that he is facing tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister malte a gloomy picture, which might face a military shell, but without a core.
“ It is a ship without sailors. ”
“ It is a brigade without ammunition. ”
“ It is an air - without enough trained pilots. ”
“ It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are in a position to the mission, ” Panetta said in his opening address to the Pentagon.
“ It is a force of morality and alert and is not in a position to provide it with potential opponents. ”
“ You can be a really angry. ”
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led Panetta new details, such as reductions of “ significant operational risks creating: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global work and Eingreiffähigkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen leading. ”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest Verteidigungsprojekte the removal could fall victim, including those that already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
That list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a proposed new Bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug, the Army and Navy, in need of the Humvee to replace.
The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years, up to save $80 billion, but the supporters say, an important next step in the build - up is, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
