What was lacking the candidate del Valle to the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impact that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia could not get.
El Valle receives his 14. Misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna, on the Gewinnerpodium, a Silberkrone and the bond, which it as the new Miss Colombia, addiction.
With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the Zeder in itself, is already on the 's Department of 14 Misstitel and Melina is linked to the legion of Valle del Cauca, the crown almost in the hands of. proclaimed to the Misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that arises today, many are asking is: what was lacking?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a large, the favorite in each trial had shown that they have everything for the new Miss Colombia. will not be in vain to Queen of the police force and for Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue was elected to the title, the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor that is as crucial for the decision by the jury, the first Miss to appoint, is that it is the answer to the question, “ what kind of book, you most and why? ” from Murillo Martín Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, who were not convinced.
The young woman from the author of Valle del Cauca replied:
“ I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of a civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, most of my childhood, the “ small ” Prince is a very deep book.
At the moment I read “ guilt and atonement. ” it is a book of universal culture that we all should read. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a russian girl, a wonderful book, “ passions' says.
A response that did not like, firstly because of the term “ civilise 'and secondly, because it was not specific, had declared in what way each of her book, “ they had.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the result, “ the universe is wise, it is done and what has to happen.
And for all the people ask: lest a little “ small Prince. ” it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is high.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the Bevorzugte, all of which Beifälle einheimste and in the run - up to all get prices (catering competition, Oster Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte dressed and Reina Madre), “ the other candidates are jealous had made, what the Queen stresste, which therefore on the stage not shine. ”
And it noted in her first presentation to the swimming on the shore of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the Krönungsfeier.
Although they both appeared safe, but it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of the Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme “ Como en Casa ” in the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to been crowned Miss, “ shows that the candidate, the competition during the most prices wins, ultimately not Queen ”.
Valle was also at the end of the press from the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest in the social work not convince, which ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the make - up of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who is the social affairs of their country.
“ Beauty alone is enough for Miss Colombia. we need to look beyond the Körperliche, focusing on the social sense to focus on the fact that they are already taking part in the competition had worked on projects, ” she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the fibrosis, is in the Magengegend said, had sinned. but this is inconsistent, because the jury chose it as a candidate for “ natural beauty ” with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Hernán Jorge Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body, that it would be better, “ but their problem with the fibrosis in the belly, which for me to be honest hard to say was, put their scoring on the last day. ”
In the meantime, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos the view that the mistake the woman of Valle del Cauca, the surgery, which they had been subjected to.
“ Operations are: ok, but Valle did not know how they can do it properly.
Your body is never a strong side here, and she has had to pay. ”
Because of this prize, which was the first time the national beauty contest that arose after the appearance in swimming a cruel to forecast the true in the night. it has been getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, so they do not benefit from the crown.
Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact is that their Herrschaftsjahr Melina from today, not as the Queen, but as a Princess, a position that will, on naming the national beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions.
But will it as one of the Queen, which despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, escaped the crown was to go down in history.
