The innovator IBM enters into its second century of existence
They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this is the word “ longevity. ”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with the technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although since its establishment in a century has passed.
On this basis the longevity, already their first chief visionary behind Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he was of the slogan, countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were prepared to make a little bit of thinking.
Its slogan “ think! ” has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants place should (and, at the same time, to the title of the internal magazine on IBM as long ago as 1935 began issuing).
This was also the basis of Watsen well prepared business culture.
“ For us from IBM, this long - term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to his principles and not shying away from everything else all around it to change.
The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technology, the business and society to transform.
We hope that in the next 100 years, creating even more, ” said Samuel J. Palmisano, who is now director of the company, marking the anniversary.
Educational system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its workforce, in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia, the IBM - people had, as one of the first american workers paid holidays, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and a thoughtful set for best creators and distributors.
As more sophisticated, the long - term relationship of IBM with their customers.
The company was, from the beginning, the brilliant in the Talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM on any discrimination, and could be scheduled to pick and choose.
In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman will invariably - of Virginia Rometty.
Is the only 30 years at IBM, has adopted the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and Strategiechefin.
IBM makes in the last few years, so - called online Brainstormings, from where many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas there is enough in the company is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Its strong position in the business guaranteed the company a strong image and this inside and outside.
“ From the beginning, IBM had more of the concept of an institution, as a technology company, ” said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“ IBM is not a technology company, but a firm Geschäftsprobleme through technology helps solve, ” added George Colony of - Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or it with this presence directly.
IBM in the states of their logos for family “ Big Blue ” is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and Konsultationsleistungen with incredible - purpose of servers to nanotechnology.
Of all american technology company IBM most patents and five of its staff members were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best - known inventions include, for example, ATM machines, credit cards, Finanzswap bar code, or even the Diskette.
With around $20 billion stock market value (by market capitalization) IBM during this year, the second - largest technology companies (right after Apple), and for the first time since 1996 Microsoft obsolete.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate, for example, the attempt to their own operating system, OS / 2, the online service Prodigy, or the computer IBM pc Jr.
“ Business is based on the moving forward, so we should not be emotionell to the past ”, according to Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM is not a problem, his ground on various platforms to build, and if they do not work, they also must leave.
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls.
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM committed to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in each one - fifth.
It was still in 1990 with a hardware fünfzigprozentigem share more than most.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets at a value of $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of the future technologies.
In these investment goes IBM after 2008, as the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world fegte.
IBM also was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, in the midst of the Great Depression of its large scale of investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today 's crisis emerges unscathed.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig by 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is: everything can change - not only the values.
It is to be expected that this flexible giant also the next crisis.
