The threat is real
Following the discovery of the “ Zwickauer cell ” doubt turkish media in the german state under the rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “ bloody ideology ”, which is now again auflebe.
The murders of eight türkischstämmigen and a greek entrepreneurs from 2000 to 2006, an extreme right - wing background.
This news will be in Turkey and within the deutschtürkischen population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many german - türken in a long time totgeglaubtes spectre: since the burning in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with more extreme right - wing background against Turks.
In Germany, xenophobia, however, was never in question.
The right - wing extremist network uncovered reveals, however, proportions, whose dimension still is not clear.
“ The bloody Lebt ideology back on? ”,, the Internetausgabe the turkish newspaper “ Haberturk. ”
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, pointed out that one of the perpetrators of a V - man of Verfassungsschutzes may have been, and expresses concern that german authorities in the extreme right - wing swamp might be involved.
Calmly responded the turkish community of Germany: it reminded the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racial violence.
Just two weeks earlier, the turkish community in Berlin, together with german and turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the german - turkish Anwerbeabkommens thought.
In joyous colors was the co - existence staged as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, as the reporting of certain turkish media: “ Germany gift on the 50th ” is the title of an article in the turkish Haber Internet platform “ X ”, to which the background to the series of Will.
The Deutschlandausgabe the “ Hürriyet ” we cannot take this spiritual connection.
“ It starts to stink, ” is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
It underlines the fact that people have been murdered, the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done.
Most are critical in deutschtürkischen forums, the actions of the police and their later Fahndungserfolg discussed.
Why the german authorities not long ago came to my mind is, in extreme right - wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors.
Some people, at least rhetorically to drastic measures prepared: “ will continue to live here, it remains the migrants do nothing other than the self - defence and the armed forces. ”
“ This will probably be the best self - defence. ”
“ The quality of the education and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much the inner peace in Germany, ” writes, “ selenium. ”
What it means, if the inner peace in Germany is in danger, shows the attacks of Mölln Solingen and in the 1990s.
The photograph of the Brandruine Solingen is deeply rooted in the german and turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a real threat, and the Germans that suspicion and distance in right - wing violence could result.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we - feeling on the turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the turkish press at the time, in particular, the failure of the german policy after the attacks, criticizes, Helmut Kohl refused, the survivors of Mölln to visit.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the turkish President, at his funeral in Cologne but his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel was at the time in his speech on how many charges but Turks.
As berechne is the value of a people for the level of its very.
The current reporting the turkish media shows once again how deeply the suspicion of many Turk from Bremen in the abandonment of rule of law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re - evaluation of the extreme right - wing terrorism in Germany needs this time it openly.
