Europe 's most beautiful pools
Leap into the blue
Julie Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo - visual intrusion, Prunkpools in Budapest: who travel through Europe, may be a result of see - and after a Städtetour or a wandering the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.
A book shows where promotion in the water on the most beautiful.
If iris Meder over the past year and a half to Recherchereise was, one in her luggage not: their swimming.
Rücklings on the water, lying, they looked high in elaborately shaped domes, they swim marble - Putten, contrary to the most Beckenrand they waited, and staunte on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Like a bad, they took it in great haste in their Notizbuch on - with wissenswerten details on the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools erkundete Architekturhistorikerin Meder in this way, and it is now just in her book “ Badefreuden ”: Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic Badepaläste in the Black Forest, “ hardcore ” Betonbauten in Taunus.
By 13 countries, it introduced its “ trip to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe ”: in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland they visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each year a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year - old german is a real Badekultur - Enthusiastin.
With sport have little hat on, says Meder - just in the water is different.
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln Chlorgestank and have to accept, while the smell of Jogger betörenden Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy already in the park to listen to.
“ I have one day asked why swimming pools are always so must be ugly, ” says the Meder living in Vienna.
“ So I began to fine pools to collect. ”
Mains doubled architecture
Geplätscher in Sprungbecken and essential oils sauna - the Wellnessfaktor in bathrooms is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders of trouble, can be a real Schwimmhallen Augenschmaus: “ instead of a Fußbodens bathrooms has a surface. ”
“ On the one hand, it is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the entire building. ”
All doubles look: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, Sprungbretter.
The “ kleinformatige Bildband Badefreuden ” gives to 190 Wissenswertes sides on the architecture and cultural history of historic promotion - oases but above all an appetite for a leap in the blue.
Remarkable copies discovered the pools Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100 - year - old Széchenyi - it was a bad in Budapest nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc - Tapolca), as well as an Thermalbad, whose basin alkalihaltigem were filled with water and is in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, on the other hand, provide many districts Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city, in a Außenpool Bads in St. Anton on the covered Arlberg look - and in the Dampfbad: there is a window, from which it the flow on the ski runway can monitor.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool - design expects beach in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquadome looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
From three to open the peel dampft it in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the pool - Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smelt sulphur, after the Árpád - bath in the hungarian Békescsaba smell it is so much for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe, in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell is coming from the alkali - hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal waters, almost black, and whose silt a stain on the skin, as soon as it is sliding into the pool, a promotion - a special kind of.
In one place, iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing, however, also disappointed: the free - and in the czech Sonnenbad bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, it was a abgesperrtes terrain.
The 1902 - designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bad has since been closed.
As Meder look verwitterten through the window of the red - and - white - yellow building Jugendstil - raised her, like weeds between the Fliesen has grown.
The drop has addressed it, on the other hand, turning in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais made in Wildbad bad.
Three construction schedules, this bad already; discover you can not only neoromanische elements from moments of its construction in 1844, but also a maurische warehouse in the Alhambra - style, in 1900 added.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995, the Palais made the Lieblingsbad the pool knowledge iris Meder - and not just because they had originated in the Black Forest.
“ It is quite an achievement, as various Baustile at such a wonderful unity to merge, ” says Meder.
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in Thermalpool appear to be beside the point.
