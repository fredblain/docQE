EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten eurosceptics and
“ The Lisbon Treaty, the balance between the various institutions felt from the order. ”
I would not have expected that such a hard war flares. ”
“ There will be five to six years, until the dust settles and all with their new role have become used to be, ” began girl Milena Vicenová, the czech ambassador to the European Union, quite strongly their lecture at the law school.
How seriously it the motto “ understandable and openly about Europe ”, it has shown in the first part of their lecture, in which it was able to the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that some of his editor, the faculty of the Karlsuniversität therefore have envy.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new permanent Chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
“ Initially, according to criticism that it is too quietly - a grey official who is such a role not up, but I have to say that it has all the short, how well it is the issue.
“ He is a person of the 27 member states, it will listen patiently, communicate with and the particularly clear idea of, as it is with the EU is to continue.
The new position of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said the answer to the question: who is the really - the European Union? what number should I call? ”, in other words, as an important step to agreement and better visibility of the EU 's policy towards states, such as China and India.
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda, in accordance with the European Union, and lives in the near future to live.
The czech presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had the financial crisis and the faltering and gas crisis summits for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the presidency describing it as a great Negativum, the image of the Czech Republic much damage.
The czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said, it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which has still not been overcome, quite hectic.
And there is still the seven - year EU budget is approved, but the matter because of today 's economic situation is much more complicated.
Whether or not it is a slim and Thrifty budget, which industries take precedence, which countries more or less will all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which it came to Brussels: “ understandable on Europe ”.
“ If there is one thing I do not like, then it is gräuliche acronym, concepts and technical jargon, which no one understands.
How can I as citizens actually know whether Brussels really curly or round cucumbers and variable invented just bananas or whether we actually someone Quargel wants to ban.
It would have the soil of the EU also would like to be used more Czechs in european institutions.
The two - speed Europe or different prospect in
According to the EU Ambassador the Czechs have a reputation for eurosceptics, to be, the more the negative, the positive side of the matter.
Even more galling is the poor representation by the Czechs in european institutions.
There are many factors, including the restraint of our candidates, their inability to Motivierungsbriefe to write and, last but not least, the weak support the czech side.
In addition to the successful czech presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, called the V4.
“ Do you think if a Pole or hungarian come to me and a Slovak in the vicinity, says the Frenchman next to me: “ Hey, what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4? ” and will not make a fairly acid straight face.
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a “ european ” is the idea of a Europe of the two, or even at different speeds.
“ We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the eurozone.
“ We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute a bestärkten cooperation. ”
“ For the first time, it was said that the only countries to work together who want it and those who do not want to let stand aside. ”
“ There will be more and more of these institutions, which, in the end, on a strong “ a multi - speed Europe ”, ” Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this respect, it also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues with the impact on the whole of the EU by all member states must be discussed and not just by the countries of the euro zone.
