The worst female vices: what 's with you?
If the men calling on some typical female vices, then shake it would invariably some paint from the sleeves.
Women, you would see in the following lines, in which a few Unsitten review, which the men the blood wallen?
Einkaufssucht
Raises them their s husband, einkaufssüchtig?
You have to be at least one reunite on a weekly basis?
Do you like to shop and in operations there must also be a bit more?
Then it is in your case is really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware and try their Einkaufslust reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, which Ms believes it has already, in search of a well - seated Oberbekleidung only through a Kleidergeschäft to bummeln and not all (in all kinds of Farbkombinationen) in the booth to try?
Even if the shopping for the majority of women is a hobby, for men, it is often the pure hell.
Consider it just as often, her husband said, it is better you out there …
Constant discontent
“ I am not getting too fat? ”
“ I should at least five kilos of decline, should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik? ”
“ I Gefalle you? ”
They sounds familiar?
Yes?
That will take you to the women, the obsession of them are, how they look.
That is by no means that you will be allowed, but many men respond allergic to when their Mrs constantly about their appearance upset.
The stronger sex is agreed, with increasing frequency of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a tilting at windmills.
The spills Fliesen windows, and dust, the Wanne scheuern - and it at least twice a week.
Berate you with their partner, because he once again with dirty shoes on the clean Fliesen trample, chastising the children, because it just gescheuerte Waschbecken dreckig once again, and because the Glastür on Wohnzimmerschrank again fingerprints, which the whitening so much trouble?
Should you under this kind of “ Devianz ”, then you should know that there is no exaggeration, and the order and cleanliness in family life not in the first place.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can at the end of the day, the mutual relations and, above all, the peace in the family.
Sticheln
“ Dirty Turnhosen come in the Wäschekorb. ”
“ You want the old socks really tomorrow again attract? ”
“ A watery throwing is not simply on the floor. ”
If her partner such a tirade is exposed, you may not be surprised to see him at the Palme.
Clearly, this is not bad, but they want to do just that everything is in order.
If the men know this, then took the women may not be as much to meckern.
Gossip
Some women like to clap and tratschen, as is behind the backs of getuschelt or even be vilified or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relations, therefore, they would like to such issues by, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think any of us has a harmless bit of gossip to camp.
Believe me, this is all women.
But that is not to be confused with the major Klatschtanten calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, who are all in their area and contempt for the particularly Frauenkollektive represent a significant danger.
