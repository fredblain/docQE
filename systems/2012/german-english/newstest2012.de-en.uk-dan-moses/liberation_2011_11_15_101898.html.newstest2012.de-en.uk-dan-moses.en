Energy policy:
Facts about dogmas should win
There is a matter that is not on the basis of short - term considerations or emotions cannot be dealt with, it is, of course, the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity influence in direct Maβe purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It is reasonable to Wahltreffen a reason to take on this issue, as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit, if they all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data footing.
Although 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by the year 2050, is not a huge share of the world 's population at a vital element to give up.
At the same time, it must be the scarcity of fossil resources, in order to continue consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, of course, from the environmental debate lost subject to forget to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany continue in its isolation, on nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which his decision, the need for a substitutionsfähige Ersatzquelle, nor in Switzerland that is barely intends to only nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, are just a few of the States, to continue to pursue their projects against it with determination.
The United States, for their part, have decided their Park after Fukushima, another, by after the Three Mile Island nuclear accident set aside to work again in operation.
Even at the renewable energy sources, and german model occasionally as an example, is, however, the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in the passed, one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, an increase in the gas - and coal - fired power stations - made CO2 emissions.
The whole of this unfortunate effects will be within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, european Tabellenführer on wind energy, from which it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, in turn used with wind energy, which are its CO2 Ausstösse, as well as his Elektrizitätspreis around 65% and 50% higher than the european average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbors in contrast to our french households by 40% higher Elektrizitätsrechnung.
As the price of energy in the global economy a key role of competitiveness, as well as a Stabilitätspfand industry at home ground, the french companies because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in the use of nuclear power would be a strong increase in electricity, which the noble statements about the re - industrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of the illusion will liesse.
Polls showed that a price is the very broad, the majority of the french nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of the energy source.
Let us remind us that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs.
Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings it a whole lot of specialised of small and medium - sized enterprises on international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs.
France should the decision to exit from nuclear power, as would a Groβteil these SMES are victims, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced.
What an electrician would work to sixty years designed EPR if the decline in its producers is pre - ordained?
The energy equation to resolve we must accept that it was also a little like the work of the devil a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
Developed by the company Areva, low - carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level to maintain for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing works such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their Arbeitsteams, which, because of their professionalism made a name, are from the Sicherheitsvorstellung just obsessed.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has three serious accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, is under normal operating conditions; so was he without consequences for people and the environment.
At Chernobyl, the drama and Reaktorkonstruktion unendschuldbares, human error caused.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry is also the lessons to learn from this accident, as it did after the two previous had done.
As a result of this process, and the cooperation of the security forces of the french and german operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR, a draft of the resistance to such things.
Under the Elektrotechnikern as desirable is considered a nuclear power plant to build, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition by EDF and Areva, giving them free rein liesse, the lead in the inevitable Kernkraftentwicklung to reissen.
It is necessary and legitimate, the best Energiebouquet for our country to seek, however, it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogma and Parteimanöber a debate to dominate so economic, social and financial situation of the country determined.
