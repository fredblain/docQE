The union also complained that the head of the High - all with the language in a memo in the bottle, which led to the dismissal of the Betreuungskoordinatoren approved.
The memo used the word “ excess ”, to describe the act, even if “ excess ” (german): send in the United States usually the change of practitioners of the payroll a school in a pool of available workers to describe the central office will be paid for.
“ Sechsundsechzig Betreuungskoordinatoren have been laid off, not to, ” says the Klageentwurf.
