Controversial plan will be revised after an oil pipeline hazards caused by delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which is the union is angry, while environmentalists reassured that the pipeline be built companies trying to plan the project again, so you can return to normalcy.
Trans-Canada said on Monday that it will redirect the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in Parliament House from Nebraska.
Alex said Pourbax Trans Canada that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course.
This occurred after an announcement by the State Department in the past week, after which would be to postpone a decision on a federal approval for the project was reviewed by the new potential gradient that the area of ​​the Sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a In large water supply shun.
&quot;This is a real step forward,&quot; said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which ordered the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a matter for the Foreign Ministry and said to his support.
The 1700 Canada-mile pipeline was connected to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets, they love it because they appreciate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the Nebraska lawmakers who oppose the plan, weigh the laws to force a move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but says the source of energy that the home inspector of the Ministry, a separate probe of the review process has requested that focuses on two questions .
One is whether a lobbyist who was hired by Trans Canada, Paul Elliott, who in 2008 was adviser to Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was contracted to conduct the original study, an inappropriate choice, as it was available in conjunction with the Trans Canada.
