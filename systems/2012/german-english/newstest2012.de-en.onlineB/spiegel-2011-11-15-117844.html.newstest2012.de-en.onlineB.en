Agricultural speculation
German bank can illuminate commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank on their business in agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the effects of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO wants to draw the conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the Germans, the matter is clear: in 84 percent of Germans, according to a study is not acceptable for banks to speculate in agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of respondents did require that off the German bank and other financial institutions from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa opinion poll commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, presented in mid-October the Food Watch.
In it, Harald Schumann, the author shows that the bets on global commodity exchanges to drive up prices - and the banks therefore bear the blame on global hunger problem.
The campaign is aimed specifically consumer protection against German Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to act similarly.
Originally commodity bets were intended to protect dealers against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts are agreed that the gambler is decoupled from supply and demand have - and make profits at the expense of the poor.
Unlike U.S. rival Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to look into the allegations and said that no business be it &quot;well worth adding to the reputation of the German bank at risk.&quot;
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an International Working Group is examining the allegations in the Food Watch report.
By the end of the year, the examination to be completed, then the results of the management board of Deutsche Bank will be presented - along with recommendation on how to handle it.
The end of January will notify the head of the bank then the action it takes.
In the end, could be a reduction of the raw materials business, or even the complete abandonment.
Ackerman is working on its image
Foodwatch head Thilo Bode, welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: &quot;The betting on rising prices of food shows very dramatically, as banks recklessly injure the common good today.&quot;
Ackerman is a top banking lobbyist now a special responsibility.
&quot;The German bank has to remove all equipment from its portfolio, bets where money is used on food prices,&quot; said Bode.
&quot;Whether Mr. Ackermann to starving people, or to the reputation of Deutsche Bank does.&quot;
The insight comes from Ackermann at first sight surprising, but it is clear that the CEO would like to make a few months before his departure from office a perfect picture.
On Monday, the German bank announced that the CEO will not go exactly as planned to the board.
With a shift away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And he needs to potential losses is hard to shave - so that eventually his successor would have to do.
Second Commodity Systems Everyone would terminate
Food Watch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager up.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign, the organization took part.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people surveyed.
Just eleven percent regard it as legitimate for the German bank offers facilities which will be placed on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Every second person would announce the survey to all systems in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would discourage friends from such a bank, 49 percent said they think about it, to terminate your account and go to another institution.
