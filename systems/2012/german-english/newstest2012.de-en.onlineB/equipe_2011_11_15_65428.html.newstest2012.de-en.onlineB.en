Hazard: &quot;How lucky&quot;
Even before the &quot;Blue Tuesday nights (20:45 clock) defied, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had their pleasure that they brought the friendly match, not conceal.
It would be too much to claim that there was a secret understanding between them, but the image speaks volumes symbolic.
Side by side on the podium of the spectators were seated George Stade de France and Eden Hazard Leekens well and happy to make peace.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his player&#39;s attack against Turkey, the Belgian national team coach had nothing but praise harvested about his person.
&quot;I am very satisfied with Eden, its progress and the fact that he is Belgian.&quot;
&quot;I want to look forward,&quot; the native of Lille, in turn assured.
As for the contrast between his statement in club and national team, &quot;It is a unity that justifies everything.&quot;
&quot;In Lille I am throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s time for me to go to the Start.&quot;
Hazard is coming to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France, at last, &quot;to shine&quot;.
Without fail, however, to the grade of &quot;pleasure&quot;.
The French national team he cheered since the age of 7 years, his victorious campaigns he led between 1998 and 2000.
&quot;I was always supported,&quot; he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to significant improvements in the &quot;unique&quot; nature of this encounter even more.
So much in advance: &quot;Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) it will be,&quot; he recalls.
&quot;We&#39;re just crossed my path.&quot;
&quot;Playing against them may mean groÎ²es luck!&quot;
Leekens left his hand with kindness &quot;pride&quot; which suggests.
&quot;The pride of being a gala match&quot; unsubscribe.
&quot;Pride&quot; also - in his capacity as a &quot;neighbor&quot; - to confirm that France &quot;has become a team at a very high level,&quot; and little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
&quot;Laurent Blanc has done a damn good job,&quot; he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European Championships, so the technician does very well with the plane of the Blue (the French national team) share ... namely to Brazil in 2014.
&quot;We come out small Belgian Large Cap,&quot; he said.
&quot;We are going to plan a thing, the players are ambitious, they are hungry.&quot;
&quot;You will notice in the upcoming games.&quot; The game against France involved.
