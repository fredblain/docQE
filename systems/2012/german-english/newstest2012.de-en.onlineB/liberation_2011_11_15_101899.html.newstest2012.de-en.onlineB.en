Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Guided by Nicolas Sarkozy, immigration policy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative organs because of the numbers subject to policy, compatibility of this policy with the status of a &quot;state of human rights&quot;, as had France itself entitled.
Recently, the students directed against foreign harassment by the authorities, the newsreels had coined the Home Secretary had casually (see Libération, 23 May) announced that France &quot;no talent, masons and waiters from abroad was necessary.&quot;
But this policy was rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
On this subject two countries have a broad consensus between right and left.
From the right side of the sound of Jacques Chirac was struck, which had declared in 1976 that &quot;are likely to represent 900 000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, not a problem for a country,&quot; from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990, France &quot;could not hold the entire world poverty.&quot;
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of invasion by hordes of Polish national soil plumber was divided in 2005, both from right and left.
From both camps, immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that is to admit the immigrants to willing.
Francois Hollande, is limited in its program to banalities, indicating co-development allow it to solve our &quot;immigration problem&quot;.
This conception of immigration as a burden, a problem may possibly affect the elections, but it is economically costly.
Like us, the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent work realize that the latest findings concerning sums of Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.) among the specialists, a broad consensus exists regarding the positive influence of the immigrant tide of economic growth, wages and employment in host countries.
The limiting immigration would undermine the growth and harm the labor market situation.
The fears over the impact of migrants is based on the idea that this threatens the local workforce, especially the less qualified to substitute, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much better than they did as the native laborers, because they carry schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors that are underutilized job technically.
The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that local laborers little irritating, the more skilled immigrants to work in the most dynamic sectors in which the training is not the labor supply adjusted.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, this complementarity between natives and immigrants also causes a positive effect of the influx of immigrants on wages and domestic employment situation.
Giovanni Peri is calculated in this way that a 1% increase of the immigrant tide miteinbezogene a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% is bringing about.
And this without considering the fact that the immigrants brought in by the idea of ​​the diversity of creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion of naturalized immigrants in American Nobel Prize winners, were Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay and Yahoo founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to the social systems in net, in the European countries on average at a height of about 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years, immigrating to Germany person in the state budget through its average lifetime net contribution (revenue minus expenses) by introducing some 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to be the start of his mandate, the lack of intersections &quot;with teeth&quot; to bring about.
This said teeth, which should deter the immigrants achieved, however, exactly the opposite effect.
