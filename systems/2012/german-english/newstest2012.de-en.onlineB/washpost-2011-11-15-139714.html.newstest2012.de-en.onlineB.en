Mission accomplished, Congress ready to communicate regarding Libya
It looks like finally, as Republicans and Democrats in Washington had already come to an agreement regarding the riots in Libya.
All that was needed was for this purpose, the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi and the end of American intervention.
On Thursday, the committee decides on International Relations of the Senate a resolution that the Chairman John Kerry (Mass.) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is subject to, and Libya to the successful rebellion and the U.S. American troops for their &quot;courage&quot; praises.
&quot;This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country,&quot; said Kerry.
&quot;It is an affirmation of support for their democratic efforts by two parties.&quot;
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, arguing lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in Libya Mission to NATO.
In June, the Kerry and McCain in front of a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties and there was no vote.
But this law was on the same day by the Senate. In addition, the board overruled a decision to cut the funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
Thus, the U.S. mission fell into a sort of legislative purgatory - with a congress that was applied but enough to criticize Obama&#39;s approach in the mission, but not angry enough to finally pull him to the ground under their feet.
Then the indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August, was among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi on 20 October killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate is perhaps ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations &quot;congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation&quot; and &quot;praising the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partner, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their extraordinary courage and professionalism. &quot;
The resolution also reaffirms &quot;the national interests of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy Libya&quot;.
Will the new measures to ensure full support of the Foreign Relations committee received or will they split the legislature, as did the Law of June?
The latest version is opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar spokesman said on Monday that he now the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, it&#39;s the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every legislative term of the Republican Congress and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area, which is the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to get her to change to a vote, although they have tried often enough.
Good lattes change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments that were submitted to Congress and include a range of topics.
Some are double - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate presented - others differ only slightly from each other.
It is only in the Senate at least 15 versions of the balance budget amendment and a dozen more, the &quot;control federal spending&quot; would.
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners among the Republicans who want to polish up her resume - the opportunity to brag that they are &quot;written&quot; such a measure have.
The Budget Enforcement Act, passed in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators for a non-binding resolution voted to support the idea of ​​such a change.
About the budget, some members are getting at the number of terms present, the members of Congress can limit, while the Republicans pick José E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is, as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring template.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states reject this.
So eager, like the members to propose amendments, as they move much faster in recent years.
The 111th Congress submitted 77 such legislative changes. the 110th 66th Congress
The speed pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which more than 150 regular members suggested changes every two years, the numbers, the Senate library.
But they were not much more successful than they are today.
The last change is to add the - the 27th - Was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
