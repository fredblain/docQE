For your Costa Rican fans to realize a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware you what this means for your fans?
Costa Rica is a dream to play, the reality is for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it&#39;s been great.
I&#39;m the only one vacation in Costa Rica have been. It is such a beautiful country that we are still determined to stay there for a few days.
For us it&#39;s exciting to bring our music to go there.
I ask this because the fans of the band are shown completely. Experience the days of intensely before the concert.
What do you say your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years to stand at our side.
It took almost 21 years before we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for having waited so long to have and we are sorry to take so long before we came here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Does not that a bit of pressure out of your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have laid in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to have made us ready for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle. For this part of Costa Rica to the best country in the world.
As you&#39;ve come to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends are always down for surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, the areas are excellent for surfing. In this way, about people who love to surf, we have learned from it.
With an eye on the tour with their giant shows have offered many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we are also no limits.
We will try to give the best show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and give our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine boards and play over 120 songs can. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will play each, is not easy.
If we take two or three songs we have not played for some time, the repertoire, we can focus our better maintained and they surprise us, because we recall the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they might be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that is why for the audience.
This tour will celebrate its twenty years of your history.
If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has imagined, to play once in a great rock band, and the long and another 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We continue to follow these blessings and find it great, even now still together to make music.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world we wanted to visit ever want.
Things could not be better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has always been an honor to be among this group of big bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and unusually plentiful, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Now and then a band comes out of a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups come simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes, we always play together yet.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden we saw on their tour. We are pleased to still be friends with them all and we are honored to be part of the Seattle sound that arose.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed together for so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and well we take care of each other.
We are all close friends, why have musical avenues opened, giving everyone the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your relationship to fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made us easy to find a balance.
We make sure not too many times to be on tour, because it is too easy to succumb to this game with huge masses of people who love your music.
As long as one remembers that the people came for the music, you have to remember the fact that you are the music and what she has brought into being sure, not eager to be a famous rock star appeal. That has never interested anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we have very good written songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years, which had until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never released an album.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which are built up with the band and friends. When I hear a song or see pictures, I think that was an incredible man Andy and how he made me laugh. There was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, in particular, have Eddie Vedder and the band therefore chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from multiple groups, and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see what Las Roberta can offer live. This will definitely exciting.
Why do the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter changes every time you play live?
That&#39;s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings, and I think he sings the first thing he can think of.
By whom were you influenced as a bass player?
Of so many +
Among the first that come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, CJ Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bass player that I like.
How about Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, although it is no longer just a fad?
I think we all do not feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands that I&#39;ve mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that came up at the same time. Although they are still important today, I think it&#39;s great because it&#39;s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
At first their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
That&#39;s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the album, something that might seem frivolous. But there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive in itself.
On both I was in tears when I heard it played like Ed. There are very dark song.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your music and your artistic work and these two songs represent the clear for me.
However, I also believe that a happy person, and can still make dark music.
