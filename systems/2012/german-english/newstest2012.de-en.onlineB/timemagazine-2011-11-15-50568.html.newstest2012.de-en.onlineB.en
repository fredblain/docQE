7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which this week has been shown in a theater
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October compared with some of his Henry Ford and the engineering genius picked it out as a great modern inventors.
What to find Apple fans but perhaps most telling in the recently rediscovered job interview that has been dusted off this week before feature presentations in major markets, is to understand how much of this creative force business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who tinkered busily diagrams - a man who believed that many managers suffer from &quot;a disease of thinking&quot; that &quot;a truly great idea makes up 90 percent of the work ... [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product. &quot;
In 1995, Bob Cringely, the TV series &quot;Triumph of the nerds&quot; on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat for over an hour, along with jobs in which they performed a rare, detailed conversations.
At that time had passed than 10 years since Apple had been forced out of jobs. And he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used to track specialists, he says, that the master copies of the interview were missing on delivery.
It was only after Jobs&#39;s death it was discovered a complete copy of VHS in the garage of the Director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the film 68min√ºtigen &quot;Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,&quot; which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the Landmark Theatre.
For someone who is well known that he abhors in-depth interviews, Jobs appears surprisingly busy here in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
During the interview it comes to four times longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering where jobs clearly weighing his thoughts and endeavors to accuracy.
There are also times when jobs come &#39;perfectionism to light when he apparently responded impatiently for him anschubst Cringelys questions and more quickly respond to themes or subplots of greater importance.
Taken before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost interview appears somehow incredibly far-sighted, if rated jobs, do what other companies he believes is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of computing.
It is one thing, posthumous tributes read the career jobs&#39;. But jobs here to be seen as the avid dreamer who is on the verge of greatness, something is very different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after this here is accomplished, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost interview:
How he learned to run a business:
&quot;Throughout the years in business I always ask:&quot; Why are you doing things? &quot;And the answer that you are getting is.&quot; Oh, so it is easy to make. &quot;
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks about things in depth.
I&#39;ve found.
Jobs will continue its efforts of, to streamline the accounting records at Apple.
Amazed at how costs have been recorded - usually began one with &quot;standard cost&quot;, which were estimated to be mere conjecture to and which were then matched with &quot;deviation&quot; - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the cost of doing business could be determined down to the smallest .
As the Pope was ridiculed:
Jobs talks about the &quot;blue box&quot;, which he built with Steve Wozniak, has a device that lets you sneak into the phone company and could result in long-distance calls for free.
About the unit has been written about much, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a paid phone, make a call and then connect from an AT &amp; T network to another as they grind through as many satellites as possible.
&quot;We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and if you bellowed into the phone, it was one minutes later the phone out next door again,&quot; says Jobs, chuckling.
&quot;We were young and we learned that we can create something for yourself, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.&quot;
Both of us, we did not know much, but we did not build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an incredible lesson and I do not think it would be without Apple.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious trick Wozniak and he almost pulled off, as they in the middle of the night via the Blue Box at the Vatican called and wanted to speak with the Pope, as best they could while Henry Kissinger imitated.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak with American diplomats, the two had to laugh out before the Pope himself got on the phone.
As he was in love with the technology (and unexpectedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12 years ago when he was looking for replacement parts to build a frequency counter, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received for summer jobs part time job at Hewlett-Packard.
&quot;It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company that I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees.&quot;
Later Jobs was one of the HP employees who visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was &quot;the first desktop computer that was ever produced,&quot; saw.
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with the Braun tube, and I fell in love with him.
I would climb at HP as a teenager and hanging up on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times a job interview, how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career when he attached some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment deadline by thinking of only 30 days and had both the assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
&quot;I remember at sweeping arguments ... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, the $ 300 would cost] and I got up, went outside and found a manufacturer.&quot;
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we were able to build for $ 15. That was incredibly believable.
About big companies, the decrease:
Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions into stumbling and lost control of their shares advance.
&quot;Let&#39;s say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you better make a copier or printer, so what?&quot;
You have the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which ultimately lead the company and the product with which people are forced out of the decision.
The product genius that led to this monopoly, is from people who have no concept about good vs. products. bad products, cut - Crafts necessary.
This happened at Xerox ...
Xerox could have the whole computer industry.
It would have been ten times greater than can be that Microsoft could have been the 1990s ...
They got the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
&quot;There a lot of craftsmanship is between a great idea and a great product ... if you developed this great idea, it changes and grows.&quot;
You learn a lot about its intricacies.
You have to vote to make certain things you can not, however, electrons, glass, robot factories.
One has to remember things 5000, these concepts and bring them all ...
Ultimately it comes down to taste, have it boils down to is that people try to create the best stuff that people set apart and then trying to bring these things into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing the great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, curators, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Had it not been for the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
