Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with a worldwide optimism the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg of the two teams had missed the sobriety.
&quot;At the end of his 90 minutes we are a happy team and above all a Happy Land.&quot;
Paulo Bento sees already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him it is not the slightest hint of doubt that &quot;La Seleccao,&quot; his national team for which he was responsible for September 2010, qualify for Euro 2012.
For Portugal, this means, in fact, only 90 minutes bliss.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an enemy, namely Bosnia.
In view of the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated over more than an hour the game, but the team was unable to impose the all-important matter of the stamp that the pressure would have taken away from her.
&quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goals.&quot;
Home, however, in their bright radiant with Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident in front of an audience that would also heiÎ² be on the game by strike, even if the game was, of course, billed as &quot;very tight,&quot; said the optimistic, however, clear-sighted Bento.
&quot;We expect a very close match, but are entirely convinced that we can gain the upper hand,&quot; said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
&quot;We still have a 50% chance to be part of the 2012 European&quot; relativized, however, the successor to Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday the Portuguese forces in Bosnia to achieve a goal and win.
A draw may be the Bosnians, who also have a goal necessary to meet already.
&quot;This is a good result, but this involves some risk, because we have made no away goal,&quot; Bento regrets.
&quot;We will compete against a team that has the high technical quality and has many players with individual qualities,&quot; he added.
As in Zenica before the Portuguese had to exert maximum pressure on already at the beginning of the Bosnians to &quot;give them no time to think.&quot; &quot;
A good idea, provided that this time they will put into action.
