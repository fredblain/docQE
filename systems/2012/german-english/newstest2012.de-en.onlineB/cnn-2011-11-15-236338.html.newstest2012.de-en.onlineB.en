Urgent warnings from the Pentagon to potential cuts in the defense sector
Defense Leon Panetta heated to Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. So he set off a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian production lines.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts in the amount of 450 billion dollars in the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts are needed more by 600 trillion, or if Congress can not make a conclusion in the paper edition.
&quot;The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,&quot; Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would result in 23% overall cuts and a halt to many new projects.
&quot;Done Such a high reduction on such ill-considered way, most of our marine and construction projects would make impossible - you can not buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and hurt other modernization efforts seriously,&quot; said Panetta to Senators.
&quot;We would also be forced to involuntarily separate us from many of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly be civilians with leave of absence in order to achieve this goal.&quot;
&quot;These changes would destroy the faith of those who will maintain our military and harm our alert seriously.&quot;
The cuts were finally meet the combat troops, &quot;said Panetta.
&quot;During the war time quotas are in the fight against terrorism by the seizure is not directly affected, would be of serious interference with the basic budget, the war effort adversely affect,&quot; Panetta warned.
&quot;Personal settings have to be shortened, which would lead to delays in the settings and adjust supervision, support the war.&quot;
&quot;The salaries of the staff would be reduced, resulting in late payments to dealers and the war would be legal and political support to be disturbed.&quot;
The two senators, Panetta replied 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Department of Defense.
&quot;The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would begin a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world.&quot;
&quot;We are vehemently against this draconian action,&quot; the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they Panetta&#39;s letter published.
&quot;This is a result with which we can not live, and there is certainly none that we should impose ourselves.&quot;
&quot;The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Equip and their occurrence should not be permitted.&quot;
Increase if Panetta&#39;s letter and the new warnings of the senators the pressure to a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly blunt the possible cuts pronounced, although he was for many years to gain experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the forefront of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to.
At a press conference last week in the defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead - with a military shell, but without a core.
&quot;There is a ship without sailors.&quot;
&quot;There is a brigade without ammunition.&quot;
&quot;There is an air force squadron without enough trained pilots.&quot;
&quot;There is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfill the mission,&quot; Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
&quot;It is a force that lacks morality and alert and not in a position to take on potential adversaries.&quot;
&quot;You can be a really angry.&quot;
In an appendix to his letter to McCain and Graham led Panetta to new details, such as creating reductions &quot;significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our use worldwide and Eingreiff√§higkeit, resulting in an unacceptable risk to future military operations . &quot;
And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
To this list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that require Army and Navy, to replace the Humvee.
If you were to stop further development and testing of the F35, this would save over the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollars, but proponents say that it is an important next step in the upgrade, so that potential threats from China and other opponents can be dispelled.
