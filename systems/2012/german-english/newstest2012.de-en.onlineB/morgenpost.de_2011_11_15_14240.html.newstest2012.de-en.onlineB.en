Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered &quot;problem birds&quot; But from the cities, the highly intelligent animals long since ceased to distribute, say experts.
The one they like, they want to get rid of the other very quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but many local residents&#39; complaints are piling on the dirt and noise of the animals.
It is an antidote to the &quot;problem birds&quot; not yet in sight.
Rooks were received from the cities to not get out, experts said at the first symposium in the East Frisian idle crows.
There, experts from all over Germany advised on possible ways out.

Conservationists led it to back problems in cities and the rural exodus of specially protected rooks: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroy the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing development and the felling of trees made the typical breeding birds life difficult.
Crows are protected.
There are large colonies of more than 600 breeding pairs in it, among other things Soest, in North West, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in space.
There in 2005 a controversial project for the mass murder of crows in the county had provided for negative headlines.
Critics have called the trapping of animals in bird traps and the slaying with clubs as particularly brutal.
&quot;The normal displacement, the aversive conditioning, does not work&quot;, the city planner and landscape Werner Klover stated in Leer.
Nests with water airborn or fell trees have often undesirable consequences, also said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
&quot;The animals of soft, large colonies split up and spread to other places.&quot;
Deterrence would be considered only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
&quot;We have to live with them, we can no longer get away.&quot;
Without leaving the surrounding area, the problem is not solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner empty.
Conceivable is a combination of aversive conditioning of the animals from sensitive residential areas and bait advertising, in order to resettle elsewhere.
&quot;Information boards instead of chainsaws&quot; advertised, however, the psychologist and anthropologist Mary Uta Juergens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals: &quot;a pimple on the face, we can finally bear most confident.&quot;
Jurgens had in Schleswig-Holstein the Aschenberger Crow Trail co-founded information on the signs of the life of the highly intelligent rooks.
The project will now been taken by tourists.
Even the criticism of the noise of the birds Jurgens had their own opinion: &quot;Because a lot of communication that have much to say to each other.&quot;
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use tools, in order to get a treat, but make it as a tool tooling, even himself.
Behavioral scientist at Cambridge University recently tested at four rooks, as far as the intelligence of birds.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they must bring with stones a scaffolding collapse in order to reach a moth larva.
Without much training they knew determined what size and shape of a stone must have in order to bring down the platform.
In a second experiment, the crows had to be smart to solve a problem kniffligeres.
In a vertically arranged cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had them put down pieces of wire.
From all four animals formed a hook that allows it then fished the bucket by the handle of the tube.
Three of the four Rooks succeeded in this even from the start.
