Development in fares since 1989
By 1989 there were only five of the then Czechoslovak government approved travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, and Rekrea Autoturist.
The travel agencies selling trips at that time mainly only in the Socialist bloc countries, were allowed into the West at that time only a selected few.
And that Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and Hungary at Lake Balaton.
A possible exception was the period from 1962 and 1972, as one could also travel to Yugoslavia, then struck a pro-Western course and Yugoslavia were therefore severely restricted the travel of Yugoslavia.
A great paradox that socialism, was that it was not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia, for example, wanted to travel to Poland individually or even in the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called letter of invitation, individual trips were otherwise not possible.
Even back then the travel agent to also travel to the West, but then you had to take into account huge snakes or even in a sleeping bag to stay in front of the travel office, or at least &quot;good friends&quot; in the travel agency have.
Even so, the matter was far from gone.
The so-called foreign exchange commitments - the requirement for an exit to the West - has been given only &quot;politically reliable&quot; people - the others were not traveling at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was freely convertible currency that is not without currency commitments so it would have been impossible for the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to be found.
The Czechs spent so far away most of their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless cottages and dachas bought - a practice that continues today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the Czech revolution in the foot.
While all things were until 1989 a holiday in East Germany or Bulgaria in the measure, Czechs spent the last year, 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, which one is not aware of anymore is the fact that in the currently most popular tourist destination for Czechs - Croatia until 1989, could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of last century, the motto of duty in the neighboring Western European countries have been lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria, especially to and from Germany.
The Czechoslovaks were able to get from their long trips to the West just is not enough, everyone wanted at least a couple of days have been there.
Sun slept in the Czech tourists traveling to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would then have the money to stay in a hotel or a guesthouse had.
A typical feature of trips abroad by that time was a Czechs with canned goods, beer and sausage and so fully packed trunk.
Another important milestone was the introduction of freely convertible Czech crown - after decades of Western tourists were our currency finally free shopping.
Our standard of living and thus also the average salaries have risen, which in 1997 einmündete important in another moment.
Due to the increased demands for travel, travel agents began after 1997 to prepare regularly travel by charter flights, making the air travel with the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly reduced prices.
End of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devise means of payment with all other highly developed countries of the world, which made travel much easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the &quot;post-Velvet&quot; tourist traffic there was in 2000 when it was released due to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then, annual direct charter aircraft to fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries and this year we will fly directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
There are about 100 thousand Czechs traveling to exotic countries every year!
Another important moment in the era that marked our &quot;post-revolutionary&quot; development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. lifted its visa requirement for Czech tourists, bringing our country einreihte definitely among the advanced countries of the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their first holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent for a single holiday stay at the resort including the cost of more than 15 thousand CZK per head.
