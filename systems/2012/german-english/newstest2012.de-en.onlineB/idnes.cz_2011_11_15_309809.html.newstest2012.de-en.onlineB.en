The menu is an obese child: It is not breakfast for dinner and eats meat
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have a weight problem, where 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of children are overweight.
Recent surveys proved - Obese children often come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
It shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human being is the milieu in which he grows up, and the examples are that surround it.
On the tables of obese children sausages are up to half of the table more often than in families living in those of normal weight children.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had the day before the awareness campaign under the slogan &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence,&quot; French fries for dinner.
In families with Fatty and sports is not one of the favorite pastimes, which also affects the majority of today&#39;s students - only 15 percent answered that their parents at least once in the week, time of active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted last year by the end of the school year, while nearly 900 children were interviewed from elementary schools in the Czech Republic.
That was the second year of the Action &quot;Obesity is not a coincidence&quot;, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
Previously participated in the project more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8 Some classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
&quot;Only half the children surveyed cited, for example, five times a day, breakfast-mode second breakfast-lunch-snack-food dinner - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet&quot;, is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor, such as the regular breakfast time, the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And - in most families, breakfast each by itself.
Worst of all was the finding that breakfast is not at every tenth family.
The breakfast is regarded as the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test brought to light, among other things, that in families of obese children consumed more often unhealthy fries.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight again - drinking sweet sodas each day (70 percent)
While driving more than 40 percent of the children&#39;s sports, but only less than half of their parents do - namely, only 15 percent.
Imagine your own menu together
Another part of the survey made it possible for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together out of options offered by their own appetite and think diet.
&quot;What do prefer Czech children aged between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite foods were many desserts, meat dishes and of course desserts.
&quot;It is alarming, especially the huge popularity of sweet lemonade,&quot; is emphasized in the final report of this survey.
At lunch, which is the main dish, pasta won just ahead of poultry.
Legumes liked the children and hardly even the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Turning toward the health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are willing to change their eating habits when they get correct information.
&quot;In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture&quot; Obesity is not a coincidence, &quot;filled out, was in many cases, a clear shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition,&quot; noted in the results of the project mentioned.
What is striking, this was the case with the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children crossed the questionnaire also much more than poultry or fish main course of the day and were willing to eat less food or sweet dumplings.
