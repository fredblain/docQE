Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous begins Peter Englund&#39;s new book &quot;Beauty and terror. A History of the First World War, told in nineteen fates&quot; with a long list of main characters, the one goes to the heart.
Here&#39;s a tip on how one might proceed: Carefully cut out this page and take it to your bookmarks.
You will get to know these people in Englund&#39;s novelistic narrative very well. And these people are the main function as your GPS, a beacon in those few moments when you lose like men and women Englund in the fog of war and stripped of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish journalist and historian.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he describes is not incorrect as &quot;a work of anti-history.&quot;
It contains only a few big names, major contracts or famous battles. There is no ambassador, racing reporter, and discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather &quot;a book about how it was.&quot; It is about &quot;feelings, impressions, experiences and moods.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and terror,&quot; the experiences of war nearly 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls to botanists and climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives to flicker like votive candles in a church, some are added, while others go out.
Englund&#39;s book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating trench warfare on the Western Front was.
&quot;Beauty and terror&quot; moves with expert views of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are beehives, a celebrated Christmas in Egypt among the pyramids, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is almost the beginning of a moving point.
The war overwhelmed the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, the smell of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is with her children at home, and hears gunfire in the distance. Stay or take the flight?
If you come at all?
Hardly anyone knows what happened or why this war is ever done.
&quot;Lack of facts,&quot; said Englund notes, &quot;were pepped with assumptions, beliefs, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.&quot;
&quot;Beauty and Terror&quot; follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mostly memories, letters and other measures already taken from published materials.
Their life stories can be scary or poignant, but they are very much alive in the smaller details Englund losing collection of moments.
Many of them deal with shortages and remedies yourself.
In the story of a German girl&#39;s school, he says, &quot;Spare, spare everywhere.&quot;
&quot;Ersatz coffee, aluminum false, incorrect, erasers, paper boards, wooden buttons.&quot;
He tells more of the replacement of Essen in Germany.
He describes &quot;meat (and was recently served with a false bone in wood) made of pressed rice and fried in mutton fat was tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes were soled with wood.&quot;
There were, as he notes, &quot;837 registered food substitutes that were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute.&quot;
Some stories deal with honor and valor.
An American recognizes his own urge for wildness and tells about the war: &quot;We feel that this is after all what was likely intended for men than in the easy chair to sit in with the evening paper or the seller and a cigarette and a whiskey hand, and to pretend that meant such a facade of civilization and barbarism, as if there were not behind their starched and studded shirt-front. &quot;
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he would probably die and no one take any notice or care.
&quot;When the idea of ​​sacrificing themselves, refrains, one might think that this is done before an audience,&quot; he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as &quot;a convicted man who was hanged in secret.&quot;
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart, and new types of terrorism.
&quot;The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition,&quot; writes Englund, &quot;a war between the factories.&quot;
He captures the arrival of what he calls &quot;a new species in the bestiary of the still young century&quot;: &quot;the word clever and convincing ideological mass murderer in the tailored suit, the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk.&quot;
People behave in unexpected ways and there are just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were trying actively to infect himself with a prostitute with a venereal disease, to escape the front lines.
&quot;The grotesque expression which can be found in trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to come into hospital,&quot; he writes.
&quot;Those who were really desperate to rub it in their eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives.&quot;
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves Englund&#39;s poetry supple and yet unobtrusive and fits perfectly to his superhuman task.
In dozens of short scenes he captures the way the war as &quot;uncontrollable forces unleashed in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred&quot;.
People begin to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually rather distorted as Paul Fussells &quot;Great War and Modern Memory,&quot; and novels such as Erich Maria Remarque&#39;s &quot;The Western Front&quot; as a comprehensive history.
Englund&#39;s band performs at an unconventional Hall of Fame.
His book has the most devastating end that I have ever read in a fiction book.
I give her no more.
But it is as if he had snapped his book with us this side of the main characters in his face and lit with a match.
