The Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details about the aircraft accident in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed and known.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of Communications and Transportation in Mexico) informed that indicate the findings of the accident in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed and that the helicopter with his whole undamaged structure is slammed directly against the ground, without the pilot had made an emergency landing can take.
At a press conference said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
&quot;The fact that the propeller blades had been in contact with trees 25 meters high, with the fuselage of the helicopter lost, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several contacts the ground.&quot;
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
He also said that the investigations in the field, on which the machine was run down, no helicopter parts were found.
&quot;During the search no airplane parts were found in other places, the charge related to the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, so he fulfilled all the requirements for passenger transportation.
The area has a bevel 7-30 degrees.
Currently the priority is to get the test results as soon as possible, but this could several months, maybe even take a year.
For its part, assured Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliaries (Secretariat for aircraft and support services in Mexico), the Estado Mayor Presidential helicopters flown on impact with cruise speed and the plane fell on a soft slope.
&quot;This information strengthens the assumption that this was the time of impact to a normal flight operations.&quot;
At a press conference included the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome on six relevant issues that should be considered in the study:
VFR:
In line with the flight standards it was a flight to the rules of perspective flight. This means that the team would have had during the flight and ground-sufficient view.
Weather conditions:
The AICM suitable weather conditions recorded at the start. During the connecting flight towards the border area between Mexico City and Mexico State went on a few low clouds.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team was selected because of the clouds, a lower area with a better view towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are the same. Perhaps there has been no impact from the loss of control of the aircraft nor a deviation from the flight path.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The available information to date suggests that the helicopter straight and lateral direction was bounced.
The pattern of the plane scattered remnants suggest that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the accident site can offer neither fire nor with explosive.
The last survey results indicate several surface contacts.
The investigations on the spot aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is steep and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is gone likely to break.
Some data indicate that the helicopter could have had several contacts the ground.
After a thorough search on an area that went beyond the roped-off area at the scene could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforces the assumption that the structure was intact plane slammed into the ground.
