Athens again raises doubts
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will not sign an agreement in writing
With driven by soaring risk premiums of the peripheral countries and wide-giving uncertainty to continue Greece lost in the maze that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the &quot;consensus&quot; of the new Greek government more of a transition in response to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces, is slowly covered by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Luke Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the agreed upon when he was appointed one hundred days were possibly too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that He supported the new austerity measures and not his call new elections to the scheduled date, the 19th February to take back will.
&quot;The main task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October,&quot; Papadimos assured yesterday the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will tomorrow be reached by a vote of confidence for the new government its peak.
A package of 24 programs to promote employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras concedes release the doubts about his attitude is not enough: &quot;We pledge to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing.&quot;
The Conservative leader went a step too far do with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that the 8000 millions who desperately needed to unlock Athens. He stated that he would approve any pledge of the fulfillment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is due to the impact of the poker game with Papandreou referendum or irritated always reiterated again yesterday, was at her request not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties, &quot;a unambiguous written agreement would not be signed as soon as possible. &quot;
The spokesman for the Ministry of Economy, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika &quot;very soon&quot; came back to Athens to discuss with the new government, &quot;which for the payment of the sixth paragraph&quot; in the amount of 8,000 million euros, &quot;needed was&quot; although there is still no definite date.
The Greek ball has threads for a while.
