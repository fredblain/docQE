Climatic adversities put a brake on economic
In the first year that is Mario López Valdez of the government, rose in Sinaloa, unemployment and illegal work, while the decreased foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
2011 will remain in the economic history of Sinaloa in memory. It is the first year, at which fueled Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and high hopes about economic growth, is in the government. However, due to climatic adversities can be no question, but rather a deterioration of the main economic indicators of growth.
The low temperatures in February, not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but put also the growth of the state economy strong boundaries and caused in the first quarter, a general decline in economic activity by 3.6 per cent This is mainly due to the historical degradation of agricultural development to 31.16 percent, which benefited the brakes on further economic sectors.
According to the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (dt Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) report issued on the effects of frost 582 000 hectares were damaged agricultural lands, of which 78.03 percent complete and the remaining 21.07 percent partially were destroyed. This mainly affected the vegetables, corn and chickpea crops.
The decline in economic activity has boosted continuously until November in the Mexican state of unemployment. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed in the first quarter of a rapid rise in unemployment since January-March had 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa is not employed, which represents 4.53 percent of the workforce. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent from July to September to 6.19 percent, 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa with the result. That&#39;s 18 more than 969 people in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa is the year due to several factors. The economist Gerardo Lopez Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the Autonomous University (UAS), commented on the politics of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
&quot;What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, liquidity, market losses due to cuts in funding by the legislation that was passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally amass U.S. dollars, it is not easy to have them work for you to invest it or use it for something else, &quot;he said.
Migration stopped
Lopez Cervantes pointed out that rising unemployment is inherent also a demographic factor.
&quot;The number of people who left the country seeking work abroad, particularly in the United States has decreased. On the one hand stay due to the immigration problems and partly because it is difficult there to find work. These people search here and work here, which in turn increases unemployment, &quot;he says.
Moonlighting
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one considers the high proportion of undeclared work. These include according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without pay into the coffers of Social Security.
Unemployment and undeclared work are the low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Government Agency for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa amounted to September 5352 pesos, which is very much less than the national average, which is located at 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
Besides the reduction in economic activity and rising unemployment in 2011, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) recorded the last ten years. According to the Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), FDI from January to June totaled $ 630,597, representing a decline of 87.74 percent compared to $ 5,143,312 during the same period last year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Office of Economic Development) turn recorded a total investment of 17.28 million pesos in 2011, is the foremost companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
Given the economic crisis, the government sought in July at the National Congress a loan of three billion pesos, which should be invested for the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities. The National Congress approved an amount of 200.6 million pesos, but could be detected on any of the industries in the country until November no positive effects of debt.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community was the first year of the reign Mario Lopez Valdes government incompetence obvious.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformation (State Chamber of manufacturing industry in Mexico) represented that were made in 2011 no effort to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the provincial government.
&quot;Economic activity in Sinaloa was really in this year was very poor. It is necessary to work hard in order to recover this year, lost ground and 2012, we have to work twice. The efforts of all and in particular the progress of the already well coordinated attuned Government teams are not been sufficiently coordinated, &quot;he said.
Slow economic development
Lopez Loredo said that events such as the frost made it difficult at the beginning of the economic development of the country and slowed.
&quot;The small business flow is the result of several events, including the chill. One of the most important impact is a slowing economy that is not enough in motion to produce a dynamic economy, which could produce an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, We finish the year well below our expectations, &quot;he said.
Appeals to redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, Chairman of the Confederación de la República Mexicana Patronal (Employers&#39; Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said it was necessary to the dynamic state induce productive activities.
&quot;Generally we have found that worked. We believe that it needed a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country to develop, for it is to enable important that all physical and human resources, Sinaloa,&quot; he said.
There is plenty to do
The chairman of COPARMEX stressed how important it was to develop a future perspective that guides the efforts of the government in better cars.
&quot;In general I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program,&quot; he said.
He stressed that the current state power have made progress in the government.
&quot;There are areas that can be said regarding the one that the government has acted more comprehensive. What I can say is, that worked and that the government is aware that a lot of work ahead of her,&quot; he said.
