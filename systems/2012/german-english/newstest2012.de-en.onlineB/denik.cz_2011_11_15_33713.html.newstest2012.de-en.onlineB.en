Libyan victory
The history of Libya&#39;s struggle for liberation or rebellion Libyan already knows their losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried at an undisclosed location in the desert, and without him the war is over.
Now just have to define the winner.

But - our lifestyle is now not even the only objectively and probably not the best fit and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.
In this sense it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters could ever help the infidel dogs.
May well serve as an excuse just the fact that the air strikes of NATO is not by any General from America, but by God himself were conducted, whose omnipotence after each successful hit was praised.
The winner in Libya? The West is not among them.
We took part only in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam and our politicians got rid of the dictator in the person of a political ally, without any benefit that would have entailed.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we have seen better from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus, the locals are going on a concern - namely, the expulsion of the Crusaders.
Do the oil companies but without the occupation of black gold at a bargain price?
Probably not, and so the West can finally boast of his selflessness when it comes to legal protection of human rights.
If they will not be the Shari ʿ a representative ruin.
