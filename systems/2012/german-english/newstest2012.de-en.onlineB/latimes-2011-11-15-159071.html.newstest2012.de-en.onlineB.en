Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon has claimed that supports drug dealers Fausto Vallejo opponents of the PRI in the race for the governorship.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost its bid for the governorship of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday, drug dealers would affect the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results obtained by Fausto Vallejo has the institutional revolutionary party, the PRI, the race for the governorship in the western state.
&quot;The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday&#39;s alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country,&quot; Calderon Maria Luisa in a radio interview a day after the election said on Sunday.
&quot;They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls ... you have voting booths occupied, roadblocks set up ... and asked people to vote for the [PRI].&quot;
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have struck just Claderon, which had led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a conservative candidate of the Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano aureoles, the candidate of the PRD left Democratic Revolutionary Party, the current lame duck governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-hand guide for the presidential election in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of Morelia denies ties to drug traffickers and forced the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which have focused on marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch in December 2006, a military-led offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence is still going on.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Maria Luisa Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear of the local elections.
The PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter how distasteful the elections appear also in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI is represented in the race for the presidency probably is Enrique Pena Nieto, of Vallejo congratulated in Washington and said, &quot;I think this victory makes us look boldly into the next year.&quot;
