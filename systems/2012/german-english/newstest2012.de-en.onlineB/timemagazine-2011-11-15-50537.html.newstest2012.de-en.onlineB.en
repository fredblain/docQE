Walls have eyes: As researchers observe on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Breivik Behring was just one of many guys who sent their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday had Breivik, who has confessed to having committed a school shooting in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent much time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists chat, support the far-right groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
That&#39;s easy - you just need to log in to Facebook.
&quot;We have found that it was not difficult to come to them,&quot; said Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank Demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebook&#39;s hiding personal information is encyclopedic, Bartlett says that the researchers simply have to use the advertising tool of the page to their desired demographic data accurately determine with scientific accuracy - as do marketers for years.
Bartlett&#39;s team found a half-million fans of right-wing groups throughout Europe and aimed them with adds, but related instead to be with a new band or a new diet product, invited the adds users to take a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitudes toward violence and assess their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues are able to more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries were to ask - without them even once had to leave her office.
&quot;It is a fairly new method of research,&quot; says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as no surprise. Online Sponsors of right-wing groups are mostly angry young, male, and about immigration.
But in a surprising twist kind of &quot;those who combine their online activism with offline activism rational, democratic and less violent than those who remain sitting behind their computer screens.&quot;
DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a hot new tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, political scientists and medical researchers use the site to study everything from health issues to trends in society &quot;likes&quot;, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, which add an average of three content per day, generated Facebook&#39;s &quot;data Supernova,&quot; a research boom that could increase the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title in the last five years by almost 800%.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study through this site people who would normally not reach with his clipboard on the street.
&quot;If you tried before, people to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.&quot;
&quot;They had to inform the first party and which was never granted access to them,&quot; says Bartlett.
&quot;If Facebook is this all away - go directly to them.&quot;
Others say that the site offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer students to monitor, for example, residential advisors, the page and help students when they postet too many status updates.
&quot;You can not solve a problem if you did not see it,&quot; said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno&#39;s co-author and director of Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children&#39;s Research Institute in the Washington Post.
&quot;We have found a way to identify children at risk, which would have otherwise found.&quot;
Facebook taps also constantly on the data of its own population.
The data team at the site has statistics on the relationship status, Valentine&#39;s Day, turnout in the midterm elections in 2010 and were National Happiness Index created (used primarily by looking at the information, which only has Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their should make large data repository accessible to others for research purposes.)
However, users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they like it or not. To a friend who is thousands of miles away, to play Scrabble, can allow one side to deploy their own personal information.
But what if the users of Facebook is part of a survey, from which they do not even know something?
While researchers have a strict set of guidelines on how they collect their data offline, online anything goes.
&quot;I do not think many people have ever thought about the fact that a researcher might study their profiles,&quot; says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study from 2006 in which he, the public pages of students studied on Facebook.
&quot;What they are concerned, it was all about her and her friends.&quot;
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the statements are true in a user profile and contributions.
&quot;What they say on Facebook, and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things,&quot; says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use.
&quot;There is no substitute for the real world go out and talk to real people,&quot; he says.
&quot;Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life still happens offline.&quot;
