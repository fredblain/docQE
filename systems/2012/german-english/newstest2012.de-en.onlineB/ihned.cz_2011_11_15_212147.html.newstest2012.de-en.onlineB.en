A few hundred students at the University of Isfahan in Iran on Tuesday formed a living shield around it to the core technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
So they wanted to make known that they are willing to protect their country&#39;s nuclear program, if necessary, to their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) presented recently in its report that Iran had abandoned its efforts to all appearances, not a nuclear weapon long ago.
Even in Israel talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then the United States and Israel announced the death.
In the case of an attack carried out with the intention to put the Iranian nuclear program largely paralyzed, would the Israeli press, from the center in Isfahan, the uranium enrichment plant in Natanz target.
