Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
If you wanted to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most accurate, then this would be the word &quot;longevity&quot;.
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, although since it was founded a century has passed already.
The basis for this longevity was considering her first boss - ing the visionary Thomas J. Watson.
He already took the slogan, countless global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit.
His slogan &quot;Think!&quot; became the hallmark for this should happen, the future life of the giants (and also the title of the company&#39;s internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM in the year 1935).
This was also the basis of carefully prepared Watsen corporate culture.
&quot;For us, of IBM, this means long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was so successful a century, because it has remained true to his principles and does not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform the course of our first century, technology, business and society.
We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, &quot;said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the Company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson operational as early as the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were among the first American employees paid leave to take out insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a elaborate system of pay for the best innovators and distributors.
Equally ingenious are the long-term relationships with their customers by IBM.
The company was brilliant from the start in the talent - picked as one of the first companies worldwide to IBM any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan on top of IBM in the next year is alternated by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
That&#39;s it for thirty years at IBM, so far they took the position of Sales-and marketing and strategy chief.
IBM makes in recent years so-called on-line brainstorming session from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, so the company is nearly half a million people employed.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this inward and outward.
&quot;From the beginning, IBM had more the concept of an institution than a mere technology company,&quot; said the Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
&quot;IBM is not a technology company to solve, but a company that helps business problems using technology,&quot; added George Colony of Forrester Research consulting firm.
As the company has stressed, there is a difference in the market only to be present or to mold him through this presence directly.
IBM - in the States because of its logo familiar &quot;Big Blue&quot;, is grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM develops hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product breadth - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the U.S. technology company IBM has the most patents and has five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions, for example ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or the floppy disk.
With approximately $ 220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second-largest technology company (just after Apple), and it the first time since 1996, Microsoft overhauled.
A look ahead
Not all products and innovations to meet the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy as the experiment with the native operating system OS / 2, the Prodigy online service, or the computer IBM PC Jr.
&quot;Business is based on the forward motion, so you can not be emotional tie to the past&quot;, stated Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem, its foundations built on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave again.
Unlike the Microsoft counterpart, which is in principle with its Windows operating system and falls.
Promising technologies
In the benefits of IBM participate in the greatest extent in services, software and hardware involved in each case to one-fifth.
This hardware in 1990 with a more than fifty prozentigem share was the most numerous.
Since 2000, IBM sold little profit abwerfende assets worth 15 billion dollars in the same time, however, it invested $ 58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
IBM moves into these investments continue even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time such a tempest over the world.
IBM, too, did the legacy of his first boss, Thomas J. Watson faithful, who rose in the middle of the Great Depression its investment scope.
So far it seems that the company IBM is today&#39;s crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares rose since 2008 skyrocketed by 120 percent and net profit of the company grows kontinuell.
The company slogan IBM is: everything can change - not just the values.
Even so it is hoped that this flexible giant masters, the next crisis.
IBM&#39;s history: From cheese cutter to Weltallfl√ºgen
The one hundred years ago in New York, founded company IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
IBM took over the name until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later company IBM put the merger of four companies, whose history in the 80s of the 19th Century back.
They owned technologies such as the famous clocks time cards for the registration of the work beginning and end.
The architect of this new company was Ranlett Charles Flint, who held until 1930, also chairs the board of directors.
And it was Flint who hired the head of rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so this helped him in running the company.
The leader then put even the founder of IBM in the shadow - on Watson&#39;s ideas are based to this day the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name implies, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machinery for the trade - of sausages and cheese cutters, to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he doubled its sales over nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually to all continents.
Watson was responsible for the company so indispensable that he whole forty years in the executive chair, sat until he was succeeded by his son, Thomas Watson Junior replaced.
Under his leadership IBM began to develop artificial intelligence work, and also developed the first programming language.
In the 60 years of IBM computer technician and helped NASA to conduct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn in 1969 and also the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer in 1964 with the same family of computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classical computer, the computer determined the standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 to the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, however, she bought the part of consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers and grew the company hereby fully and completely into the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of &quot;Smarter Planet&quot;.
It embodies the intention to use technology in an intelligent manner in less than previously planned areas, eg also to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently introduced the platform &quot;Smarter Commerce&quot;, which is designed to help retailers to manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM has a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - as ever the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM operates CR including a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe based in Prague, and here there is also a top world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
