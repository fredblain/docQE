Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City collected.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, gathered hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The amount in black tuxedos stood and applauded.
&quot;The servicemen and women were seen as heroes,&quot; said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which was observed among others by the Chief of Staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of different forces.
&quot;They were introduced as orphans,&quot; the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I&#39;m sure the organizers have been kind.
I know that
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say service members.
The public is increasingly behaving as if their men in uniform would do harm.
&quot;We were not victims,&quot; ​​said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, commander of the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will soon go.
&quot;But apparently, the only way the support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls.&quot;
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who are not ungrateful or in conflict with the public, who want to serve them appear.
They have also realized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War was met, was far worse.

After his two sons have returned from battles with the Marines warned the retired colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people could see their world outside the military service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider it with a sense of awe, as they defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there is a &quot;raging, violent veteran under the surface&quot; conceals said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over after his return, a senior government positions in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly inquired if he was able to withstand the same after returning from combat the pressures of a demanding post in Washington.
&quot;When you talk about your ministry, you have to contrast the negative impressions hold,&quot; said Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in the lack of American interest in the war.
Performance on the battlefield are from a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise.
&quot;We appreciate as a nation no longer military heroism as it was very common during World War II,&quot; said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, focus the praise of politicians and the public largely to the plight of a service member.
Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them or for the severity of their injuries.
