Darina on her unfaithful husband Rychtářová:
Iveta - that ass you can keep you, I no longer want!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it&#39;s over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtář (53) from protectors of Iveta Bartosova (45) had become her lover, Darina was still hopeful that Joseph awoke from his dream of pink and comes home.
But now it&#39;s finally over and with the patience for the other life, she has clear rules.
&quot;Joseph can come home, but not more than my partner,&quot; said D. Rychtářová.
As the singer Darina Rychtářová I. Bartosova had offered refuge in her own home, you probably would not even have dreamed of, like going out with her husband.
When Iveta moved back to her urging, after 30 days off and then back to Říčany, Joseph went along with it.
Yes, he even publicly known that he loves her.
Over time, resigned Darina, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband again - but now they finally gave him the marching orders.
Rychytář do not care who sleeps with his wife
When Iveta Bartosova Rychtář should leave it in the future, he will receive at home is not safe open arms.
&quot;He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out.&quot;
&quot;Not as a beloved, old stray donkeys, but as a man to whom I have some ties&quot;, said Ms Rychtářová, but she said that she had separated herself from him emotionally, and already there alone on mutual honesty.
The fact that he has locked the back door, Darina, Joseph wears yet with dignity.
&quot;The decision I respect my wife.&quot;
&quot;I stay involved with Iveta, it changes nothing.&quot;
&quot;My wife wants a paper marriage, and I respect that.&quot;
&quot;The company continues to run, I&#39;ll take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping.&quot;
&quot;With Darina I talk normally, but we do not share the same bed,&quot; said J. Rychtář (the leaf) Blesk.
When Darina want to look for a new love, then he would not stop them.
&quot;We do not sleep together, so I do not care whether she has a boyfriend or whoever that is.
I realize that this is my fault, I&#39;ve fallen in love Iveta and therefore I assume all responsibility.
