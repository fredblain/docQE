Military faces up to growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men are accused of non-intervention in a rape before a military court.
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Lance Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th Weeks pregnant when she was raped by a soldier colleagues at night.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend back when she met a male colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer with him.
He asked if he could accompany them for a drink in her room.
&quot;My alarm bells went on,&quot; said Lyman.
But the Texan brushed aside their concerns.
I thought, &quot;Oh, he is 19
He is from Texas, &quot;she said.
&quot;I wish I had on my gut feeling is.&quot;
A few minutes after they had left on Lyman&#39;s room, the man walked up behind her, pressed her down and raped her, she says.
This week, on 18 November wait Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided in the will, whether an action they have against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld charged , is admissible in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not taken against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, DC filed the lawsuit initially covered 17 applicants, which increased but in the following months to 28 months: 25 women and three men who claim all that they were raped by soldiers, colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to investigate, or condemn adequately provide law after the alleged attack is available.,
Burke says they follow the top military leadership, as the problem begins there.
&quot;The military is hierarchical,&quot; she says.
&quot;Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retribution? The leadership.&quot;
Burke also says that she has contacted since February, nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs say lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit as many other actions to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by Attorney General Neil MacBride has made an application to dismiss.
The records of the court that there Newsweek keep a detailed on the defense strategy in the first place, that the military can not be sued by current or former soldiers for violations, which have occurred in the armed forces.
Because of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries that are in active service soldiers inflicted.
&quot;The alleged damage incurred during military service of the plaintiff,&quot; says the document.
The Defense Ministry refused to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, so the distinction is only in name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan teams play increasingly important roles of soldiers, particularly in make contact with local women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in combat.
It is time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it is in their struggle not alone: ​​three additional cases are pending in addition to their.
At Yale Law School prepares the Veterans&#39; Legal Services Clinic, a lawsuit against the four major military academies because of alleged support of a misogynistic atmosphere.
Regardless of this collects the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America, a lawsuit against the military, is based upon the diagnosis of &quot;personality disorder&quot; concentrated, received rape victim, in order to remove from office - a common practice, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of Service Women&#39;s Action Network, a human rights group.
Your group filed suit in December against the Veterans Administration (engl.: the Veterans Administration) a, in which she accused her discriminatory practices in their handling of benefit claims for people who reported having been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws were independently submitted by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties, the Congress, provide a set of clues.
(: Office for preventing and reporting sexual abuse dt) of the Department of Defense 3158 sexual abuse appear in 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office was.
But most abuses are reported at all and considered by the Pentagon&#39;s own estimate of this number about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19 000 cases, which occur every year.
The report, published in March examined the prosecution rates: 2010 20 percent of the recorded cases were in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiff in Burke&#39;s case, describing their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman&#39;s case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she has been asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape, a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people said, as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator of which was ultimately acquitted.
&quot;I remember well the day when the verdict was read,&quot; says Lyman.
&quot;I thought the labor would be used. I ran screaming from the courtroom.&quot;
&quot;They took me to the psychiatric department, and I remember that I did when I came out, told my commander.. That was not his case this was my method&quot;
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed with a personality disorder and declared unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dishonorably discharged, so that they receive no support.
Whether the action, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed, is progressing, is pure speculation, said John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, &quot;In my view they should move forward.&quot;
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first asked the question.
I am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is lagging behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings with it a liability.
He adds: &quot;The odds are against them ... but it&#39;s important for them to try it.&quot;
These things will change only when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke will begin the lawyer of the plaintiff, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs in future cases.
&quot;We will fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform,&quot; she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
