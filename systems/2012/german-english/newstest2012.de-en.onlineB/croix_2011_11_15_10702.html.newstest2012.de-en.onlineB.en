Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and western Europe directly with Russia, was put into operation.
It will supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with flying colors.
About 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast with orchestral sound and gourmet buffet at the inauguration attended the new gas pipeline Nord Stream will link Russia and Germany under the sea directly with each other.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte of the Netherlands have symbolically turned together the control of the valve, which carries Russian gas to Western European network.
The new gas pipeline will be 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas per year extra provided by a first pipeline of 1,224 kilometers, connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is permitted to be completed by the end 2012.
And it already makes the eventuality of building a third line echoes to track itself.
Gazprom has for the timely and accurate completion of this huge building like a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed.
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide gas supply that is a direct to Germany, whilst avoiding any pipeline route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of their power: for them it is now difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close the entrance to Western European markets.
Warsaw, involved in most of the debate was not shied away compared to the Nord Stream pipeline with a &quot;new German-Soviet Pact,&quot; in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive The curative.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even higher degree of security.
But at the expense of a weakening of European energy, because the project has made a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has made it ready in less than five years, his vision have a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, the strong gas consumptions and go their gas reserves are running low, to enforce.
&quot;This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way,&quot; Francois Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gas contracts by political and economic side are important.
All this in the broad smile of Lubmin numerous representatives in Gazprom&#39;s managers explained in terms of gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an excellent technique.
The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating, they should protect them from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed at 200 m depth.
Had to be avoided when it was built during the Second World War minefields dating.
&quot;Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution&quot;, was announced by Jens Mueller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
HOT STUFF had strengthened measures designed to protect the fauna and flora to be taken.
The line is a long line of metal, heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is cut along the entire length by anything: neither valves nor maintenance stations.
A control was provided platform off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained, as the Swedes were a little eager, a Russian state company settle on a permanent manner at the level of their coasts to see.
&quot;In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute,&quot; specified Jens Mueller.
In the event of a leak in the escape of gas transmission, gas located so into the air.
This case is considered by the designers but only unlikely, since the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be from a leak resistance per 100,000 years.
The state monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot that is controlled for purposes of external observation from a ship, as well as a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt one meter diameter, is introduced into the interior of the pipeline and propelled by the gas pressure.
After three full days of travel through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the unit provides accurate information on his arrival on possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty long years, without having the slightest repair must be submitted.
The gas circulation is ensured simply by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access control, 100 in cash at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
The wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, here are the German companies E.ON and BASF&#39;s affiliated (according to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (both 9%).
These five companies have formed a grouping calling itself the North Stream and charged with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is headquartered in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom has subsequently leased the entire capacity of the society of its gas transport, on Twenty-year renewable contract.
&quot;Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter How much do the real amount of gas transporting fails,&quot; specified Jens Mueller.
The financing of the gas pipeline construction has been secured for 30% of shareholders as well as 70% by bank loans.
The total labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion € for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez was the total investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however gewiβ to recoup their expenses back, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas transmission occurs on a sandy, pine-forested shoreline revealed in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high gate valves form the gas outlet.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday of the terminal with one million cubic meters of Russian gas supplies will elapsing per hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
