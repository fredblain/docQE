Energy Policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
Is there a topic that is not based on short-term considerations or because of emotions must be dealt with, then this is surely the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power Measurments and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to accept an election meeting on the occasion to reflect on this subject and about the role of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if the totality of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French were to substantiate their opinions on objective facts and rational data.
Although 7 billion people are on this planet, driving the demographic evolution of a doubling of electricity demand above 2050, should not have to give a huge proportion of people on a vital element.
At the same time you have to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources to produce electricity can remain stable, without forgetting the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a vanished from the environmental debate topic, in order to fight against climate malpractice.
The accident of Fukushima changed any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains sealed for its decision in isolation, to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision to the need to find a viable replacement source substitution, even in Switzerland, the mere intention to build nuclear power plants, only the last generation.
Great Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few States have, however, continue their projects with determination.
The United States has in turn decided to Fukushima, annexing their park another unit by taking the once abandoned after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Iceland operation.
Even if that is focused on renewable energy sources, German model sometimes portrayed as a model, so, however, contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a price increase of electricity prices, increased by the use of imported gas increased energy dependence on Russia in particular, caused by an increase in gas-and coal-fired power plants CO2 emissions.
The totality of these effects is unpleasant are already being felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is a part of European leaders concerning wind energy, from which it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the largest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy, which links its CO2-emissions and its electricity prices will rise by 65% ​​and 50 % higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the stability of our energy policy to pay our neighbors in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bill.
As the price of energy is in the globalized economy is a key part of the competitiveness and a stable mortgage industry on national soil, have the French company because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in respect of nuclear power would, therefore, a significant increase in energy prices lead to what the noble statements would be an illusion on the re-industrialization of our country and to defend the purchasing power.
Surveys show that is a price that relate to large majority of French people is willing to pay as little as they can detect resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us recall that the energy policy of our country has made it an industry with 125.00 and 410.000 direct jobs induced build.
Because of its strong export character brings a plethora of specialized small and medium enterprises on the international markets and turning them into creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to phase out nuclear power, which a Groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and exports of nuclear energy would shrink more and more.
Which one would hire an electrician to function designed EPR at sixty years, if the demise of its producers is inevitable?
To solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is no more a work of the devil as a panacea for the generation of electricity.
Developed by the company, Areva, low-CO2 solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest level of security must be maintained for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security authority, the uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction is carried out in Flamanville.
Their work teams that have made a name for their professionalism are of the idea just too obsessed with security.
Within 50 years the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Iceland, has occurred under normal operating conditions, it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In the drama of Chernobyl reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error has been evoked.
In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters unprecedented magnitude was caused, which caused the deaths of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, as she had done previous to the two.
As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German designers and operators of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR is a design that makes it resistant to such phenomena.
Since it is considered among electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, would be a freeze in Flamanville a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by them could be free rein to seize the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development in itself.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best Energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate that is determined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
