Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the University of Mexico UNAM developed with polymer modified asphalt, the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and compared to temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the pavement, respected, it would not be required to repair almost 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of ​​the Valley of Mexico) erupts, said to Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt pavement geschähe appropriate to reduce the number of potholes significantly or even completely avoided.
In his lecture &quot;potholes from a technical point of view,&quot; he occasion was the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymer-modified asphalts develop to create a the asphalt-like mixture, but greater mechanical resistance both at high and at low temperatures has.
Nájera Herrera said that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some northern cities in the country, should be used to improve the behavior of the pavement and thus to avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon compound, is a part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
Viscoelastic behavior of asphalt means that this is at high temperatures close to 180 ° C behaves like a liquid at 120 ° C, it is very viscous and fixed at 50 ° C, almost, as it is brittle at low temperatures.
&quot;This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but varies on a day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations&quot;, said the chemical engineer.
The researchers noted the FQ, the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible pavement, which is composed is composed of six layers of materials, which included the last three asphalt.
Between the upper layers of lies, a wear layer of asphalt, which drenched from small, then there is solidified in asphalt and stones.
Each one of these stones wear layer, had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles are to move and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the pavement.
&quot;If it was modified asphalt, the forces would spread out even better,&quot; said the chemical engineer.
&quot;On the wear layer,&quot; he explained, &quot;a final coat is laid, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, ie sand, which was bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical strength than the wear layer and they must produce friction.
On this road surface most forces receives and distributes the base course also requires an adequate thickness and the material of which it consists, shall be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations are more important factors to consider, especially the water, &quot;he said,&quot; because it affects the behavior of the wear layer significantly.
If the ground is wet, water enters into the film and appears only in hard back. This causes a weakening of all layers of the pavement and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
If a pothole is formed, &quot;he said,&quot; is first removed the top layer, while the wear layer will only affect it. But the damage is not immediate, but it is a process that should be maintained at the first sign of appropriate maintenance programs. &quot;
The member of the Sistema Nacional de investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load is another important reason for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore crucial that the thickness of each layer of the pavement always be in proportion to vehicle load and the need to ensure that compliance is the avoidance of many potholes this regulation.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research projects were slow in coming, for example, on asphalt emulsions that are in other countries is even already on the market, and where the potholes were repaired easily and without using high temperatures.
