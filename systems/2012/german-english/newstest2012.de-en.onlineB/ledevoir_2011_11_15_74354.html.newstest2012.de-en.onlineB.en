The Canadian society lives in a negative attitude toward death.
Only 9% of Canadians can actually be one to talk to their doctors about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, where six experts were involved, which in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine, are linked.
This committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so as to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this choice is, and on patients who are considered able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recent survey by the independent company EIU that had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe together.
Although Canada is here on the 10th Rank has placed the study noted that &quot;death is the medical care in Canada produced a culture in which people are afraid to broach the subject of death.&quot;

Are now but according to experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries inspected, have their approach to euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, so the practical implementation of euthanasia or assisted suicide of incompetent or non-consenting persons would entail.
On the contrary, they encounter many more cases of such violations in the countries where euthanasia and suicide are not accompanied legalized, like yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.

With regard to persons who have already practiced an assisted suicide, which represented 41% of respondents considered that these should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or adjustment of the means for patients is to situation is less clear, the author of the report.
Also near this place in their list of recommendations that should be specified in the Penal Code, that the withdrawal of funds for a legal opposition had been submitted should not be considered as criminal.
The expert panel urges, moreover, that the health care professionals should be trained in the task to respect the cessation of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of criminal prosecution to have.
The Panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians working together with regard to analgesic treatment in order to provide the best pain reliever available, and this is also going well on the cancer cases.
Finally, the committee calls regarding the Canadian back in the institutions of health care widely applied means to relieve pain or lebensabschlieβender measures that could drag them to at least consider, as they nor euthanasia were used to reduce physical pain, they referred to the same procedures .

RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, the attitude of the undersigned expert report has among other things as &quot;extreme&quot; because they put the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages of any boundaries.
&quot;This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years to ask another person to him in his suicide help,&quot; said RA Deschamps, who yesterday had looked through a summary of the report .
RA Deschamps also emphasizes the report&#39;s authors seemed responsibility of the individual to rise above all other values, which are involved in social knitted fabric of the society.
But now, he says there are &quot;guidelines and obligations in a society.&quot;
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, also has &quot;strong resistance&quot; to the conclusions of the report expressed that they dubbed as &quot;pro-euthanasia-manifest&quot;.
