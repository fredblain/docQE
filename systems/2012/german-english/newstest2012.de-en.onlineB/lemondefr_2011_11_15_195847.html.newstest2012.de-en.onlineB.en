What the fraud represented in sick leave?
According to family allowances take UMP and now the government health messages addressed.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November arriving in Bordeaux to go to a family allowance fund and a speech about that - since 2007 recurring - theme of struggle against social fraud and economic dependence on the state to make.
To accompany the attack that originates from the desire to subject the economy in a hardness test, on the other hand, however, is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on worker absenteeism.
First, with household economic goals: the government is targeting the launch of a fourth day leave before consideration of a sick leave among workers in the private sector.
In German well, this means that a sick employee would lose without specific authorization from the company to pay for four days, so therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A Maβnahme, quoted by the daily &quot;Les Echos&quot; threatens to evoke anger, but would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And the other with a more symbolic character Maβnahme would go along: the state officials to give an uncoated waiting period in case of illness (so far there is to it, in contrast to the three waiting days in the private sector, no waiting period).
Meanwhile, these issues are under discussion, the majority also sparked anew the issue of fraud, is being targeted at the time of absence from work related abuse.
&quot;Checks will be much more important, and beyond these rückzuvergüten, if required,&quot; warned Xavier Bertrand on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this release regarding the reality of fraud in the areas of health messages out of proportion a little.
This is, in fact, since 2002 the subject of constant observation, as well as political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
Let us, however, initially at the national numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance CNAM in 2006 were paid more than 237 million euros days severance pay.
Pursuant to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health presented the daily settlements in 2008 with 11.3 billion euros dar. 5% of health spending
Under this amount fell about 46% of maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% concerning sick leave, witch means 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, 2.5% health care spending.
In 2010 the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 were granted on average, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group only 14.5 sick days.
An average of some differences glossed over: another was, in 2007 by Monster.com, site for career planning, publishing, pointed out that 75% of the 40th 000 respondents, French employees stated that they had taken no sick days only.
Another, recorded this time by the health insurance study makes clear that 37% of sick days were in 2010, of shorter duration than 8 days, 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% higher.
Compared with its European neighbors, the French workers tend not to work more than elsewhere disability.
One in 2010 by two researchers from the French, governmental Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) longitudinal study showed that between 1994 and 2001 overall absence rate (illness or justified otherwise) oscillated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20 % and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The sick leave fraud is a very small proportion in terms of moonlighting dar.
Regarding the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ achieved.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002, brings with it, that there is systmatische controls on sick leave in excess of 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public education for education and training of technicians and engineers) found less than 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285 000 of realized short-term sick leave, witch means in 37 050 cases of &quot;unfair or too long&quot; were.
In the cases systematically controlled sick leave of more than 45 days duration were counted under 1.2 million 11% of &quot;non-conformist or unjustifiable&quot; cases, witch means 132,000.
Altogether, this makes 169 000 &quot;unjustified&quot; attacks on millions of workers who have made a sick leave claim.
A number that represents only a weak Ausmaβ compared, for example those of the black economy.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, ​​author of a July released property report with regard to this question, this is 9 to 15 billion euros in tax loss of profits is per year, or more than the total cost of daily allowances, and so much more than the defraudation at last.
