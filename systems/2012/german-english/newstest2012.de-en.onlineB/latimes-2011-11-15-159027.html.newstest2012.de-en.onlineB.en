Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the laws of health, accepts as a court case
On the day of the gathering of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question of whether it will hear a challenge to the health law by President Obama, two measures of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner which was sponsored by the law firm that represented the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine justices came to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was treated to an action, 26 states have raised against the far-reaching health care reform, the last year have been decided by Congress, a bill that among conservative activists everywhere in the U.S. was a buzzword.
The judge agreed with the hearing. In fact, in March, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, which at the time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the law is to tilt will probably be Paul Clement, former Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements Law Firm, PLLC Bancroft was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group that is dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day represents one of the industry associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, to challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process enormously.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had deliberated on the case, place in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of health care reform
Guests at the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the Federalist Society events for years.
And that does not violate ethical rules.
In fact, judges freed from the Code of Conduct, which governs the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under the principle 4c of the Code, which states that: &quot;A judge may participate in fundraisers law related and other organizations, the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor or as per the program does not host such events.&quot;
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas filed two out of the case related to law firms and a company with a strong financial interest in this to alert morality and government activists.
&quot;This startling break with morality and contrary to the Code punishes the actions of certain judges lie, the Court should consider itself to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,&quot; said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a citizens&#39; rights movement in the United States.
&quot;The judges and won over a dinnierten Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending before the court.&quot;
Their presence and support of a fundraiser for this event undermine any claim to impartiality, and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have little regard for critics who say it would matter to court lightly with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society, mix.
And Thomas&#39; wife, Ginni is a known conservative activist.
By contrast, the conservatives argue that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance before a judge.
Your critics urged Kagan, withdraw himself from the hearing of the case because of bias, since it is involved too much in the defense of the law to be impartial.
Kagan makes no attempt to do so.
