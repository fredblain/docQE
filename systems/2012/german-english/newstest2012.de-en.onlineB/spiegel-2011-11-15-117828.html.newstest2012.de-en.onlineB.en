Europe&#39;s most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling in UFO appearance, ceremonial pools in Budapest: When traveling through Europe can meet a big surprise - and relax after a city tour or a hike in the tired legs, bubble baths.
One book shows where wellness is in the water at its best.
When Iris Meder in the past year and a half went on research trip, one could not fail in their luggage: her swimsuit.
Ling lying back on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, marble cherubs they swam towards the edge of the pool waiting for her, and marveled at meticulously restored art nouveau swimming pools.
Liked her a bath, she took it at once in her notebook on - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architectural historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her recently published book &quot;Bathing&quot; in front: public swimming pools in Munich, historic palaces, bathing in the Black Forest, &quot;hard-core concrete structures&quot; in the Taunus.
By 13 countries, she led her &quot;journey to the extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe&quot;: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg , Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
With sports, they did not care much, says Medes - only the water that was different.
Just annoying that fans have come to terms with floating blue tiles and chlorine smell, and joggers can inhale the heady scent of pine forests, or listen to cheerful chirping of birds in the park.
&quot;I was one day asked why swimming pools actually have to always be so ugly,&quot; said Meder, who lives in Vienna.
&quot;So I started to collect beautiful bathrooms.&quot;
Water surface architecture doubles
Splashing in the diving pool and sauna, essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great because all the senses are controlled, the Medes.
And when the builders have taken pains to swimming pools to be a true feast for the eyes: &quot;Instead of a floor in a bathroom you have a water surface.&quot;
&quot;It is both transparent and reflects the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building.&quot;
Everything is doubled optical: high arched, colorful tiles, stepping stones.
The small-format picture book &quot;Bathing&quot; provides 190 pages of facts about the architecture and cultural history, historic oases - but most of all desire to make a leap into the blue.
Notable examples discovered the pool collector Meder for her research in Hungary.
In addition to sumptuous spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Baths in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in an alpine karst cave (cave in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal spa, the pool with alkalihaltigem water are filled up in a bottle-shaped building houses (Városi Termálfürdö Jászberény).
Spectacular views, however, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zurich roof bath all the city has in mind, you can look in the outdoor pool, a spa in St. Anton on the snowy Arlberg - and: In the steam room there is a window from which one can observe the activity on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design pool awaits swimmers at length field: The Aqua Dome Ötztal just looks like a UFO landed in the Alps.
Three open-top trays are concentrated in winter, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool collector of the Medes rose odor of chlorine into the nose.
Many spas smell of sulfur in the bath in the Hungarian Árpád Bekescsaba it stinks so strongly of oil, which is hard to believe, to be landed in a health spa.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen healing water that is almost black and its a mud stuck to the skin as soon as you let yourself slip into the pool - a special kind of spa experience
Iris Meder was in a place in their search for great swimming holes, however, disappointed as they wanted to visit the open air and sun bath in the Czech Luhatschowitz, they found a cordoned terrain.
In 1902 by architect Dusan Jurkovic designed bathroom has now been closed.
As the Medes a look through the windows of the weathered red, white and yellow art nouveau building, threw it looked like overgrown weeds between the tiles.
Has countered the decline in contrast to a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases have already been through this bath, you can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements derived from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a Moorish Alhambra Hall in style, which was added in 1900.
Since 1995, the palace of careful modernization is the favorite resort of the thermal pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she is originally from the Black Forest.
&quot;It is quite an accomplishment to meld so many different styles to such a great unit,&quot; says Meder.
With such a palace of the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
