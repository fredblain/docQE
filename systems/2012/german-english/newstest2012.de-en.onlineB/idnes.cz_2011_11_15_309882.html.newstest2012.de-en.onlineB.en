Need for Speed ​​V: &quot;The Run&quot; - the illegal race across America
Review
Originally careless driving is a series of entirely avoidable, amateurish error routine trip to the morning shift.
Although it managed to fulfill the ambitions for the most part, but what good does it matter if no one had obviously want to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new sub-awakened with the subtitle &quot;The Run&quot; high expectations.
But he promised that even elderly game series &quot;Need for Speed&quot; move back a little into a new dimension in the playable demo examples, he actually seemed to be not only one of many action-driving games.
We were also curious to know what the fitted passages in which the main protagonist of the car rises and goes away.
But as it is already used with NFS, is ultimately much different than we had expected.
Sure - there are potentially quite decent arcade racing, but overall the game from a few unnecessary errors is diminished, which in this series are more or less been a few years present.
So there are really no more errors, but rather a sign of laziness in principle incomprehensible game developers.
The adventure starts out very well.
First one is introduced into the story, the main character Jack has some problems of a personal nature, the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America to participate through.
In San Francisco, then on the West Coast, you sit behind the wheel - with the task of being the first to be in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race will be held at a different distance and that the stages take place in different, different enough and interesting environment.
It has not a moment the impression that would offer the same game over again.
Some environments are to be considered still very pretty, although the technical level of video does not extend beyond the earlier parts of the series.
So, nothing earth shattering.
But the journey through the desert, through autumnal landscapes or high up through the snowy landscape more visually pleasing.
Occasionally, atypical elements bring a little variety in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, will be caught in a desert storm, which severely restricts the vision.
In the mountains again you have to watch like hell that you will not be buried by an avalanche.
By the way are pretty well built, the individual race in a row.
Although only a few, but they are.
For a while we tried so to pass the prescribed number of enemies (basically a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the clock), then expect a more personal duel with a single counterparty.
And to that interferes even the police who want to screw up one&#39;s whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack is leaving the car.
It&#39;s more about some interactive animations, where Jack runs away from anyone, and where the player must help him by pushing the right buttons at the right moment.
So, nothing complicated.
Not surprisingly, however, that the game is much less of such passages, as one would expect (well actually only three).
Ultimately, this is the cause rather an advantage, because this element has at least a chance of being boring - it belongs in the context of the foregoing, the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model walks in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, seen from today&#39;s point of view, it pulls out but no trees, on the other hand, could not be said, it would be bad.
Those looking for realistic simulations may need to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing the local drive model will continue to meet pretty well, although you might find the competition better.
Until then, if everything is fine.
Real problems emerge only after some time.
In contrast to the driving model is the collision model is not quite OK
Is a game of this kind can hardly be expected that it calculates complex deformations and collisions, but if you are practically no impact on any object idea how the car handles, then obviously not all right.
Case in point: When overtaking or passing close to oncoming cars, &quot;touches&quot; to the other cars in some places only slightly, in others, almost identical situation to get there but skidded and turned wild pirouettes.
Or drive the cart to the same crap.
Thanks to restart the system but does nothing further from it&#39;s definitely annoying.
The restarts are solved: if you have a total loss, or far away lands of the track, then looks back at the game the last clue of the route.
But - in every race you have only five restarts.
If you have exhausted it, everything goes all over again ..
The restarts are therefore more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but if you prefer not rely on it.
Sometimes helps but not even the restart, there&#39;s no alternative but to learn the critical section from the head.
Extremely unpleasant, that is the same thing happens often in the same places.
Some curves have to pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit.
Elsewhere, one encounters in the appropriate place &quot;civilian&quot; cars always in the same configuration, regardless of whether it later as the first or fifth, formerly five seconds or a minute is.
This is annoying, especially in situations when one sees that the opponent&#39;s play before a two oncoming cars pass by, but even there until you arrive, the car has been in a position such that they avoid or slow down.
And it does not matter when you get there, everything that is designed so that it comes close to this situation, always at your fingertips.
The opponents are even more advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you will always be overtaken in the same place the same opponents again and again regardless of the time.
On the craziest this is the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The counterparty must have a pass here, obviously hell-bent on.
And then if he is ever before you, then he takes a course, the point of view, so that there initial runs his own car a few times to smithereens.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and thrilling but this intention is so clear that it spoils the pleasure of a fast game.
And that&#39;s a shame, because despite a simpler model is driving the overall game quite entertaining and action-packed places so that you almost do not know where one is the head.
And basically do not care what &quot;responsible&quot; thing is - the concept of fifty unique routes, the location of the race in a way that can never get bored, or something completely different ...
An unusual idea is also to change cars during the race.
One must not overlook the gas stations along the route, since this is where you can change the car, although sufficient in most cases, the car that you currently have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the large American sedans for the straight highways and super-exotic sports car for the technical tours, for example, on the switchbacks in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game&#39;s story mode, and the tasks (challenges) - so the race in the individual localities, which are known from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile to gain that is common for the problems (challenges) and the story.
To reach the higher level driver, must be open to different objects: the car started right up to the backgrounds for your profile.
This is the same with the online feature Autolog, which compares with others their own results obtained with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible blunders is a situation in the last race in history.
This one comes with the car that is in a subway tunnel (I care), where in the dark on the rails long races (I care).
Look at the speedometer digits between 150 a 200 km / h (because of me), but there comes suddenly from behind a subway and an uncompromising drive to scrap.
In our editorial we will probably argue for a long time about whether it was a blackout of the game designers or whether we keep the writers for that stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is, in most cases quite appealing, and here and there, even brilliant.
Even more upsetting is that slow for some exciting moments, the refresh rate is and this sometimes quite dramatically.
This applies, however, especially the large number of accidents with Involve, where a continuous FPS benefits anyway.
The sound is far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to as wide a scale as possible rather just talk to young audiences, was a soundtrack a la &quot;bit of everything&quot; - but who buys such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need For Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed.
If the game would not be diminished by the totally unnecessary errors mentioned, we could say with great conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But as the game seems somehow unfinished.
For a great pleasure, but you should be prepared that this a bug bite with the power of airport lights in the eyes.
