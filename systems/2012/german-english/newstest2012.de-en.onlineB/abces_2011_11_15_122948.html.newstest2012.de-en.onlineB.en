Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% due to domestic consumption and end the spiral of the free fall in early March
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which is still in recovery after the devastating earthquake that lead onto a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that Japan is the second World War I had experienced.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage at $ 300,000, a blow that seems to weaken despite the difficult global economic situation.
After enduring three quarters if the information were used to gross domestic product from July to September to finally close this chapter: the GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and up 6% on the grossed-up to this year&#39;s quota.
The measured value in the second quarter - in Japan begins the fiscal year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained partly by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami which devastated areas.
In fact, the company increased its investment by 1.1% compared to a decline of 0.9% for investments that have been recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual change in the Japanese economy is not based exclusively Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build infrastructure or build new.
Woke up, Japan is mainly due to the development of domestic consumption, which now represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, triggered by the increasing expenditure on cars, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market after the Yen - Japanese currency - in one of the &quot;haven currencies,&quot; the investors who are fleeing from the debt crisis of the euro area and the gloomy forecasts for the United States, a privilege that such a grave stone in the accounts exporting firms busy.
With a harder currency abroad, the products are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is on the health of large technology based producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, traced their weak operating results from July to September, the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda.
&quot;We must pay attention to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,&quot; yesterday said the State Secretary of Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not really very exhilarating.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states have been clearer in September showed signs of a slowdown in economic development.
The indicator anticipates the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that would be pulled in the biggest economic powers of the brake.

The euro zone is even lower than this average, which stands at 100 after it has fallen by eight tenths of 99.13 points.
