Europe has invented democracy, is now, to think through the European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity, is also a fragile commodity.
The European continent should be able to even remember who it was invented in Athens for more than two thousand years the whole of the 20th Century about the tragedies of World War II, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also in Franco&#39;s Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Greece had the Supreme can endure.
Some had probably thought it was sufficient to exercise the voting rights, and indeed to see the most direct way possible, a triumph for democracy and for all of their enemies.
It is known since Napoleon &quot;the Little&quot; that acted it is a feature of the mind.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy is, is this not a sufficient condition, and can just as easily become &quot;an instrument of repression&quot;, as it was the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, public spirit, values, organization, control and separation of powers, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and foremost political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek true-false referendum would in this respect, revealing character had twice: once to the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other side, but also those of the unsettling feeling of the impossibility of its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered obsolete.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and that target the republican soldiers, or at least most of them, not in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to push for a national success of the referendum, which was organized in response to the needs and in reverse order.
A free ticket for the European autocrat or a jump blindfolded into the emptiness of the Nationalist retreat: A fabulous choice for the citizens!
No, we want to cleaver, but a collective task, from full right to clarify and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know the rest no longer to end where the bullet - there is only one crisis, and it prevails in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which bows to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from his swoon, and his lack of solidarity.
It is Europe that is humiliated on an international level.
It is concerned about transfer of sovereignty to Europe - this is Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and thus every one of his affiliated nations.
The urgency is to return the sovereignty of the people, the leadership of the European project to indicate the source.
Because it is situated on the whole, if the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debt, to free himself from the markets and a future through investments can initiate.
The exit from the crisis, decisions at the European level as a condition that can not be made without totally democratic Legality, without us, certainly to lead to disaster.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought a long time was urging everyone today to the European economic governance.
I agree.
But this is without political integration and strengthening of democracy - as envisaged by the citizens - imagine would be a folly again and another dead end.
We must take a new step in European integration us.
To create in the Republic of France, it took the fact to &quot;create&quot; Republicans.
The interests of the revolution could not afford enough alone here.
This teaching remains valid.
We need to form a more integrated Europe on an economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We Europeans need to create Europe.
