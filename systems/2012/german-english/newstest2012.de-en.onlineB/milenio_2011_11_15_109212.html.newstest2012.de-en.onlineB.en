Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy, to introduce this new government that the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse is to provide the forehead.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday named Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he is a technocrat is mostly present in composite cabinet, although not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the President the results of talks with political parties to form a government.
&quot;I want my absolute confidence in the ability to reaffirm our country, with these difficult times to be ready,&quot; said the former EU Commissioner for journalists.
Monti did not confirm explicitly the formation of the government, but from his comments it appears that the obstacles are overcome.
The &quot;frame is now staked out well,&quot; he added.
Monti has managed in less than three days to form a government that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt in an excessive level.
The new, guided by former Commissioner Monti government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was supported by the Euro politicians to regain confidence in the ailing Italian.
The pressure to rush bearing down on Monticello, was reinforced by the fluctuating market conditions, due to the Italian government bonds for 10 years at 7 percent interest was charged. This corresponds to the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti said: &quot;We said we would support this government for all forces.&quot;
We believe that this government is the last chance to come out of Italy this emergency situation.
The chances of success were Montis by supporting the party of Silvio Berlusconi&#39;s PDL, which on Saturday had to withdraw due to the crisis, increased significantly.
&quot;We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring about good results,&quot; said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed a majority made up of technocrats government, which just makes Monti.
Support by the Parliament
The new government needs a strong parliamentary support Monti for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts, or postponing the reforms could again result in a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks performs with his notice, failure Montis was a disaster, also print out.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers&#39; associations, as well as youth and women organizations.
Tuesday night is expected to close the round of meetings.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in response to the crisis in an extremely fast change of government in motion.
After a brief sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, are due to uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the cost of Italian government bonds again reached critical levels.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 billion euros, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government had until the next elections to be held probably in 2013, last, in spite of predictions that the politicians will just give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the preferred options.
Monti said he would like to take politicians to his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of engineers, an indication of their concerns about the financial markets imposed by the pressure of the process.
Political sources indicate that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the games, the inclusion of people from the political life more complicated.
