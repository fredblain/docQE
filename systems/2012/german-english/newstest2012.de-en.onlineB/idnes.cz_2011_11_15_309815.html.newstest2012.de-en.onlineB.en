Professionals say - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how to get stylists, I had a bit of grumbling that it was a bit too much material to start with.
Since I had no idea at all what is to come.
Presentations by three professionals from the industry, the apparel problematic characters and a seminar on how the &quot;on the square&quot; is running.
It will get worse.
The closer the test, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, he is still full.
This time we had a debate with director Alena (the course takes part, not a single man), how to dress a woman who has no ideal proportioned figure.
And after all, most of us.
Some people have too short a neck, the others are too boyish figure without proper curves and some chubby.
It is for the stylists to cover up broad shoulders visually to extend the neck or conjure the necessary curves.
We were also given tips on how to make a woman like Jennifer Lopez type - ie large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging attracts, without being too provocative acts.
If so great as the difference between waist and hips, the skirt or the pants do not really fit, you should at least have a piece of tailor-made.
This one will not regret it, because well-fitting clothes is simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt makes you feel that is much better than in an off the shelf, the high and constantly slipped, protruding into the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can get away again, to wear clothing with folds, bulking, appliqué, embroidery, or gathering.
With this amount of information and character types, I&#39;m glad I have time for a whole week, I leave everything to thoroughly go through your head.
And yet I am afraid that it is applied in view of the homework is not to create almost.
Each of the students got a celebrity that is assigned to come up with matching outfits for them - day wear and evening wear.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the corresponding figure type.
I want Miranda Kerr &quot;attract&quot; that you may know from the campaign, Victoria&#39;s Secret.
Inside, I rejoice, because this is for me personally a lot better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera to dress, which has in recent times probably gained a hundred pounds (okay, that&#39;s a bit excessive), or the young Selena Gomez.
The garments we should cut out from magazines or search the Internet, print, and then graphically edit.
In the &quot;mood board&quot; as the whole result is known, then come to our own personal style and our relationship to graphic design for print.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphical side of the styling.
The stylist takes the models that is not only physically, but also designed the so-called product page in the journal (according to specific requirement, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Of these we told the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the return on the Sunday.
This means that a stylist have a good overall view must.
The figure was with information on types of stuffed spiced same lecture Saturday by three visitors from the industry:
by Jan Pokorný stylists, fashion designers from Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And be able schickter stylist with a single piece of clothing in many different ways to work.
The magic word is versatility.
So you can wear as a trench coat over jeans as usual, just like a T-shirt or jacket, you can also wear it on the naked body, to wear high heels and wear it as a dress.
It&#39;s enough to roll up our sleeves and collar or equal to the whole look is very different.
&quot;Play with it,&quot; he said.
Most came to me but the next Council Situated: &quot;First you have to know the rules perfectly.&quot;
&quot;Thou must not until then she hurt her,&quot; said Jacob.
Finally, I realize why we need to cram all these theorems, which can be combined with what and why, even though you might see in fashion magazines often quite different.
Not to mention fashion shows all over.
Thanks to photographer Ben I know now that a stylist have prepared a lot more clothing options must be when he finally photographed.
So you have a fashion story with ten pages (pronounced ten outfits) to be prepared and make up at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo used in combination with other accessories at times look very different than in reality.
With all this so you have to expect in the design of the outfit.
The image and style, sometimes for half the success that we confirmed, Jan Pokorny.
Because you need spend only a Madonna, not just to watch a brilliant singer, have transformed the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a stylist more reserved about.
Even famous people often consider it waste of money for (the main thing is that I bring something, what I look like this is secondary).
And if someone already can be styled by us, then we should expect that he or she imposes on us are likely very different (smaller) size, as he or she needs in reality.
Then you need to google then only to establish with certainty that the tabloid press, writes the appropriate celebrity to have taken off again, or, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist to only focus on fashion and then the outfit &quot;assemble&quot; needs.
In his work he has to communicate, especially with the people he styled and he must be a shrewd psychologist.
People to assess themselves and are without pandering to his opinion.
&quot;If we ordered any manager to sift their wardrobe and to add nice pieces, then we can not dispel all her wardrobe and say - my God, that&#39;s terrible.&quot;
&quot;You have to find at least some commendable things for which we suggest what you can bear it,&quot; says Mario.
He also showed us very specifically what needs to include such a so-called &quot;space bag&quot;.
So that&#39;s a bag that is buttoning at the waist and in which one carries all the necessary Proprietäten with him.
Besides such clear terms, such as scissors, paper rolls for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils, such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps when photographing products, such as handbags and hats off), special clips, which is behind the clothes gathered if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing.
We need to listen but not only, but also to try something practical, we learned how to stick to shoes properly.
Even when shooting in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone outside.
O we are stuck and stuck ...
With the scissors you can not even touch the shoes, so they were not even damaged.
So you have to really act skillfully.
Mario pleased me by praising my &quot;creation&quot; with no restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is in fact not exactly my forte.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard during the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me - the styling is dedicated to professional level, is not child&#39;s play.
