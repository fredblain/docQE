21er Haus, Vienna
The relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history of ups, downs and a happy ending: The Austrian pavilion of Expo Brussels in 1958 was won prizes in Vienna to the museum, stood empty and degenerated.
Now he is re-opened as an exhibition venue.
When swarmed by modern post-war architecture is of clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwarzer for the Brussels World Fair 1958, a striking and famous example .
Schwanzer pavilion was then the Grand Prix d&#39;Architecture for his light and floating-looking steel and glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He was the architect so well known that the built up at the next World&#39;s Fair Pavilion in Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder engine house plus outbuilding schüsselartigem in Munich in 1973 he finally internationally famous.
His planned as a temporary exhibition building pavilion was erected on one of the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden in Vienna South Station, and in 1962 converted to a museum of the 20th Century opened - the &quot;20&#39;s House&quot; it was called.
Suitable, the building was neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, he is now called &quot;21&#39;s House&quot; and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night opened the Belvedere museum, which includes the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.
Enforced new beginning Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director in 2007, the Austrian Gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, Ph.D., art historian with a remarkable career including in youth as Eiskunstläufererin later at Sotheby&#39;s, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, rebuilding began strongly by politicians and preservationists, they procured public funding and private sponsorship and set usage.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba foundation of the same are issued, a café and a bookshop there should be, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation Krischanitz then was the ideal candidate.
Not only because he had converted Joseph Olbrich&#39;s Secession in Vienna and sensitively extended and won the competition, but because he has studied at the Technical University of Vienna Schwanzer and the pavilion for him a &quot;tremendously important place&quot; was where he &quot; almost every weekend, &quot;the exhibition was viewed.
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost when they move to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness.
With the current renovation it was much bigger problems: the building was &quot;a centrifugal energy,&quot; says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the window glass facade were replaced, used fiberglass reinforced insulation, replacing the glass roof by special safety glass.
Cold steel girder bridges have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been restored.
Two basements took place for the new use, a sunken trench between the house and street lighting provides the illumination, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors are still there, the house is in old red-brown rust-color painted.
And the cinema is even exactly the way it was before.
And all under the strict supervision of the heritage authority and with a small budget.
&quot;Often, a material had to be found, which is good and is cheap and well liked by the Archaeological Service,&quot; says Krischanitz and indicates a rough floor in the basement.
Despite the constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and easy.
Difficult it was to the Pavilion, &quot;was coming along from Brussels,&quot; has Krischanitz said recently that a typical &quot;drop-in-the-city story.&quot;
Such an architecture was &quot;always in the wrong place&quot; and would still &quot;give a true consciousness.&quot;
In this case, the 21er house is not in the wrong place, because it has occurred, an urban design opportunity: To the Swiss garden precisely formed around the newly proposed &quot;Station Quarter&quot;, with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck will probably occur even more: The 21&#39;s house could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz-building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporary bought art gallery, and we hear they been negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location the Swiss Garden.
