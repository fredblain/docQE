What was missing the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that Melina Ramirez Serna, the crown of Miss Colombia did not get.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Once again went blank from Valle del Cauca in the awarding of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band that identifies them as the new Miss Colombia, to make a show.
By that night result obtained in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar was in itself, the department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which held the crown almost in the hands had. The proclaimed Misses include: Miriam Benoit Ospina (1947), Clara Borrero Dominguez (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque ( 1988), Mónica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Aljure Garcés (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many ask today is: What was missing?
Because the result is the demise of a great favorite, who had shown at each screening, they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing was she the queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie was chosen by Vogue, title, and the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and who took the crown of Miss Colombia at home.
The first factor that is considered critical to the decision of the jury to nominate them for the first miss, is that they are the answer to the question &quot;What book has influenced you most and why?&quot; To it by Martín Gómez of Murillo been made of the Carreta Literaria Leamos was, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
&quot;I read a lot, I think pretty much in the literature, I think it&#39;s a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that shaped my childhood for most, &#39;The Little Prince&#39; is a very deep book.
At the moment I read &#39;Crime and Punishment&#39;. It is a book of universal culture, which we should all read. I&#39;m reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book that `Leidenschaften&#39;heißt.
One answer, which met with little approval, firstly because of the term `to zivilisieren&#39;und secondly, because they had not specifically stated, had influenced the way in which each of her book, she said.
But after the ceremony, Melina, to feel calm and happy with the result: &quot;The universe is as it happens, what needs to happen.
And for all people: Please read a bit of `The Little Prince &#39;. It is a great book.
Among other things, is said to be the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred, which reaped all Beifälle and had received in advance all prices (catering competition Easter, public vote on the best-made visual costume and Reina Madre), &quot;the other candidates had been jealous, what stresste the Queen, who therefore could not shine on stage. &quot;
And you could see in her first performance in swimsuit at the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although they both appeared safe, but she lacked the strength and momentum that featured representatives from the Magdalena and Atlántico on display.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the &quot;Como en Casa&quot; for channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, &quot;shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, but not finally becomes queen.&quot;
In addition, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that the Jury regarding Valle convince her interest in social work could not understand what is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest.
It&#39;ll have a reason, said that two days prior to the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who dedicated herself to the social affairs of their country.
&quot;Beauty alone for Miss Colombia is not enough. One must also look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that they had worked before entering the competition on projects,&quot; she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with their defects in the derriere and fibrosis, which is noted in her stomach. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose as a candidate for &#39;natural beauty&#39; with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body that there are better there, &quot;but their problem was with the fibrosis of the abdomen, for me to be honest hardly noticeable, their scores expressed on the last Day. &quot;
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the journal Cromos of view, the problem of women from Valle del Cauca, the surgical intervention, which they had subjected themselves were.
&quot;The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how they should let them do it right.
Her body has never been her strong suit, and that body had to pay them. &quot;
Because of this award, the first awarded by the National Beauty Contest, created after the show in a bathing suit is a cruel prediction that should be true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had been a consolation prize, so as not to have come to enjoy the crown.
Whether that&#39;s true or not, the fact is that Melina today takes up her reign year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers them the opportunity to appoint the National Pageant Colombia in an international competition to represent .
However, they will go down as one of the queens, who had escaped, despite their overwhelming presence of the crown in Cartagena, in the story.
