Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers working in such good shape?
About 19% of disabled people are to find a job.
Today begins the &quot;15th week of work for the disabled&quot;.
Despite a purposeful public policy that was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% versus 9% of the total population Arbeitlosigkeit.
Discouraging?
&quot;No, it says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the&quot; Week of work for the disabled &quot;align.&quot;
&quot;The results achieved within fifteen years, progress has been substantial.&quot;
&quot;At that time the unemployment rate is not twice but three times as high.&quot;
&quot;Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount to do.&quot;
It must be said, however, that for the unemployed with disabilities continue to survive numerous obstacles before they get a job.
More often it hits the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low skill level: 80% of them have no school and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities under the 2.3 million students in higher education.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that are difficult to re-start work, and &quot;form the core of the problem&quot; that the said Christian grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an organization formed in 1992, the company is assisting to recruit disabled workers.
So much material on the brakes.

Result that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987 is to achieve.
The latter, referred from 2008 numbers originating at a ratio of 2.6%.
&quot;We are now at around 3%,&quot; says Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization that is mandated to collect contributions from companies who violate this law.
Proof: The number &quot;fees paid&quot; permanent establishment has been reduced as the sum of the amounts paid in 2007-2011, namely zahlenmäβig of 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
&quot;The 2005 law provides that premium increases, creating a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc.&quot;
&quot;But it also brings a real improvement in knowledge particularly in the groβen business groups expressed.&quot;
According to the Ministry of Labour employ only 59% of premises 20-49 employees, disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees and 82% contrast.
