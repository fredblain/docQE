Voracek and Jagr helped Philadelphia with her assistant to victory
The ice hockey forward Jaromir Jagr had the Monday game in the NHL with two assistants large share of the 5-3 victory at Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina, and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
Beneficiaries of the survey of thirty-nine Hockey Stars in both cases was Claude Giroux, who have added an assistant and was proclaimed the best player of the match.
Two assistants also recorded in the same game Jagr&#39;s teammate Jakub Voracek.
Jagr claimed to journalists after the match, he predicts a great evening Giroux.
&quot;Even before the game I told him that he now manages a hat-trick.&quot;
I somehow had the feeling. &quot;
&quot;Every now and then one comes upon such a feeling,&quot; said Jagr, scored according to its action at the first shot Giroux of the Flyers a goal.
A bit later, also had the second hit, &quot;a Czech track.&quot;
Voracek fought behind the gate of the Hurricanes the puck and put it before the successful between the circles Maxim Talbot.
One second before the final whistle of the first third of the home players scored Patrick Dwyer, a short-hander, but the second was one-third again the Flyers.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jagr he scored his third goal, after his shot deflected Wayne Simmonds to the fourth gate.
&quot;I love to play with him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that he is the best player in the league, but he certainly is one of the top three,&quot; Jagr acknowledged its center.
&quot;I would not have occurred in the life that I play to end my career with such a hockey player together, as with him.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;m absolutely delighted.&quot;
&quot;I cut my game to me.&quot;
&quot;All these years in the NHL put my players their game on me and now the tables turn around,&quot; Jagr smiled.
Carolina did not match the drama - the hit of Tuoma Ruutua again and Dwyer, who prevailed in a penalty shot, it came up on a goal.
Matt Read prevented any further complication, however, in which he was successful in over number two against one.
&quot;Excellent Pronger still acted in our zone.&quot;
&quot;He caught the puck, I picked up speed, and (Read) moved to distant posts.&quot;
&quot;I tried to make and I am glad that it worked,&quot; described Voracek the last goal of the game from his perspective.
With this victory, Philadelphia took the lead the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal, Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the game against Buffalo, and retired in the second trimester because of an injury of the upper body.
The Candiens lost their next pool their experience and leadership in a penalty shoot-not lost 2:3.
Could not convert any of the penalty shots Tomas Plekanec.
More than the lost points were hurting the coach of the home team probably the high sickness absence on the defensive - the game they played with only five defenders to the end.
&quot;This is bad.&quot;
&quot;The meeting we played with only one experienced player at the end, the rest were young players.&quot;
&quot;But there can do nothing, so we must be ready,&quot; said Jacques Martin.
&quot;Every time you change an attacking wave after another and we had nothing to oppose.&quot;
&quot;We could make the game easier and bring the puck out of our third need.&quot;
There were some reserves, &quot;said PK Subban, a defensive player.
