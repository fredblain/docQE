EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and Euro-skeptics
&quot;The Treaty of Lisbon the balance among the different institutions has brought tangible out of kilter.&quot;
I would not expect such a tough war breaks out. &quot;
&quot;It will take five or six years, until things have calmed down and all of their new role will have become accustomed,&quot; Milena began Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its pretty sharp lecture at the Law Faculty.
How serious it&#39;s motto &quot;of course, open to Europe &#39;takes, they showed in the first part of her presentation in which she succeeded in the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they many a lecturer at the Law Faculty of Charles University would envy you.
Mrs. Vicenová while also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
&quot;At first, been criticized, he was too discreet - a gray civil servant who is not such a role has grown, but I must say, it has all the cunning breathing, as well as he has taken up the cause.
&quot;He is a man who contrives to listen to twenty-seven Member States patient to communicate with them and has the particularly clear idea of ​​how it should proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then she explained in answer to the question: What is God - the European Union? What number should I call? &quot;That is an important step towards unification and readability of the EU&#39;s policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs. Vicenová also devoted himself to the agenda, according to the European Union, lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago she described as a success.
The Czechs had weathered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosts the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the presidency called them big negative factor, the image of the Czech Republic have greatly harmed.
The Czech representative in the EU has to do with full hands.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not just the presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has yet to overcome to this day, quite too hectic.
And there has yet to seven-year EU budget be approved, which makes the whole thing just because of today&#39;s economic situation more complicated.
Whether it&#39;s a budget is lean and economical, which sectors get priority in which countries and which are promoted less more - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also reminded of their own slogans, with whom she came to Brussels: &quot;Europe course&quot;.
&quot;If I do not like something, then there are grayish abbreviation, foreign words and technical jargon that nobody understands.
How should I as a citizen really know whether you conceives in Brussels really crooked or curved cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether we actually want to ban someone the cake of cheese.
It would have the bottom of the EU also used to like to get more Czechs in European Institutions.
Europe of two different speeds or in prospect
In the EU&#39;s ambassador to the Czechs have a reputation of being Euro-skeptics, the more negative, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter.
More annoying is the poor representation of Czechs in European Institutions.
Because many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write Motivierungsbriefe and last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, they also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
&quot;Believe me, when a Pole or a Hungarian and a Slovak comes to me is near, then the Frenchman next to me says,&quot; Hey, what you put there heads together - this is again your V4 &quot;and it makes? a rather sour face.
According to Mrs. Vicenové the EU expected in the future especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As a lot of real, as a &quot;European Federation&quot; she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even at different speeds.
&quot;We have the euro-zone countries and countries outside the euro zone.
&quot;We the Schengen area and we have already strengthened the institution of cooperation have.&quot;
&quot;For the first time was told that only the countries should work together, who want and those who do not want to quietly stand aside.&quot;
&quot;There will be more and more of such institutions, which in the end to a strong&quot; multi-speed Europe &quot;boils&quot;, expected Vicenová woman.
In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle according to which all issues must be discussed with implications on the entire EU by all Member States, not only from the countries of the euro zone.
