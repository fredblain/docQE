Boeing takes record order of 18 trillion dollars worth of land
Emirates airline ordered 50 two-course Boeing 777 with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, six Boeing Dreamliner, Boeing sold to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $ 1 trillion.
It is truly a rare news that a company gets an order for 50 units of its products.
But it&#39;s a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft as a whole is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines needed from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2520 airplanes worth 450 trillion dollars.
Boeing announced at the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, based on the value of the order: 50, two popular Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the Dubai based Emirates Airline.
The airline has also, so Boeing announced it in 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which can increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to then ordered six Boeing 787-8 Boeing Oman Air, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves fuel economy and comfort of passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
&quot;This is absolutely positive for Boeing,&quot; said Neal Dihora, stock market expert to Morningstar.
&quot;The quality of this particular customer is very high.&quot;
Many airlines in the Middle East are in the possession of the oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which harms the airlines in general, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not as damaging as the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because they tend less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
&quot;They have a natural hedge,&quot; he said.
The appointment of Emirates Boeing confirms leadership position in the market for large aircraft and helps keep the rival Airbus SAS in check, attacking the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing&#39;s victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay deployment of the main A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
They postponed the launch to gain more confidence after the customer had a higher payload and range required.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $ 67.94.
