&quot;Cold and inhuman,&quot; Anders Breivik Behring first appears before a public court
Anders Breivik Behring, the man who has been two shootings in which this summer in Norway has 77 people were killed himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a &quot;resistance&quot; fighters described.
&quot;I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar in Norway,&quot; he told a courtroom with more than 500 people.
&quot;I raise an objection to the court, since you received your mandate of organizations that support the ideologies of hatred, multiculturalism and because it is supported.&quot;
&quot;I acknowledge the laws but I do not plead guilty.&quot;
Judge Torkjel Nesheim Breivik interrupted during this monologue because he &quot;did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can bring his views to express.&quot;
For the same reason he refused Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, leave, turn to the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police reserves Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody, he spent four weeks without access to the media. He said that the authorities of all visits and all correspondence will control just over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to be able to see into the eyes Breivik, others wanted to confirm that it remains under lock and key.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything boils down to an incarceration.
&quot;I thought, he seems cold and inhuman,&quot; said a survivor of Utoya the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
&quot;It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a step further, since I have seen the suspect and heard.&quot;
Breivik was wearing a dark suit and a blue tie and worked throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eyes when he entered the building and then left.
Despite Breiviks bizarre note, he would be part of a larger &quot;resistance&quot; movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may suit some, that the attacks of 22 July seems to be the work of an individual and not the extremists was a radical group.
But makes it easy to automatically grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
&quot;I wish he looked like a monster, but he does not,&quot; said the relatives of a victim.
&quot;It would be so much easier if he did.&quot;
