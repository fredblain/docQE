Debt for construction work
The measures provided for in the programs Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos 3x1 and social housing for migrants run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds, or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Head of the Municipal Social Development stated that although the construction programs are already well advanced, they float in danger now, as has the State Government to its rightful funds that exceed the three programs 11 million pesos is not paid.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounts to almost 50 million pesos, which fell 25 percent to the state. Until now, only the Federation and the community have contributed to the construction funds, so a delay in the completion of the building was to be expected.
&quot;12 million they need to contribute, and although the year is already over, they have given us a penny, even though they are already in July would have to pay a portion,&quot; he said. &quot;In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money.&quot;
He pointed out that, under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state does not fulfill its obligations, so the community had to take to start his reign of a loan of EUR 7 million. This would correspond to the amount that would have to raise the central government.
&quot;Ran That was us gone in the last legislative period so because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continue and this year we had the means procure, who had not applied the state to participate in these programs&quot; , he said.
While government authorities are obliged to pay these funds, he commented that the Minister for Finance and Administration, has been requested to expedite the administrative work and the outstanding equity to pay off as quickly as possible.
&quot;They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already over, they have given us a penny.&quot;
