The bank scandal of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not sitting in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS was nearly bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to another.
Now it is directed by a German.
So it was not thought safe, Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank had become known in July that he would take up nearly as 2013, a spectacular new job: Chairman of the Swiss banking giant UBS - An unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was looking forward publicly praised her beauty to Switzerland and UBS whether their new-found solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
&quot;UBS has managed the turnaround.&quot;
&quot;I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger, Oswald Grübel.&quot;
But in September it became clear that everything would turn out quite differently.
A trader at UBS in London, had bypassed all the security systems of the bank and gambled around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS chief executive Oswald Grübel, a place famous not only bankers in Switzerland, had to go.
The chairman of UBS has since become a well struck - and everyone asks: When will come Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber must advise the Bank from February 2012.
And the Chairman of the Board, he is already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
Axel Weber is hard.
He is not a banker, but economics professor and central bankers, and had a training period had certainly needed.
At a stroke he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that she has already earned the title of &quot;biggest bank scandal of Europe.&quot;
Because UBS is a huge part - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and slides on the other hand for years of a scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, remains of the once-proud Swiss bank saves.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the silent and sound, but also savvy Swiss wealth manager they had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in investment banking is a very large number.
Sun managed by UBS in 2007 on the one hand with $ 1.6 trillion more money for wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it was advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
That makes an impression.
The former banker and later years of banking in Zurich Professor Hans Geiger says: &quot;I have my students at that time, UBS still held up as model of a good bank.&quot;
&quot;In retrospect, one wonders: How could I be wrong just like that?&quot;
He was wrong.
In 2007, apparently for the first time that something went wrong in belonging to UBS.
Middle of the year was chief executive Peter Wuffli back surprisingly, regarded until then as well as a highly intellectual and brilliant bankers.
A few months later they guessed why he was gone.
The Investment Division of the Bank had gambled with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To the shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs.
But they did find investors, but what about the many to have turned up shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secret that not even heard his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The new bank had to announce billions in losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 or the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 came the catastrophe be the UBS was considering its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the government.
The National Bank purchased from UBS for billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion francs for a mandatory convertible, which they could be co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she realized how dramatic it is for a small country, if it home to such large banks.
Finally, the total assets of UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
&quot;Once again we could not save the UBS,&quot; says Bank researchers violinist.
At the first disaster was followed to the second.
A few months later capitulated in the UBS tax dispute with the United States and agreed to publish the data of wealthy clients, who had probably evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - in repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including criminal charge.
Thus, UBS, more or less openly confessed to have helped with tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that had always been their capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was not the same Swiss banking secrecy.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and chairman.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, the bank had lost its credibility within a few months in both the central business areas: investment banking through the incorrect speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion.
And just when it was a bit quiet again, just when you thought, now that UBS would have done it again, there follows this unfortunate story Dealer: An individual trader gambled 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it is evident: The risk management in investment banking, you&#39;re still not clear.
&quot;The case has Adoboli you have to realize that the risk control has changed little,&quot; said Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich bank.
Also, the CFO of a major German bank is confident: &quot;The problem with that UBS&#39;s risk control is not under control.&quot;
It was exactly the idea of ​​caution was that the Swiss bankers were begun long ago, keeper of the great fortunes of the world are to: not too much risk, but security for the money - might also be beyond the Alpine republic once to collapse the world .
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for very fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich, still fits the stereotype of the dignified Swiss private bank - it&#39;s just a bit larger.
The location alone is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich Bahnhofstrasse, which leads directly to the main station of Zurich, which is framed by the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany&#39;s can be found here between the traditional Swiss shops like Sprüngli.
Reside here for centuries, the Swiss banks: National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are marble-clad walls, standing in front of thick leather chair, next to the bank logo a large sign for &quot;safe&quot;.
UBS knows what the client looks here: security.
This idea of ​​the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank is.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two commercial banks.
UBS has become too large, it is - especially in investment banking, which had also spread the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss would have to say there&#39;s nothing more.
&quot;And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS changed, gave her first big profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost in the subprime jungle as much money as the Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the visible disaster.
&quot;That Wednesday, the government decided Coalition of the small country&#39;s seven million, the biggest bailout in the history of their nation,&quot; the author writes Luke Hässig in his book &quot;The UBS-Crash&quot;.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros granted to politicians in order to save the bank from bankruptcy standing.
How could this happen?
When speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, included two of the three major Swiss banks together into a huge corporation.
There was a bank that was already in the merger too big for the little Switzerland - and ever growing.
It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS completed: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers were favorable to a lot of money with which they could turn a giant wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS&#39;s Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 CEO of UBS, Marcel Ospel, and, then Chairman of the Board.
&quot;I always thought Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team,&quot; says Bank researchers Hans Geiger.
&quot;Wuffli, the high intellectuals, Modest, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man, who has worked up by the bank clerk to the top.&quot;
But Ospel had to leave at the end of Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake: &quot;He thought that his models were the reality,&quot; says Geiger.
&quot;This is a tragic case.&quot;
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear that arrogance came before a fall.
Employees of UBS remember much of the leadership meetings where CEO Wuffli spent repeating the same slogan: Goldman Sachs, on this day.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the &quot;league tables&quot; that rank lists, the success of the banks at that time documented.
Then did the UBS to the top.
Some steps had already succeeded her.
In the foreign exchange and equity trading business, she appeared at the top.
Consultants who were commissioned lifted, however, shows a weakness in the international business interest in the language of bankers &quot;fixed income&quot;, there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that nearly cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth investing, both the bank acts as a hedge fund founded in front of her in American sub-prime assets.
It developed into a powerful machine, the securities of American mortgages packaged and passed it - but it also kept itself risks.
Even more than other banks long since sought the exit.
&quot;In the summer of 2007 when the U.S. housing market was on fire, UBS has bought there,&quot; said banking expert violinist.
As great as the euphoria, so deep is the case.
A manager had to go after the other, as the clean up efforts ausfielen difficult than expected.
Positions at UBS were the ejection seat and are still shaky.
Who Leads the bank has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank of any adjacent business models have been lost.
Bank researchers Geiger has already an idea: Stop the investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the roots in Switzerland.
Quite as much the bank will not (yet) do not.
But investment banking is expected to shrink strongly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday will the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was meant only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprisingly Grübel from previous split.
Meanwhile, he has prevailed: he will always lead the operations of UBS, said the Zurich-based bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti will return the investment bank to the state in the mid nineties.
3,500 jobs, he emphasizes.
It is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What they want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is now safe.
Publicly, he says so far only, he would find his wife only once a flat in Zurich.
Next year.
