The world according to Council Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry regarding compete in oversimplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and support for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America is a complex world with simple, not to say, do silly ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates so voters could almost get that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and her colleagues whose thundering declarations and their statements can be about the Foreign Policy, a traditional Republican emphasis, repeatedly announce.
Fall on China, Iran and the Israel-help - often in no way substantiated - slogans.
The threat regarding the appointment of the &quot;Grand Old Party&quot; highest in class standing Mitt Romney, the Chinese people to quote from the WTO and the &quot;currency manipulation&quot; - a leading topic in an America that is irritated by the migration of entire industrial sectors to Asia again Äuβerste to accuse -.
Bad luck, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to be a mature vision of Foreign Policy have to have nearly cut off in terms of his emotions flattering conduct the air.
He had called for a full-blown, but constructive exchange of ideas with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not heard, since he stagnated in the depths of public opinion polls.
Reagan&#39;s likeness
Romney had also vowed military strikes against Iran if sanctions should fail to Stoppung the nuclear program.
&quot;If I am elected, I command stop Iran,&quot; he had smoked.
&quot;Will Obama re-elected, they get the bomb.&quot;
In addition, he has promised increased military aid to Israel and Obama accused of being partners with respect to obligations that remained guilty.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain&#39;s second highest, placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful acts of ignorance on display.
Recently he called for giving the Chinese military threat against, since Beijing, &quot;trying to develop a nuclear power&quot; - and seemed to be the fact auβer eight that China is already in possession of military Atomarwaffen since 1964!
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran äuβert, in turn, to be willing to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
Obama 2009, said the use of Foltermaβnahmen against terrorists mutmaβlichen was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents counter, Reagan had also had a simple idea and won in spite of all the Cold War.
They recall that Obama was selbstein amateur and water had to give in his wine, for that matter about anti-terrorism.
They insist on right to the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his &quot;boys&quot; from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility is not quite so easy.
The population estimates rather positive assessment of the National Security under Obama, I have turned off the store.
Since Iraq, she is wary of military intervention, leading to paralysis.
And Obama surprised reasonable, arguing that America needed to be rebuilt economically, to bring his leadership to a new life.
