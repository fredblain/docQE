MSS announces a research protocol to locate the gene for obesity
She leads a Mexican Social Security Institute research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Institute) announced that it directs a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title &quot;Genetics of obesity in childhood and youth,&quot; with which the genetic markers associated found to be overweight.
Miguel Cruz Lopez, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica s Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, specializing in Biochemistry) at the Hospital Clinic de Especialidades del Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers set up was.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Advanced Studies (CINVESTAV) del Instituto Nacional Politécnico (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday will be conducted from 8:00 clock tests with children and adolescents.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtemoc (west of the State of Mexico) and since 8 Will continue in October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (east of the State of Mexico).
If the goal is reached 500-600 study subjects, the study is on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and continued on the Morelos (in the north of the capital district) completed.
He explained that the purpose of this study was to learn about the factors and the role of genetics in conjunction with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
To mark the world day of diabetes, he said it would strive to represent three thousand children and teenagers between the ages of six and should complete 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents&#39; nutritional questionnaires.
You are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history to risk factors, diabetes or renal failure could result in control.
He stated further, measured to the mentioned Saturday, the study subjects (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure checks and blood tests such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood ) were determined.
Cruz Lopez emphasized that this investigation would be carried out at the concerns of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight of young people.
&quot;Resulted in the health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that was in almost six years has increased the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 per cent of the girls with obesity by 47 percent. The obesity had increased dramatically,&quot; said the specialist, the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified, because the genetic history of the Mexican population differences from that of other nations.
He stated that a (n) Mexicans (in) was on average 65 percent of Indian-American, 30 percent European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity in the context .
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity push in the inability to burn the excess of taken us energy (calories) from, so this will be stored as fat.
The researchers explained that the direct benefits for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, would be found in whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigated the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inside arms (acanthosis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage.
All information was kept confidential and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to parents all the measurement results and beat them in front of lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz Lopez said that there were three basic factors that are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases, sedentary lifestyle, which means lack of movement in everyday life that most of the day to spend watching television and use of transport, rather than short distances to feet to go.
The high caloric intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics that will be analyzed in this research project.
