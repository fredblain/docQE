Managers of the union will file a lawsuit against the city because of layoffs
Have the union, the hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, represents plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as layoffs teach because of their disproportionate influence in the schools, poor students, and do not necessarily discriminatory.
The action is probably the last opportunity for the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make the layoffs reversed is still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the lowest paid employee of the city and on the 7th October had lost in a move by their work, the union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city access to a health fund, which amused the workgroup, had denied to the budgetary gap should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools in the last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that we have adopted in June.
A member of the City Council fired back, telling him that nothing in the Budget Just specify that employees of the school aid would be released.
Officials of the City Council 37 said they had warned the Ministry of Education and before an action. On Wednesday there will be a press conference at which the filing of the suit in the Supreme Court will be announced formally in Manhattan.
The suit will perform Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City as a defendant and eight laid-off workers are counted as plaintiff, all of which are colored or Hispanic women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department of the city, said the city would not be before the lawsuit and therefore could not be commented on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit design, the New York Times exists, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the slums of the city to support a claim for discrimination. She claims that poor schools have lost more workers since they are chronically underfunded.
She argues that while there were no layoffs on Staten Iceland and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side and TriBeCa, have lost 17 school volunteers in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 volunteers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were dismissed.
By noting the loss of five out of eight school volunteers who in the public schools and 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were hired, says the lawsuit: &quot;This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents, the donations can organize to absorb budget cuts. &quot;
P.S.: The budget of the 36th District has been reduced this year by 3.26 percent. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for the extra funding for each charity school enrollment.
The union complains also that the head of the high schools by the language in the memo have been misled, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word &quot;excess&quot; to describe the action, even if the &quot;excess&quot; (German: on set) in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers from the Central Office be paid.
&quot;Sixty-six care coordinators were fired, not transferred,&quot; says the suit design.
