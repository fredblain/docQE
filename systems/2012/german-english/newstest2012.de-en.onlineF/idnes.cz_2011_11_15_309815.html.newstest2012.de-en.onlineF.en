Professionals state - a Stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the introductory article over it, as Stylisten learn, I had a little grumbled that was a little too much material for the beginning.
There I did not suspect in the slightest, what still comes.
Lectures of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how runs “at the place”.
It is to come still more badly.
The more near the examination moves, all the more information and practical tasks is approaching for us.
In addition, if the course of each Saturday takes place and Sundays, it is nevertheless fully occupied.
This time we debated with directress Alena (at the course not one man takes part), as one attracts a woman, who does not have an ideally proportionierte figure.
And those are nevertheless most of us.
A too short neck, the others have the one a too youngful figure without tidy curves and again different are chubby.
It is thing of the Stylisten to cover broad shoulders optically to extend the neck or the necessary curves conjure up.
We got also hints, as one tightens a type of woman such as Jennifer Lopez - thus with large bosom, broad hip and narrow waist - prettily and figure-stressed, without she works all too provocatively.
If for example the difference between waist and hips is so large that the skirt or the pants does not fit really, one should leave oneself at least one piece to made to measure cutters.
One will not repent that surely, because well sitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a custom-made skirt feels one much better, than in one of the bar, which high all the time and slips, in the waist is away, etc.
Boy-clung figures can take the liberty again, clothing with folds, billowing, applications, to carry embroideries or Raffung.
With this quantity of information and figure types I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me everything go thoroughly through the head.
And nevertheless I have fear that it is not to be created in view of the laid on homework nearly.
Everyone of the class participants got a celeb assigned, for which it was to invent fitting outfit - daily clothing and evening robe.
Are we the present appearance, which mode style of the appropriate star and its type of figure consider.
I am Miranda Kerr “to tighten”, you possibly from the campaign Victoria's Secret know.
On the inside I am jubilant, because that is personally much better for me, than attracting for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who lately probably to the hundred Kilos increased (well well, which are a little exaggerated), or also young Selena Gomez.
The articles of clothing we are of magazines to cut out or in the Internet look for, expressions and afterwards graphically work on.
In the “Moodboard”, how the whole result is called, our completely personal style and our relationship with the graphic organization are to then come to the expression.
It is very important to think also about the graphic side of the styling.
The Stylist attracts the models not only purely physically, but arranged also the so-called product side in the journals (after concrete default, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Of it the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But only on Sunday.
That is, that a Stylist must have good highlights.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was equivalent peppered of three visitors from the industry:
of the Stylisten January Pokorný, of the mode creator Jakub Polanka and by the mode photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us of the fact that mode is illusion and some Stylist should be capable of using this.
And returned Stylist is able to work with only one piece of clothing in completely different way.
The magic word is called variability.
So one can carry for example a trench coat as used to over the jeans, thus like a T-shirt or a coat, one can him in addition, on the naked body carry, paragraph shoes in addition put on and him as dress carry.
It is enough to turn up the sleeves or the collars and directly looks the whole look completely differently.
“Thereby”, stressed he plays.
At most me however the following advice came convenient: “Must first you the rules perfectly know.”
“May only then you it injure”, said Jakub.
Finally it becomes clear me why we all these theorems to swot to have, which one can combine with which and why, even if one gets to see frequently completely different one in fashion journals.
To be silent from fashion shows completely.
Owing to the photographer Ben I know now that a Stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants, than he photographs finally.
Thus one must be preparatory for a Fashion story with ten sides (speak ten of outfit) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with further accessories looks every now and then completely differently, as in reality.
On all that one must count thus with the organization of the outfit.
That image and style every now and then half of success constitute, confirmed us also January Pokorný.
There one needs only times Madonna to have regarded have made from the images and marketing a world star a not straight brilliant singer.
In Czech Republic one stands for the services of a Stylisten rather reserved opposite.
Also well-known personalities regard this frequently as eliminated money (the main thing is that I bring something, as I thereby look is secondary).
And if someone from us can to be styled, then we are to count on the fact that it or it forces upon us in all probability completely different (smaller) size, than he or she needs in reality.
Then one needs to only google afterwards, in order to determine with security that the popular press writes, the appropriate celeb or decreased, etc.
January and Mario put us on Sunday to the heart not to believe that a Stylist needs only on the fashion to focus and then the outfit “assemble”.
With its work it must communicate particularly with humans, who he styles and it must be a cunning psychologist.
Humans estimate to curry favor without itself and to his opinion stand.
“If us any manager orders, in order to sight and supplement around pretty pieces its wardrobe, then we cannot eliminate and say the whole cabinet for her - my God, that is terrible.”
“One must at least to few lobenswerte things find, to which one recommends, what one in addition carry can”, says Mario.
It showed us also completely concretely, what must contain so so-called “blow-out ashes”.
Thus so a bag, which one buttons up at the waist and carries in which one all necessary Proprietäten with itself.
Except such clear things, like shears, unwind stand to the hair removing or safety pins contains it also such implements, like a nylon thread (with it the Stylist helps itself when photographing products, like handbags or hats out), special clips, with which in the back the clothes are dug, if it is too large (pins or other clamps are forbidden, thus the material not broken go) and naturally sewing kit.
So that we do not however only have to listen, but also somewhat practically to try out to be able, we learned, how one under-sticks shoes correctly.
Also when photographing in the studio, where the floor is even, one can damage the sole, not to speak of that outside.
O stuck us and stuck we…
With the shears one may not even affect the shoes, so that one does not damage her.
Thus one must proceed really skillfully.
Mario pleased me, by praising my “creation” without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is not straight my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we got to hear with at the second week END continuation course.
One became clear me in the meantime - the styling on professional level to dedicate, no children's game is.
