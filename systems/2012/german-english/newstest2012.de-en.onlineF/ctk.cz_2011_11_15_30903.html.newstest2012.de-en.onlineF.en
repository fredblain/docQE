The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Already nearly five months long the Czech football does not have a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the point of the Czech football federation (FAČR) does not even admit after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be.
Until today there is still no agreement over it, after which electoral law is to be selected.
And without these at all no vote is possible over the three potential successors.
Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek withdrew from its function, whereby he requested his colleagues with resignation had to agree and to find a strong personality, that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old arguments between the two federation chambers broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This showed up klipp and clearly on 16 September, when the new chairman should be selected.
The delegated ones of the general meeting had come completely in vain into the community center in the Prague quarter of Smíchov, because the negotiation it led not only of the choice to no result and was a matter.
One could not agree times on who during the full collection actually enfranchised actual only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with an authority.
In this only point one obtained at least partial agreement, to which also the recommendation of the institute for state and right contributed, according to whose opinion an agency on authority basis was not permitted.
The disputes around the electoral law persist however further.
Also the executive committee did not bring any more clarity into the thing, with whose meetings - no matter whether tidy or extraordinary - nothing at all in principle different more on the agenda stands.
Even if the views regarding the choice a few marks changed - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question reads: how is one to proceed in the 3rd round, in order to avoid a deadlock?
“The point at issue concerns the question whether one is to proceed in agreement with the statute, or whether completely different model must be found”, determined to Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairmen of the FAČR, which represents the professional football in the management.
According to statutory model that candidate, who receives the larger percentage support in the chamber, triumphs for which it stood as a candidate in the third round.
Moravia is allegedly ready to deal with the compromise that candidate triumphs, who receives the higher number of voices from both chambers.
The Czech side again insists on the condition that the winner receives a two-thirds majority during this percentage voting counting at least.
“Then the two first rounds have at all no more sense, this mode the entire bicameral concept in question would place” to select understand Svoboda the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best, not to sort out the electoral law but according to valid statute.
That agrees surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík, even if it appears that the statutory electoral law of all candidates at the earliest probably Pelta comes against.
“My desire is it that after the statute one selects as far as possible.”
“With it no unreasonable spare variants to be invented, as at the last general meeting”, the owner (the soccer club) explained to Victoria Plzeň, which stands as a candidate for the first time and defined themselves in its statements above all opposite Pelta.
Pelta remains however optimistic.
According to its opinion will in Nymburk the new chairman admits to be and it believes that the candidates in the future will also constructionally co-operate.
“The possible qualification of the national team for the football European championships on the today's day would contribute surely to calming of the mind.”
“If the football only on the euphoric wave rides, then also the readiness for co-operation is larger”, means the functionary from Jablonec, that from all three Adepten the largest experiences bring along and this both on professional, and regional level.
Rajchl is there more reserved.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalently.”
“That is not a thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts “to bend into shape” the regulations for own purposes.”
“Therefore a renewed blocking is not impossible at the general meeting.”
“I hope however that the common sense triumphs finally”, said to Rajchl.
Only - much time for the agreement of all sides does not remain any more.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals up to the qualification play will be at all complete.
The charter aircraft, with which among other things Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance at all and looked for one feverish in such a way for a spare variant to be brought as one a part of the executive committee still to the venue of the bar rising up first leg.
Finally then nevertheless probably the meeting on Minister level is crucial, to which it is to come allegedly on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, which would have Ministers for public education, youth and body education the split parties within the largest sport federation of the country gladly induced to an agreement.
It stands much on the play: national allowances, Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and also the lining up general meeting of the ČSTV, which is to point toward the financial problems from Sazka the new direction to the Czech sport.
Paclík goes into the fight for the position of the chairman, because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the boss of the Pilsner soccer players before the extraordinary general meeting had been able to constitute a strong candidate, who would have fulfilled all to its conceptions over the new chairmen of the football federation of the Czech Republic of (FAČR), he would not have gotten involved at all in the fight for this top position.
“If it a good candidate would give, then I would fight for it and without the choice would do.”
“However in the present situation it did not succeed to find such Adepten”, said Paclík ČTK.
The principal reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to be prevented it thus that the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta, at which point of the FAČR arrives.
Paclík stresses also that he intends to exercise the function of the chairman only one year in case of his victory, thus until 2013, up to the date of the statutory general meeting.
In the position of the chairman he would have seen gladly experienced Top manager, who is involved into the football happening not too much to one.
“With some which are applicable people I spoke personally.”
“To hardly believe that some said to me, they did not want to identify themselves at present with the Czech football.
“Gladly” he would have changed, stated such opinions.
At most of everything Paclík disturbs allegedly the connection Pelta's with the chairman of the Pilsner of district football federation novel Berbr to affect a man with controversial call, which is considered behind the scenes as powerful lobbyist, with the ability, delegation votes on general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta would have the position of the chairman.
“With its victory the today's condition and in the Czech football was in-conserved would not precede it.”
“The support by Berbr, smarter Businessman, would doubly badly get the football”, stressed Paclík.
Hereby it alludes also to it that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone hearing to the determination in a corruption affair, from which Pelta however exempt from punishment came out.
“I do not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta (tsch.) Football to bring in should.”
“And as we would stand there, said in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA” řekl Paclík, to which its earlier utterance, “it will sell the Pilsner soccer club, if Pelta of chairmen becomes”, but already somewhat more left sees.
If Paclík in the Thursday choice should triumph, he can quite imagine however a future co-operation with Pelta.
Exactly the same also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl, which Paclík before the general meeting had supported in the October, which ended with a fiasco.
“It (Pelta) would be first, to which I would go.”
“It has large abilities”.
“I could understand myself it well for example as a boss of the national team.”
“However I do not believe to lead that he is capable, the federation as managers.”
“I am not my nose nevertheless into affairs, about which I understand, said nothing” Paclík, which had provided in September thereby for attention that he stood behind the recall of the arbitrator commission with Luďěk Macela at the point, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík stated, it feels the role of the federation chairman grown.
And thereby he refers also a boss of Pilsen to its abilities with the line of private businesses, since past summer is, which celebrated first Triumph in the league with its support in May.
“I have the power to change and contribute to a certain cultivation of this something in the football environment.”
To limit “around the influence of certain groups of interests, which tend to affect disciplinary and appointment commissions which degenerates, stated in repugnant situations” Paclík, which does not make no secret from its antipathy for example opposite the Sparta boss of Daniel Křetínský.
When it would regard one of its priorities the consolidation of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech olympia committee, with whose assistance he would lobbyieren with the political point politicians for it that more funds from the lottery tax into the sport flows.
“That is one of the crucial things, to which the new chairman should dedicate himself”.
“If it for the taxation of luck plays comes, how the political parties define, then understands I its argumentation, then they must say in addition, klipp and clearly, where the money goes, said” it.
Its connection to the Pilsner club does not regard Paclík likewise as handicap, although it stresses, the chairman of the FAČR must be “non-partisan”.
Pelta again is connected to Rajchl with the Prague Dukla with Jablonec.
“That is not ideal straight.”
“It makes for my opinion in addition, not much sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritically to a third person over after one and a half years again to return”, got straight Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would exclude a deadlock in the future.
One of the candidates for the office for chairman, i.e. Miroslav Pelta, promised two days before the general meeting of the football federation it in case of his choice for the fact will make itself strong that the FAČR gets new statute, which excludes in the future disputes over the electoral law from the beginning.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign with a possible success of the Czech selection will defuse themselves surely.
Pelta had already promised before the not realized choice in September, he wanted to concentrate in case of his choice on the national team and the production of moneys.
He decided only on the last moment to take part in the choice before the last general meeting and so might him the two-month break have helped have defended and have presented in a broader context its conceptions over the line of the football.
“People on all levels dedicate themselves, it to the football are impatient and expect from there that the chairman admits on Thursday is.”
“It feels that it is high time that the federation is led by someone, means the man, who is connected particularly with the Jablonecer club in addition, many years with Sparta and in the executive committee acted.
Also therefore he that he sufficient experiences have means, in order to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that for the today's problems with the choice the euphoria is responsible, which prevailed at times of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately at the general meeting in June statutes were approved of, which were not so perfect, as all had accepted it.
If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had, meant a chairman starting from September already” Pelta.
It used the straight revision of the most important document of the citizen combination as LOCK means for the delegated ones.
“I should become chairman, then I take care of its personally and am ready personally responsibility to be carried, if it does not fold.”
“That is a thing in principle, without which he can not be”, states Pelta.
In the further one it does not try to define itself opposite its contractors.
Already in former times he had announced, he could imagine a co-operation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of its legal education and he knows well that its rival candidate would be its first deputy.
Also Tomáš Paclík it attacked not for a long time, which let again no dry thread at Pelta.
In the football it already moves over one year and can already refer to certain successes.”
“Its attacks were disparaging however and many people were shocked from its election campaign.”
“Also therefore now many doubt addressed Pelta its contractor, who remains faithful probably for its proclaiming its real character”, which it already in September expressed.
According to its opinion its strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football of lowest divisions, up to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech football.
“I would strive also to terminate all affairs - of the Causa Bohemians, up to resounding the corruption scandal from the past year.”
“Soon after I would fall myself on negotiations with the private and national sector, around sufficient moneys for the whole football to guarantee”, said the six-and fourty-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he promised also that its introduction will not mean personnel cleanings into the point of the Czech football.
“I would have to familiarize myself for a start with work contents of all persons employed”, said he toward Strahov, where due to the long anarchy as may be understood nervousness prevails.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the lining up general meeting, he believes that the delegated ones do not drive in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
“The only contentious point to be if real should, how one selects in the third round, then gets we over it.”
“The football needs reliability and recovers it only thereby if it finally a new Leader has”, remains Pelta two days the possibly crucial day ago of its functionary career optimistically.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR under him begins to work hard
If the past deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl on the general meeting should be selected on Thursday to the new chairman of the football federation of the Czech republic, this allegedly many people in the federation the mood would spoil.
Rajchl promises that one begins to work in case of its choice hard.
It wants changes of system would bring in and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football ranges to make.
In addition it promised to solve the case Bohemians to improve the relations with the UEFA and FIFA to bring more funds into the football and continue otherwise the work, which the previous chairman Ivan Hašek began.
“As a chairman I would like to dedicate myself to the football as whole one.”
Begun from the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional football, up to the achievement football for the youth.”
“With it I do not want to say that I want to make everything alone”, said for Rajchl in the discussion for ČTK.
“I am a team player and would like from there the authority in the executive committee in such a way to distribute that each member dedicates itself to a certain range.”
And I will distribute hard tasks, advance thus the football in each segment with mile steps.”
Over it many not straight would be delighted, because them would have to begin to work, instead of criticizing only the work of others, now even really hard”, added it.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement considered of not standing as a candidate no more.
“Of me it is well-known that I work 20 hours on the day.”
“However I must know the fact that it makes sense and that stands for humans behind me, who do not throw incessantly clubs to me between the legs and question, said each step, which I make,” he as explanation, why he hesitated.
“Many people said to me however that I was not allowed to give up, because otherwise also different would do it.”
“That is confidence, which one may not to squander”, said he.
Allegedly motivates it also to be allowed to continue the work which it began under Hašek.
“In two years we mastered a large piece of work and that do not want I now not simply to throw away.”
“Processes were started, which become effective probably only into a few years and I would see only reluctantly the fact that someone stop”, he meant her and expresses hereby his doubts that if the other candidate selected himself - Miroslav Pelta the situation into the times before Hašek return could.
“I believe in systematic action and that am something that does not bring Mirek Pelta.”
“Behind it stand above all people, which would make the football in such a way that it would only be there for chosen one.”
One can probably accuse some to me, but not that I would be biased.”
“I strive to be objective.”
“I want football for all, because it can then to all well and, Rajchl did not only notice the chosen one”.
It contradicts also the statement, it is only one chairman of the Czechs.
“Even if some people maintain the opposite, I intend really to do the optimum for Moravia.”
“For example it is to be considered time, whether one should not divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, their winner then into the first league ascended in each case.”
“Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs in the league played, which for the young players in Moravia a problem is particularly”, means Rajchl.
Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík the fight for the function of the chairman followed, Rajchl does not dare to estimate its opportunities that he is selected.
“I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which selected me to its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes behind me stand”, stated for Rajchl, also the saving of tens of million crowns for disadvantageous contracts, which agreement of television contracts and the negotiations regard around the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand it gives itself partially the debt for the fact that the federation does not pull on only one strand.
While he says of Pelta, “he is from the beginning disqualified, the Czech football to new confidence to help”, regards he to the second rivals - Paclík as a strong candidate, who has to offer to the football really somewhat.
“Nobody can question that it carried out for only one year in Pilsen into distinguished work.”
“He should be selected, then he the things would probably continue introduced, the Ivan Hašek and also personnel occupation in the commissions he obviously not in principle would change.”
It would want surely to sort out the things not to its favor”, judges to Rajchl of its rivals.
