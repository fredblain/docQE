Disputed plan of an oil pipeline is revised after endangerment by delayed US-approval
Few days, after the Obama government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada into the gulf from Mexico to with which one annoyed the trade unions and calmed environmentalists down at the same time, is the pipeline building enterprises endeavored to plan the project again so that one can return again to normality.
TransCanada said evening on Monday that one will reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The enterprise announced the decision at a press conference in parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the enterprise was further confident, which is finally approved the pipeline although with another process.
For this it came to an announcement of the State Department in the past week, after which one would postpone one a decision concerning a federal permission for the project, until the new possible process was examined, that the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply, avoids.
“This is a genuine step ahead”, said the republican Lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska, opposite Fox News.
The new environmental examination, which arranged the State Department, may postpone a decision to 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even if an official denial that politicians were involved into the decision.
Obama explained past week in a written explanation the fact that the decision was a task of the State Department and assured its support.
The 1700-Meilen-Pipeline became Canada with the gulf of Mexico to connect.
It would pump 700,000 barrels oil per day from the province Alberta to the refineries to Texas.
For this the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but job markets love her, because them estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators of Nebraska, that are against the plan, weigh the laws, in order to force a break with the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study to the influence on the environment of the State Department found out that the project would have only little influence on the environment, but the source of the energy industry meant that requested main examiners of the Ministry a separate probe of the examination procedure, on two questions concentrates.
One is whether a lobbyist, which was adjusted by TransCanada is Paul Elliott, who was a 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton in a clash of interests.
The other one is whether an enterprise, which was assigned to accomplish the original study was an inadequate choice, since it stands with TransCanada in connection.
