The threat is seizable
After uncovering the “Zwickauer cell” Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology”, which revives now again.
The murders at eight Turkish-born and a Greek little businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background.
To this message in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern one reacts.
Because for many German Turks thereby a ghost for a long time dead-believed returns: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 it gave no more comparable force with right-extremist background against Turks.
The fact that there is hatred of foreigners in Germany nevertheless never stood in question.
The uncovered right-extremist network reveals however extents, whose dimension is still for a long time not foreseeable.
“Does the bloody ideology live?” the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper “Haberturk” headlined.
The newspaper “Sabah” however stressed that one is to have been the perpetrator a V-man of the protection of the constitution, and shows up anxiously that also German authorities could be entangled in the right-wing extremist sump.
Deliberated the Turkish community Germany reacted: It reminded on the weekend with a memorial vigil before the Brandenburger gate of the victims of racist force.
Only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish enlisting agreement had thought.
In merry colors with one another had been produced - as a history of success.
Like a slap there the reporting of some Turkish media works: Of “Germany gift to the fiftieth one” the heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform “Haber X” reads, which reports the background of the series of murders.
Also the Germany edition of the “Hürriyet” cannot be taken it to draw this mental connection.
“It catches on too to stink”, is called the title of the column of Külahci.
It stresses in the fact that humans were murdered, the taxes would have paid and with their work an important contribution for the reconstruction of Germany would have made.
In German-Turkish Internet forums the action of the police and their late search success are discussed extremely critically.
Why it occurred to the German authorities not already much rather to look in right-extremist circles for suspects the authors are surprised.
Some one shows up at least rhetorically ready for drastic means: “One geschlampt here further, then nothing else remains for the migrants as self-defense and the armament”.
“That will be probably best self protection”.
“Of the quality of the clearing-up and suitability of the punishment of the entire network very strongly the internal peace in Germany off”, writes “Selen” hangs.
Which means it, if the internal peace in Germany in danger is, the attacks clarified of Mölln and Solingen in the 90's.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the here living Turk more clearly that there is a seizable threat, and the German that distrust and distance can flow in right force.
The attacks sharpened however of feeling of togetherness on Turkish side.
The errors of the past do not repeat
In the Turkish press above all the failure of the German policy was criticized at that time after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused visiting the survivors from Mölln to.
After the arson attack of Solingen it sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president, let themselves on the funeral service in Cologne however from his minister of foreign affairs Klaus Kinkel represent - Kinkel enumerated at that time in its speech, how many deliveries carried the local Turks out.
Completely so, as if compute yourself the value of humans after the height of its tax deliveries.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows once again, how deep since then the distrust of many German Turks is into the local rule of law.
Apart from the efforts of an extensive clearing-up and re-valuation of the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
