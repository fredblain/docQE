Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM developed with polymers modified Asphalte, in order to make the mixture more resistant in relation to climatic conditions and variations in temperature
It became on the indications which proceed from the road surfacing, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city range of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and insured that if laying and the maintenance of the asphaltic surfacing out would happen appropriately, which number of potholes is substantially decreased or avoided even completely.
In its lecture of “potholes from technical view”, which it held on the occasion of the international year to chemistry, announced it that the laboratory, for which it is responsible with polymers modified Asphalte develops, in order to manufacture the asphalt similar a mixture, which exhibits however a larger mechanical resistance both with high as well as at low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera meant that this kind of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate should be used to improve as for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order the behavior of the road surfacing and to avoid thus the occurrence from potholes to.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon connection, of the one part a high molecular weight has - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. They lend its characteristic of tough reading table behavior together to the road surfacing.
Tough reading table behavior of the asphalt meant that this behaves at high temperatures of nearly 180°C like a liquid, with 120°C it is very viscous and with 50°C nearly firm, while he becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
“That is, that the ruggedness of the asphalt on the roads is not homogeneous, but on one day as a function of the climatic conditions and variations in temperature”, implemented chemistry engineer changes.
The researcher of the FQ noticed, which would have roads of Mexico City by the majority a flexible road surfacing, which consists of six material layers, from which the last three asphalt contained.
Between the highest layers lies a wear course from asphalt, which consists of small and then solidified stones bathed in asphalt.
Each individual little stone of this wear course, was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move themselves on it and forces are produced, this layer makes a good strength distribution possible in the road surfacing.
“If it modified asphalt would be, the forces still better would distribute”, meant themselves a chemistry engineer.
“Over the wear course”, he implemented, “a last layer is laid out, the so-called base, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which was bathed also in asphalt.
Since this layer in the contact with the vehicle tires are, they need a larger mechanical strength than the wear course and them must manufacture friction.
This road surfacing most forces receives and distributed, needs the base in addition an appropriate thickness and the material, of which it consists, must be held.
The climatic conditions, in particular humidity and variations in temperature, are further, important factors, first of all the water”, which can be considered, said it, “it impair the behavior of the wear course substantially.
If the area becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and steps only with difficulty. A softening of all layers of the road surfacing causes and consequently the occurrence of potholes.
If a pothole develops, said” it, “first cleared away the surface layer, while the wear course is only impaired thereafter. But the damage results, but this concerns a process, to that not immediately with the first signs from appropriate maintenance programs to be held would have.”
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load was a further important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore the thickness of each layer of the road surfacing must always stand in relation to the vehicle load and it must be guaranteed that for the avoidance of frequent potholes this regulation is kept.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that still many research work took time, for example over asphalt emulsions, which even already were in other countries on the market, and with which the potholes let themselves repair simply and without application of high temperatures.
