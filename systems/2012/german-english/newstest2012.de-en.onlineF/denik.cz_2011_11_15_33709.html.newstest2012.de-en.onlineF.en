No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by the parliament
The Ukrainian parliament refused today the request to abolish in the context of a novella of the penal code that paragraph on whose basis the leader of the Opposition Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The new regulation, which could have smoothed the way to the freeing of the arrested Expremierministerin, rejected the delegates with the second reading of the request for moderating the punishments for economic crimes.
Timoshenko had been condemned in October because of the conclusion of an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia over the purchase from natural gas to seven years detention.
The judgment is not valid yet, in December is the appointment of the condemned ones before court to be negotiated.
Timoshenko calls the judgment political revenge of the regime and also in the west let the process the suspicion of the prepossession of the court arise.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on whose basis the Expremierministerin was condemned, from the penal code became from 147 delegates supported.
226 voices would have been necessary for its acceptance.
