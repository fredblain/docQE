Sister Mexican president loses apparently choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon states, whom drug dealers opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in running around the governor post supported.
The sister of president Felipe Calderon apparently lost her application around the office of the governor von Muchoacan during the violent state elections. It stated on Monday, drug dealer a running in favor of one of their opponents would have affected.
After the provisional results Fausto Vallejo of the institutional party of the revolution, won the PRI, a running around the governor post in the western state.
“The intervention of the organized crime during entire choice elections and on the day of yesterday is particularly alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country”, Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview said one day after the choice on Sunday.
“You threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys… you polling booths occupied, road blockades developed… and humans assigned to be correct [for the PRI].”
The PRI governed seven decades in Mexico, until they lost the presidency in the year 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan are an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have struck Claderon only scarcely, which had still led in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of their brother, refused, recognizing Vallejo as winners.
Silvano Aureole, the candidate of the left democratic revolution party PRD, at present still acting governor, came at place three, a heavy defeat for the split and luckless left guidance for the presidential election 2012.
Also Aureole refused recognizing the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug dealers and pushes the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan was controlled long time by drug trusts, which in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines to have specialized.
It is the homeland of president Calderon and it Michoacan chose to start in December 2006 a militarily led offensive against drug dealers.
The force persists still.
A PAN mayor was killed one week before the choice during an election meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates of fear of the local elections stepped out.
For the PRI a victory the party, no matter, strengthens as distastefully the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man, who will probably represent the PRI in running around the presidential office, is Enrique Pena Nieto, which congratulated and said to Vallejo from Washington: “I think that this victory lets us look courageously in the next year.”
