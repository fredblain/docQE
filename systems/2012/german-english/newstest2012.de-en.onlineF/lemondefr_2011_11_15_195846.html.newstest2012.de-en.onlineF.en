The CDU suggests selecting the European Union-president due to general casting of votes
The first day of the congress of the Christian democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig ran for Angela Merkel, Kanzlerin and chairman of the Christian democratic party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally in the program intended, but has itself in the autumn implemented, in particular in order that activists out is sufficient to carry, which estimate the government policy tomorrow regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy as too lax.
The presidency request of the European commission suggested by the presidency was nearly unanimously accepted.
Under 1001 nine delegated against it had been correct, ten of the voice had only contained.
The several minutes continuous standing ovation, which were valid for Angela Merkel as well as some hours of late Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees first, do not lieβen on the part of the three to Europeancourse-bend Ministers of Finance any doubt openly.
The main idea of the chancellor carries - just like the request - the following slogan: the answer to the crisis reads " not less, but more Europes”.
Alone, because Europe peace means, but also there " nine million jobs are not directly on the euro dependent”.
For the chancellor " the time for a break-through came into Europe”.
This could come by control of the European union encouraging modification of the Lissabonner of contract regarding the budget politics of the countries in the Eurozone to the expression\; likewise this could flow however in the choice of the president of the European commission on basis of general casting of votes” to lend around Europe a face”.
This is however in any case one of the request proposals adopted by the congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Surely it is only little probable that the 47 agrees rapidly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is faces the thing rejecting, and the directions of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is.
The milestone is however put.
Likewise the delegated ones in an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the EZB executive committee according to the weighting of the individual Ökonomien, which would bring obviously a Erstarkung to the position of Germany with itself.
The chancellor considered on calming of the climate within its party from there to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl strengthened the points of reference. It did not try however no more to win itself their congress at the expense of the " small” or the European countries in difficulties which would criticize arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the European request dedicates a paragraph to the significance of the " French-German friendship”, Angela Merkel France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds of the fact that Leipzig stood two centuries ago in the center of a bloody battle.
Actually one zuhöchst humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
