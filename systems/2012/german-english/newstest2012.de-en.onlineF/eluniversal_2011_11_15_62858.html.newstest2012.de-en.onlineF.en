The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details over the aircraft accident, with which the government secretary Francisco Blake and further seven persons died.
Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transport - SCT (secretariat for communication and transport in Mexico) informed that the test results point out over the accident, in which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and further seven persons died that the helicopter with its whole intact structure hit directly against the ground, without the pilot could have introduced a forced landing.
At a press conference mentioned Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communication and transport that the pilot before the start would have confirmed, the climatic conditions was suitable for the flight.
“Circumstances that the propeller blades into 25 meters height contact with trees had, whereby the helicopter lost the trunk seems to point out that the helicopter had had several ground contacts.”
He explained also that the helicopter for 19 passengers was built, why it fulfilled all conditions for the transport of the personnel.
In addition said it that during the investigations in the area, in which the machine had come down no helicopter parts were found.
“With the search no airplane parts in other places were found, the impact concerned the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, why it fulfilled all conditions for the transportation of passengers.
The area exhibits a diagonal from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present it is priority to get the test results as soon as possible however can these several months, perhaps even one year take.
_for his part insure Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for airplane and emergency service in Mexico), that the helicopter of Estado Mayor Presidencial with impact with speed fly and the airplane on a soft slope please be.
“This information strengthens the acceptance that it concerned at the time of the impact a normal flight operation.”
At a press conference the director/conductor of SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, enumerated which should be considered during the investigation:
Visual flight:
In conformity with the flight standards it acted around a flight according to the rules of the visual flight. That means that the crew must have had sufficient view during the flight and at the ground.
Climatic conditions:
The AICM registered suitable climatic conditions when starting. During the far flight in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state some deeply hanging clouds drew up.
Selected air lanes:
It is possible that the crew had selected a lower area with better view because of the clouds in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact place:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly it gave a control loss over the airplane still another deviation from the air lane before the impact neither.
Scattering the remnants of the airplane in a limited area:
Up to the current time these information points to the fact that the helicopter had struck out straight lines and lateral direction.
It lets the sample of the scattered airplane remains assume that the helicopter with its intact structure had struck the ground.
No referring to fire or explosion:
The remnants of the airplane offer at the site of the accident suggest neither on fire nor explosion.
The last test results point to several ground contacts.
During the investigations locally airplane parts on a height of 9200 foot over the sea level were found. The area descends and exhibits a diagonal from seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence, in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information points to the fact that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minuziösen search in an area, which went beyond the locked range at the site of the accident, no scattered airplane parts could be found, what strengthens the acceptance that the intact airplane structure had hit against the ground.
