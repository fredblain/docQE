Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows already its losers.
Muammar Al-Gaddafi is because of an unknown place in the desert buried and without it is the war past.
Now the winners are to be only defined.
Like it to this region usually, Islamists, the question triumph are only in the elections, which - the moderate or the radical.
The national transition advice well-known itself for the customary law of the Schar朝平a, from which one has yes now with God a certain conception.
Libya became the country without crime, because for theft one chops off in short the hand.
Also women should forget thoughts at emancipation as soon as possible, become possible faith renegades executed, and so on.
Instead of only one dictator the society becomes future from mutually attacking trunks by the Koran united.
In short - in Libya an order will prevail, which would be hardly desirable in this country hardly conceivable and above all.
Only - our lifestyle is just not the only one seen probably not and objectively the best and alternation the mentioned Libyan would hardly fit.
So seen is it rather appearing strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves help at all from the disbelieving dogs.
For its apology probably only the fact may serve that the air strikes of NATO were led not by any general from America, but by Allah themselves, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The west does not belong to.
We participated only in a shooting, served the interests of the Islam and our politicians got rid of in the person the dictator of a political allied one, without this would have brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq we rather refrained from a military occupation of Libya.
Thus the local ones a concern are loosely - the expulsion of the cross drivers.
Do the mineral oil enterprises get in addition, without occupation the black gold to the ridiculous price?
Probably hardly and so the west can praise itself finally once with good reason its disinterest in things protection of the human rights.
If this for them the Schar朝平a representatives do not spoil.
