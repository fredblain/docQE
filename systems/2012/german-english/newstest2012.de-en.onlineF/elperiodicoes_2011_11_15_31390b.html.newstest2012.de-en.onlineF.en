Park or mountain?
The architects agree apart from the rowing over the fees with the advertisement.
The urban advertisement over the 16 gates opens the debate over the meaning of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.
Center of the 1980er years, for the high point of the Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), disappeared in the meantime, published this administration their libellous pamphlet over the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as an enormous park in Barcelona city.
It was compared even in figures with the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in the year 1987 the park in the eyes of many became again the upper limit of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few, which does not spread in north south direction, but upward (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as nature park plays with this idea.
As model now no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs served.
One was so far, when the city spent a giant advertisement, consisting of 16 competitions, in September for further entrance gates after Collserola.
Certainly a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either is then, or someone intends to place gates on the country.
The question arises automatically: Collserola, park or mountain?
The advertisement is not only from organizational view, but also regarding a reflection over the city the topic for discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is already nearly a rekurrentes topic, to which two members of these can fall back old served a sentence caste, which meet in the elevator.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare agreements between what three architects from Barcelona think of it, and unites university professors, who applied on the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The advertisement is appropriate.
For Roldán “it is necessary” to speak after the attack on the coast about the “front at the mountains” as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, which was not delivered over the green apples.
“One should proceed from the principle that of Barcelona is largest park the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex”, judges the architect, for whom the title “of gates of Collserola holds” “a lexical trap”: One may introduce themselves it not “as entrances to a park, but be acted as containment of areas, on those must.”
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience concerning town construction, regards the proposal as a “intellectual challenge”, which holds “some dangers”.
Driven due to the “uncertainty, those the organization of a public area nowadays with itself brings” after the experiences from the 1980er years, which had their “swan singing” within the range of the forum.
The first fear is the own containment on what may be cultivated.
“Something to limit always means to specify the next step” to exceed i.e. it.
“One must think about new planning instruments concerning town construction, because the current [referring to the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a genuine disaster.”
Modol, which adheres closer to the question, does not mean simplified, the side of Collserola, which goes toward Vallesana, “can as a park be understood, those toward Barcelona”, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol reminds of the fact that there is already a study of the patronage de Collserola, whom “deaf ears should not discover”, although he is grateful to the city administration that she gave the possibility to its committee to participate in this project “from the first moment”.
In addition it marks that the proximity of the mountains is to the city the letter of consignment, which makes it for the architect possible to participate in the debate although it expresses its “doubts” whether this technical profile the multidiscipline teams brought into being (“, he says exactly the correct”) should train “we architects should only one tool be.”
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the heading of this article is complex, since in the advertisement conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: “16 competitions in the cross section were written out”, say it, “on the axle mountain sea. But there is no profile perspective, those the area in its whole regarded.”
That led at least in its case to the fact that he participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate beside it.
According to its opinion the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is so equipped directly over the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, who a soft transition between city and green belts develops.
