Of Europe most beautiful pools
Leap in the blue
Of Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in UFO optics, splendor pool in Budapest: Who travels by Europe, blue miracle can be experience - and after a city route or a migration the tired legs in jacuzzis rest.
A book shows, where spa is most beautiful in the water.
If iris Meder went in the past one and a half years on search journey, one in its luggage could not be missing: their bathing suit.
Back Ling lying on the water, it looked to marble Putten against, which waited at the pond edge for her highly in ornate arranged domes, it swam, and was astonished over with the utmost care restored art nouveau natatoriums.
If you pleased a bath, she took it immediately into its note book up including worth knowing details over the building method and history of the building.
More architecture historian Meder explored and presents than 200 swimming pools in this way - her now into their straight published book “bath joys”: People natatoriums in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, “buildings of hardcore concrete” in the Taunus.
By 13 countries it led its “journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe”: Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland it visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year old German is a true bath cultural enthusiast.
With sport it does not have much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water is that different.
Annoying only that swimming fans must resign themselves to blue tiles and chlorine stink, while joggers can that beguiling smell of spruce forests inhale or to merry bird twittering in the park listen.
“I asked myself one day, why swimming pools must actually be always so ugly”, say the Meder living in Vienna.
“Thus I began to collect beautiful baths.”
Water surface doubles architecture
Geplät in the leap basin and ethereal sauna oils - the spa factor in baths is so largely, because all senses are served, like that Meder.
And if the designers tried hard, natatoriums can be a true Augenschmaus: “Place of a floor one has a water surface in baths.”
“You, reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the whole building is on the one hand transparent.”
Everything doubles itself optically: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small-sized book of pictures “bath joys” obtain worth knowing on 190 sides over the architecture and cultural history of historical spa oases - however above all desire makes on a leap in the blue.
The pool Sammlerin Meder discovered remarkable copies with its searches in Hungary.
Beside magnificent therapeutic baths like that she found 100 years to old Széchenyi bath in Budapest a nitrathaltiges waters in one URI towards Karsthöhle (cave bath in Miskolc Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins are filled with alkaline water and in a flask-shaped building are (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects however offer many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the whole city in the eye from the inhabitant of Zurich roof bath, one can look in the external pool of a bath in St. Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steambath there is a window, from which one can observe a driving on the ski runway.
The perhaps most unusual pool design expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a straight UFO landed in the alps.
From three upward open bowls it steams in the winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals rise up into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in each swimming pool the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine rose into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell it after sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stink so strongly after fuel oil, which one hardly believes in a health bath to have landed.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen welfare water, which is nearly black and whose mud one sticks at the skin, as soon as one can be slid in the basin - a spa experience of the special art.
At a place iris Meder on their search for beautiful bath places was however also disappointed: When it free and sunbathe in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz to visit wanted, it found a locked terrain.
The 1902 of the architect the Dušan Jurkovic arranged bath were in the meantime closed.
When Meder threw a view by the weathered windows of the red-Weis-yellow art nouveau building, she saw, how weeds between the tiles rampantly grew.
One worked against the decline however in a charmful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace Thermal in bath Wildbad.
This bath has three construction phases already behind itself\; to discover one knows not only neo-Romance elements, which originate from times of its establishment in the year 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which were added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995 the palaces Thermal is the favorite bath of the pool connoisseur iris Meder - and that not only, because she originally originates from the Black Forest.
“It is already an achievement to merge so different architectural styles into a so great unit”, says Meder.
With such a palace is the dipping course in the Thermalpool obviously only secondary matter.
