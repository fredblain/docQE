The possibility the voting cards in Michoacán will count out separately considered
In accordance with the information of PREP the difference between first and the second place amounts to with the choice of the governor scarcely 27 percent, whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
The possibility of the single counting of the voting cards is in this year with the elections in Michoacán a reality, because amounts to in accordance with the data spent by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place with the governor elections scarcely 27 percent, whereby 879 voices were not counted out of altogether 6074 yet.
In this sense the president of the Consejo general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM) reminded, María de loosely Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the fact that straight had adopted the choice place a set from regulations once on past 9 November to the harmonization of the local regulations with the reforms of the Federal States in choice elections.
It is reminded of the fact that Michoacán had adapted neither its political condition nor its electoral law still its law over the choice law to the reforms adopted by the congress, so that these had not stepped with this choice round into force. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided its publication in the official gazette within the periods with the argument, planned for it to have still objections against it.
On 9 November the highest Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional challenge submitted by the local legislation and judged the voice of the state-assigned to the constitutional reforms as “invalidly and illegally”, since this did not have the right, over it “decides or a veto against it to insert”.
María de Ángeles Llanderal explained loosely with an interview over the possibility of the single counting of the voices that owing to the acceptance of the guidelines by the Consejo general would exist del IEM now the possibility that the local election commission could partly or completely count out the voting cards.
So the results in minutes can be partly counted out to be correct not under the following conditions in one or more choice elections contained voices\; the protocol on the counting of votes and - computation is not present documentary or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the election commitee or it gives obvious errors or alterations in minutes.
In addition the total counting of completely filled out ballot papers can take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and that, who stand on the second place, which is same or smaller than a percent, provided at the beginning of the meeting lies an express request Partei-bzw. Coalition chairman forwards, who is second of the candidates mentioned.
The counting of votes can take place also in its whole, if after conclusion of tidy calculation is determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate at the second place is same or smaller than a percent, presupposed it is present an express request of a representative of the party, whose candidate became second. In this case the choice elections, which were exposed to a partial counting, were excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation, where in accordance with PREP the difference between first and the second place amounts to scarcely 0.16 percent, although the voices were not counted out of 129 of altogether 923 choice elections yet.
