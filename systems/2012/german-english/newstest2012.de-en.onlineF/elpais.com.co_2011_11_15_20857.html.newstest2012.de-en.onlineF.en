Provoke the authorities in New York “infuriated”
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in tents at the Zuccotti place.
A majority followed the eviction order and changed its location into a close convenient park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street provoked new Yorks on this Tuesday the authorities, when they tried again with a judicial arrangement, the one having place to enter, after they had been vacated in the daybreak by the place and had tried to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together before the Zuccotti place, on which they wanted to provide with a judicial arrangement, which “infuriated” renewed tents here permitted, admission. Meanwhile another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests.
“Our idea is that, if the court does not permit us at the place to campen, we come together at another place and the battle with legal means around the return to the Zuccotti would continue, also sit in and peaceful demonstrations”, said Marks of Bray, one the spokesman of the movement “Ocupy Wall Street”.
Bray implemented the fact that the answer “infuriated” on the evacuation of its camp, which directly of Michael Bloomberg, who mayor had been arranged of New York, until before court came, where the judge Lucy Billings spent an arrangement, which forbade the evacuation by force of the place and which demonstrators to the tents approved.
In addition occupied “infuriated” a new park, which itself at the crossing of the Canal Street lain central and the Sixth Avenue close by the entry into the Holland tunnel, which connects, finds New York and New Jersey and property of the Trinity Church is.
They could occupy the place at least one hour long. But afterwards the police arrived and arrested some the demonstrators, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. It insured the press agency Efe that he had seen under it also several journalists with handcuffs.
The organization insured, hundreds of humans would here have appeared themselves, at whom also a delegation of religious leaders as indications of their support of the members of the movement and for switching with the police had arrived.
In the meantime the Zuccotti place (an area in private property) remains closed in expectation of a judicial hearing, which is set for this Tuesday still, and with which the legal standard the evacuation taken place in the daybreak is to be analyzed.
Some the demonstrators driven by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement with itself and distributed them. They gave it even unite policemen, who guarded the place, which entailed “some small collisions”, as Bray reported, which had indicated, some policemen would have demonstrators struck.
The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities to vacate members by Occupy Wall Street from the place to as well as the use of “laws, according to occupation it was discharged and to forbid that the demonstrators with their tents and other things, which had used them already before return to the park.”
Mayor Bloomberg gets straight before the press, which was waived due to this judicial arrangement the renewed opening of the place for audience traffic and the demonstrators. The demonstrators pointed out it that the city laws did not permit them to furnish itself again with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor defended personally the evacuation of the Zuccotti place accomplished in the daybreak, with which nearly 200 persons were arrested, and which was decided, because the demonstrators offended “against the right.”
Bloomberg explained, it would have given the arrangement to evacuation of the place, because this had transformed “into a place, to which humans to demonstrating did not come, but for breaking the laws and in some cases, around other persons damage to cause”, because “some business would have threats received” and the adjacents resident feared for “their quality of life”.
“The evacuation in the daybreak was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is interested in the reason in the protection of the financial interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers”, did not add the spokesman of the movement, the mayor accused “freedom of the press not to respect”.
It informed the responsible persons of “Occupy Wall Street” that they would think to organize “large actions” for Thursday together with community organizations and trade unions, in order the two months, which already last the protests since 17 September now to intend.
