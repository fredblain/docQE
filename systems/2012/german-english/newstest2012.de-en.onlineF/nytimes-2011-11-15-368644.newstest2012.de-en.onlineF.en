Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive one and magnanimously begins Peter Englunds new book “beauty and fright. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates” with a long list of main persons, who to hearts goes to one.
Here a hint, as one could proceed: Cut this side out carefully and make you them your bookmark.
They will become acquainted with these humans in Englunds of novelful narration very well. And these main persons will function as your GPS, when lighthouse in these few moments, in which them like Englunds of men and women in the fog of the war lost and are robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is besides a new constant secretary of the Swedish academy, which intends the Nobel Prize for literature.
It wrote an unusual book, which he does not describe without foundation as “a work of anti-history”.
It contains only few large names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly Ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions over tactics and equipment.
It is less a book concerning it which happened, explains it, but rather “a book concerning it, like it was”. It acts of “feelings, impressions, experiences and tendencies”.
“Beauty and fright” nearly the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, of school girls and botanists up to mountain climbers, physicians, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some these humans become heroes.
Some to prisoners of war, lose limb, are moved or to die.
Each of these lives flickers like the Votivkerzen in a church, some is added, while others expire.
Englunds book deviates from the usual story-books.
It corrected in addition the conception, the First World War was only the devastating position warfare at the Western front.
“Beauty and fright” walk with expert view over other theaters: the alps, the Balkans, the Eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book straw hives, one fall celebrate Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book nearly from the outset.
The war inundates the life of these humans like a natural disaster, how a hurricane Katrina, which smells after Kordit.
Imagine, you are a woman, who is with its children at home, and cannon fire in the distance hears. Do you remain seizing or you the escape?
Who comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands, what is passed or why this war is at all led.
“, Then Englund determines missing facts”, “with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors was bucked up.”
“Beauty and fright” follow individual persons such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stump, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were inferred mainly memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be alarmingly or moving, but they are extremely alive in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in details.
Many of them act of lack and managing.
In the history of a German school girl it tells: “Replacement, everywhere replacement.”
“Spare coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper federations, wood buttons.”
It tells more of the spare meal in Germany.
It describes “meat, which was made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and with a wrong bone from wood one served last), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes, those with wood was besohlt.”
There were, like it noted, “837 registered food substitutes, which were permitted in the production of small sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to ferocity and says about the war: “One feels that despite everything that is, which was intended for men rather as in the armchair to sit, with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and to do in such a way, as if mean such a front civilization and as if would not give it barbarism behind the own strengthened and metal-mounted shirt chest.”
Turned around a British soldier recognizes that he probably die and nobody will worry of it note to take or about it.
“If one of the thought to sacrifice itself distances oneself, would like to think one that this happens, writes before an audience” it.
Instead it is as terribly as “a condemned man, that was on the sly hung.”
Other observations act of old Europe, which falls apart, and over new kinds of the terror.
“The conflict became increasing an economic contest”, writes Englund, “a war between the factories.”
It catches the arrival its, which he calls “a new species in the Bestiarium of the still recent century”: “that word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit, which slaughters, during it behind a desk sits.”
Humans behave on unexpected way and it give just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers, who tried actively to be infected with a prostitute with a sex illness in order the field service to escape.
“The grotesque expression its can be discovered in the trade with Gonokokken pus, because soldiers bought and on their genital organs lubricated themselves, in hope, into the hospital to thus come”, write it.
“Those, which had really despaired, rubbed it into the eyes, which led to the fact that they were blind the rest of their life.”
In this translation from Swedish of Peter Graves Englunds poetry becomes supple and nevertheless unobstrusive and adapts perfectly to its human task.
In dozens of small scenes it catches the way, as the war provoked “in unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate”.
Humans begin themselves to ask, why their leaders bring them to fighting.
The best books concerning the First World War were usually rather falsified like Paul Fussells “Great were and decaying MEMORY” or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques “in the west nothing new” as extensive story-books.
Englunds volume joins an unconventional fame hall.
Its book has the most devastating end, from which I read ever in a specialized book.
I do not give it.
But it is, as if it would have snapped us with its book this side with the main persons before the nose and with a match would have ignited.
