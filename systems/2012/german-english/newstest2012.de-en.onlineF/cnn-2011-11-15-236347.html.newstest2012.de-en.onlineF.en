As one a lie unmasks
A view of the current headlines shows, how precariously and far deception and lie spread in the daily life are.
The presidential candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is busy to become the accusations of sexual annoyance on the part of several women gentleman. Both sides accuse themselves mutually of the lie.
The line of doss State the perjury one accuses of, since one held back allegedly reports, after which a retired football coach boy sexual abused.
Heard in the past week over an open microphone, when the French president Nikolas Sarkozy the American president opposite Barack Obama stated, the Israeli prime ministers Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New Yorker congressional representative and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made themselves the fool, when he brought denials in circulation, which were disproved very fast by irrefutable proofs.
The earlier presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the offenses in the campaign financing, which stands in connection with the cover-up of a except-conjugal affair.
And then naturally nobody, which experienced it, forgets the medium circus, president Bill Clinton released, when it lied during its second term of office in the oval Office concerning its sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories over cheating at school and with college examinations are far common.
There were incidents, with which teachers gave their student the test answers, so that they stood there with their achievement examinations well.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, dispatch a message that lies and cheating okay are.
How do we experience much deception?
As studies occupy, we lie each day between 10 and 200 times.
Many these lies are considered however as emergency lies.
Another study shows that mutually three times deceive themselves foreigner during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lies to recognize and/or “lies uncover” is one, which are important for each humans to learn, and this both from personal as well as for vocational reasons.
Far from a parlor game like for example charades, in which it is the goal, “have you!” to call, unmasking a deception a respectable knowledge range, which is based on scientific data, is, which were collected in the course of the past of six decades at respected universities, which accomplished extensive research projects, in particular within the ranges psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths were unmasked over lying.
Lies look one into the eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush and wriggle not always.
From this one may not close however that these liars are to uncover with difficulty and be unmasked.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate to the truth, by he something over the structure of the statement, which purifies facial expressions, over question and timing learns.
I spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing range of unmasking. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability, which is to be learned easily and us in getting along in our complex world helps particularly, if adjusting or the questioning from persons or negotiations or administration belongs to the own vocational responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to estimate other humans to wake whose interest and to control the own emotions. And they feel intuitively, how they are noticed by others.
Owing to the research know we, which extroverted humans lie more frequently than introverted humans that men more frequently “oriented” lies serve than women, their lies more “at others orient themselves” - usually they want to protect thereby the feelings of others - that married humans lie their partners less frequently than unmarried humans (however the lies, which tell them are usually “fat lies”).
We know also that, if a person were unmasked as an evil perpetrator other itself less guiltily feels this person to have lain.
How does one recognize whether someone lies?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
One calls that “Baselining”, the starting position.
It gives a point of reference for later evaluating of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voting quality of their test subject.
They should know better, when someone normally constantly patters with the foot, so that they do not accuse it of to injustice, if it patters during a meeting with the foot.
Then you pay attention to accumulations of remarkable verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Regard these accumulations as alarm bells, which shrill, not as proof of a unmasking.
Perhaps humans, who are deceptive, solidify, if they try to remember their history. Perhaps their feet point toward door or them lean toward exit, change their position to significant way or show a “relaxation after the attitude discussion”, this deep, relaxing breathing out and the change in the attitude, if all hard questions past are.
Asking ones often falsely signal that an attitude discussion past is to only hold in order after this relaxation after the attitude discussion look out.
Pay attention in addition to the language of your test subject.
The slip of Scott Peterson is famous, when it used the past form, when it stated, its killed wife is still alive and a national search for it released.
Deceptive persons can use also a dissociating language: “I did not have sexual relationship with this woman… Measure Lewinsky” or if one repeats a tricky question in the entire one.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some humans use “qualifying language”, if they answer a tricky question: “Now admits… over to you the truth to say… so far me is… after best knowledge and certain.”
Thereby the answer becomes rather perceptive as material, whereby often the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic charm for unmasking lies, but one can learn abilities, owing to which a unmasking is possible.
Owing to these abilities can become rarer each the victim of cheats, both in the private and in the working life.
