Energy policy:
Facts should triumph over dogmas
If a topic exists that on basis by short term views or due to emotions may not be treated, then this is surely the energy policy.
Availability and costs of the electricity affect the purchasing power as well as the competitive power of the enterprises in direct Maβe.
Reasonably, a choice meeting is to be taken to the cause to think about this topic as well as about the position of the nuclear energy.
The debate will carry fruits only if it sounds out the whole of economic, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options.
The Frenchmen should found their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion humans on this planet are, the demographic evolution advances a duplication of the electricity demand up to the year 2050, is not an enormous portion of the world population without a vital element to do to have.
At the same time one must moderate the shortage of fossil resources, in order to be able to produce electricity further steadily, without forgetting the compelling necessity for the decrease of the greenhouse gas missions, a topic, disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Therefore Germany blebt further in its decision in an isolated manner to do without nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision of the necessity to find a substitutionable spare source still in Switzerland, which intends just to only build nuclear power stations of the last generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, in order to call only some states, pursue their projects against it further with determination.
The United States decided for their part after Fukushima to attach their park a further unit by taking the work Three Mile Island shut down after the atomic accident again in enterprise.
Even if, the German model aligned to renewable energy sources is put occasionally as model, then however the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will settle in form of a rise in price of the electricity price, an energetic dependence intensified by the increased resort to import gas in particular of the CO2 emissions caused by Russia, a rise by gas and coal-fired power stations.
The whole of these unpleasant effects will become apparent already within a few months.
The case Denmark gives cause for thinking.
Denmark is on the one hand European table leader regarding wind energy, from which it refers 30% of its electricity, on the other hand one is the country of one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternating used with wind energy\; due to its are its CO2 emissions as well as its electricity price higher around 65% and 50% in each case than the appropriate European average value.
Owing to the stability of our energy policy our neighbors pay an electricity bill higher contrary to our French households around 40%.
Since the energy price in the globalized economy represents a key role of the competitive power as well as a stability pledge of the industry on national ground, the French enterprises have an advantage due to the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction concerning the nuclear power would draw from there a strong increasing of the energy price, which would let the noble statements about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defense of the purchasing power become the illusion.
Surveys showed that the one price was, which is ready the groβe majority of the Frenchmen just as few to pay, as she shows resistance against the principle of this energy source.
We realize that the energy policy of our country made it possible to construct a branch of industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character it brings an enormous amount of specialized small and medium-size enterprises on the international markets and makes this creators of innumerable jobs.
If France should seize the resolution to step out of the nuclear power then a Groβteil of these KMU would fall to the victim, and that would shrink annual 6 billion euros at capital goods and nuclear energy export more and more.
Which electrician would assign a EPR conceived for functioning on sixty years, if the fall pre-programmes its producer is?
Around the energetic equation to solve one must grant that there is just as little as a devil's work a miracle drug for the production of electricity.
Of the company Areva developed, to CO2 arms solutions for the application of nuclear power and renewable energy witnesses from the complementarity of the energy sources.
The highest possible safety level upright too received is for the nuclear power an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security authority, which accomplishes uncompromising and transparent controls in works already existing as for example at the building in Flamanville.
Their teams, which made themselves due to their professionalism a name, straight are too possessed of the safety conception.
Within 50 years the nuclear industry experienced three serious incidents.
More only one, in Three Mile Island, under normal operation conditions entered\; thus it ran without consequences for humans and environment.
In Chernobyl the drama was caused by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure.
With Fukushima it seems to forget some that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented extent, the death of several ten thousand humans caused.
The nuclear industry will draw its teachings likewise from this accident, as it had done this after the two preceeding.
When, the EPR a draft represents fruit of this approach as well as a co-operation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and technical designers of nuclear power stations, which makes ruggedness for it possible in relation to such phenomena.
Since it is judged among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power station then a suspension of building work would be in Flamanville a marvelous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by leaving free course to them to actually tear the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country however it would be irresponsible, emotions, to let dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate the just as economic, social and financial situation of our country determined.
