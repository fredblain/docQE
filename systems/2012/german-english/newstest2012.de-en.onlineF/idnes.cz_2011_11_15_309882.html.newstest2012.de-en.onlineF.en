V Need for speed: “The run” - illegal running straight through America
Review
The originally carefree trip becomes by a series completely avoidable, dilettante error the routine trip the early shift.
It succeeded to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent but which that uses already, if obviously nobody had desire to do a little more.
Already before he came on the counters, the new part with the sub-title “The run” created high expectations.
It promised nevertheless to shift the play series of “Need already bejahrte for speed” piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples seemed it actually not only one from many Action Rennspielen to be.
We were also curious, as the fit in passages fail, in which the main protagonist from the car rises and continues to foot.
But like one it with NFS is already accustomed, is eventually much different, than one had expected.
Surely - there is potential quite decent arcade running, but altogether the play is diminished by some redundant errors, which are long present more or less already in this series a few years.
Thus there is actually no more errors, but rather signs incomprehensible of a in principle laziness of the play developers.
The adventure begins very well.
For a start one is introduced to the history, whose main figure Jack has certain problems of a personal character\; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race straight through America.
In San Francisco, thus at the west coast, one sits down to the steering wheel - with the task to be than first in New York.
The philosophy contains a whole number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty individual running.
That means that each running on other distance is delivered and that the individual stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting environment take place.
One does not have a moment the impression that play would offer the same again and again.
Some environments are to be regarded in addition still expressed prettily, although the technical level of the diagram does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
Thus nothing worldshaking.
But the trip by the desert, by autumnal landscape or highly above by deeply snow-covered landscape work visually very pleasantly.
Now and then atypical elements bring little alternation into individual running.
In the desert for example one is surprised by a desert storm, which limits the view strongly.
In the mountains again one must watch out infernally that one is not buried by an avalanche.
Besides are quite well one behind the other an individual running inserted.
Only few, but they are enough.
One while one tries in such a way, which prescribed number from opponents to overhaul (in principle classical running), then one has time to catch up (classical running against the stopwatch), then expects still another personal duel with only one contractor.
And in addition also still the police interferes, which wants the whole thing vermasseln.
A novelty are passages, in which Jack leaves the car.
It concerns rather certain interactive animations, in which Jack flees forwards possibly someone and where the player him must help, by pressing the correct button in the correct moment.
Thus nothing complication.
It surprises however that it gives in the play much less such passages, when one (concretely probably only three) would expect.
Finally this is the thing rather for the advantage, because so this element has at least no opportunity to become boring - it belongs in the context to said the above to the elements, which make the play more varied.
The driving model walks into the Fußtapfen of the preceding parts.
That is, seen by today's focus, it tears no trees out, on the other hand one one could not state, it would be bad.
Who looks for realistic simulations, must look around elsewhere.
But a action-loaded running driving becomes also further completely well fair the local driving model, although one could find with the competition better.
By then so far everything is best correct.
Genuine problems emerge only after certain time.
Contrary to the driving model the collision model is not whole o.k.
It is hardly to be expected by a play of this kind that it complicated deformations and collisions computed, but if one has practically before no impact on possibly an object notion, how the car behaves, then is obviously not everything correct.
Typical example: With close overhauling or driving past at accomodating cars one “touches” the other car in some places only easily, in other, almost identical situation comes one however into hurling and turns wild pirouettes.
Or the cart drives equal too scrap iron.
Owing to the restart system that constitutes nothing else, off annoying always is it.
The restarts are so solved: if one has total loss or far off the distance lands, then the play throws back to the last reference point of the distance.
Only - in each running one has only five restarts.
If one exhausted it, everything starts from the front.
The restarts are thus rather something like an aid, if somewhat does not succeed, but on it abandoned should one itself rather not.
Sometimes however times the restart does not help, there helps nothing else to learn as the critical section by heart.
It is expressed unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
One must drive through some curves for example in completely specific way, otherwise one does not fit simply through.
One meets civilian” cars elsewhere in the appropriate place “always in same configuration, no matter whether one comes as first or fifth, five seconds in former times or one minute later.
That is particularly in situations annoying, if one sees the fact that the contractor goes past before easily at two coming to meet cars but until one arrives there, is the cars already in such a position that one must circumvent or brake her.
And it is no matter, when one arrives there, everything is in such a way that conceived it comes to this situation always closely before your nose.
The contractors have still further advantages.
Generally speaking play gives it to a few places, where one is always overhauled in the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration on the time.
At the craziest one this is for the conclusion of the play on the long bridge, which one passes in opposite direction.
The contractor must one obviously on devil comes here out to overhaul.
And if it is already before one, then it takes the view naturally, so that one at the beginning of the own car a few marks in become lumpy there drives.
Clearly - one wants to make the play for simply exciting and more exciting however this intention is so clear that she spoils fast the joy in the play.
And that is unfortunate, because despite simpler driving model is the play altogether quite entertaining and also in parts so action that one does not know nearly no more, where the head stands for one.
And in principle it is no matter which “debt” to it actual concept with fifty singular routes, the arrangement that running on a way that no boredom can arise, or somewhat completely different one…
An unusual idea is also the car change in the run that running.
One may not survey thereby the gas stations at the distance, because straight here one can change the car, although the car is in most cases sufficient, which one has straight.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well for the urban ranges suitably, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic supersports cars for the technical trips, for example on the zigzags in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode to play history also the task mode (challenges) goes - thus running in the individual localities, which one knows from history.
Here there are not only medals to win but also points of experience for the own profile which is common for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to arrive at the higher driver level, different articles must be unlocked: of the car begun, up to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time connected with the ONLINE function autolog, which among other things the own obtained results with those other player compares and even for further collective functions provides.
One of further incomprehensible gaffes is a situation in last running of history.
Here one comes with the car into an underground tunnel (on my account), where one races in the dark on the rails long (on my account).
On the Tacho numbers between 150 A 200 km/h (on my account) look, but come there at once from the rear an underground and drive one uncompromisingly to scrap iron.
In our editorship we will argue probably still for a long time about whether that was a blackout of the play designers or whether the authors consider us so dumb.
The technical side is however at least the visual general impression is in most cases quite responding nothing overwhelming and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the image repetition frequency becomes slower and this every now and then rather dramatically.
That concerns however in particular the accidents with larger number of taking part, where a continuous FPS uses anyway nothing.
The sound reproduction is so far o.k. and that soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In the effort to address a as broad as only possible scale of rather recent audience a soundtrack A developed lá “of each somewhat” - however who buys such a play already because of the music?!
The general impression of Need for speed: The run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the play were not diminished due to the mentioned totally unnecessary errors, we could have stated with the chest tone of the conviction that The run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.
But the play works in such a way somehow incompletely.
On for itself a class a pleasure, but one should be preparatory for the fact that these errors with the power of airport headlights sting into the eyes.
