What represents the fraud with sick notes?
After the family allowance UMP and government tackle now the sick notes.
Nicolas Sarkozy becomes on the Tuesday, which 15 November in Bordeaux arrive, in order to visit a family allowance cash and to state a speech over - already since 2007 always recurring - the topic of the fight against social fraud as well as economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which proceeds from the tendency to submit the economy in a hardness test on which however not less harbinger of an axle of the right presidency campaign represents other side, wants the majority on employee sick notes to concentrate.
First with an household-economical goal: the government visiert the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before consideration of a sick note at employees in the private sector on.
On well German this that a gotten sick employee without grant of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, means thus thus at least 15% of its monthly income.
A Maβnahme, which threatens to cause according to the daily paper of " Les Echos” anger, would help however to bring in 280 million euro.
And with another Maβnahme of a rather symbolic character would go: the civil servant a unvergüteten Karenztag in the medical case to grant (so far there is no waiting period for it, in contrast to the three waiting periods in the private sector,).
Meanwhile these questions in the discussion stand, kindle the majority likewise again the fraud topic, whereby this time the abuse connected with work absence one aims at.
“Controls will be substantially more important, and beyond that these are to be backrecompensed, if this is demanded”, warned Xavier edge of praying on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As also in other cases the effects of this message seem a little disproportionate regarding the reality of fraudulent actions in ranges of the sick notes.
This is indeed already since 2002 article of permanent observation as well as more politically offensive ones, which carried most frequently fruits.
The Frenchmen are not more frequently ill any longer than persons of other place one in Europe.
We stay however first with the country-wide numbers.
According to the national health insurance company CNAM in the year 2006 more than 237 million euro daily compensations were disbursed.
Gemäβ of the economic research and institute for documentation of the health service represented the daily compensations in the year 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of the expenditures for health.
Under this amount 46% fell concerning maternity leave as well as concerning industrial accidents and 54% illness vacation, heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% expenditures for health.
In the year 2010 in relation to the 17.8 days in the year 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting group of on the average only 14.5 patient days were entitled to the Frenchman.
An average value, which hushes up certain differences: another, in the year 2007 by Monster.com, was published Website for career management, pointed that 75% of the 40. 000 asked, French employee out indicated, not one patient day to have taken.
Another, this time of the health insurance seized study gets straight that 37% of the sick notes were in the year 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days\; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between and three months and 11% over it.
Compared to their European neighbors the French employees do not tend thus any longer than elsewhere to inability to work.
One in the year 2010 of two researchers of the French, national center for science research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence ratio (illness or otherwise justified) reciprocated, in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the united kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud with sick notes represents a infinitesimal small portion regarding the moonlighting.
Concerning the fraud only a weak Ausmaβ is reached here.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 brings with itself that there are systmatische controls with sick notes, which exceed 45 days.
In the year 2008 the CNAM (public university for out and further training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls determined that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized, short term sick notes, which was heiβt in 37.050 cases”, unjustified or too long”.
With the systematically controlled cases of sick note of more than 45 days duration counted one under 1.2 million 11% at " maladjusted or unjustified” cases, heiβt 132.000.
Altogether this makes thus 169,000 " unjustified” cases on several millions employees, which made a sick note valid.
A number, which only a weak Ausmaβ represents opposite for example that the moonlighting.
According to the UMP delegate Dominique Tian, author in July of a special report regarding this question, appeared, represents this between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss of earnings per year, i.e. more as the total costs at daily remuneration, and thus substantially more than the fraud with latter.
