More than 20 years were expected it, but it insures the volume that for them a dream realizes itself, if they play in Costa Rica.
The insured bassist and joint founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The volume is in the South American part of its tour for the celebration of its twenty-year-old existence and on Sunday, the 20. , they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they step starting from 19.30 o'clock in the national stadium as well as the volumes The X from Los Angeles and picked Robertas up from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the discussion, whose complete copy in the online edition of La Nación is to be found.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream realizes itself, if Pearl Jam in Costa Rica plays: Are conscious to it you, which means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream, which realizes itself also for us.
Up to now that is straight once the second time that we play in south and Central America, and it was great.
I was only once to the vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so beautiful country that we will remain certainly still a few days there.
For us it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you that, because the fans that are completely devoted volume. They experience the days before the concert intensivst.
What says it to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thanks to stand all these years at our side.
We used nearly 21 years, until we came to Costa Rica. Thanks to have so for a long time waited and suffering does to us to have so for a long time used until we came here.
Some people are even the opinion that your concert will become the largest show of the year.
Doesn't that exert a little pressure from your visit?
Some the greatest shows, which we put down in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We played for a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we to hope that for this concert in Costa Rica made us fit.
Really, we have to play desire there.
We love this country, we surf and are enthusiastic from the jungle. But Costa Rica belongs to the best countries in the world.
How their Costa Rica and their waves for surfing became acquainted with?
Many our friend are surfers and I have a great friend, who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends always drove for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico that is outstanding areas for surfing. In this way, over people, which love a surfing, we experienced of it.
With a view of the tour giant shows with many songs to it ordered.
Which plans have you for the meeting in Costa Rica?
Since we did not play there ever, we sit down also no borders.
We will try to give the optimum show with many different songs. We want to play a few song from each album and to our fans a good and versatile repertoire offer.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe, that am partially like that, because we can have and over 120 songs play nine plates. Another song pleases everyone, so that the decision, which we will play in each case, falls not easily.
If we two or three of song, whom we did not play already longer no more, take up, to the repertoire, we can receive our concentration better upright and them to surprise us, because they call us the reasons in the memory, why us this song to have fallen. Otherwise they could come into oblivion.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believes, therefore also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year-old history.
If you look back, does it fall you heavily in your success to believe?
Yes, totally.
First of all I believe that nobody from us itself presented to play once in great rock band and also still over 20 years long. That works like a dream.
We continue to set also on this benedictions and find it great to be able to still make still together music.
We like us and are enthusiastic to bring music out.
We have luck to be able to drive to the places of the world which we wanted to visit always once.
The things could not stand better.
What meant it for you in the birth of the Grunge to have participated actively?
It was always an honor to belong to this group large volume.
We are well friendly with the people of sound guards, Mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and plentifully unusual, if a movement comes out from a group of friends.
Now and then a volume comes out from a city, but it is already unusual, if five or ten groups come at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we would interaction still.
In the last year we were on a festival with Alice in chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound guards on their tour. We are pleased to be friendly still with them all and it honour us to be part of this arisen Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a volume stayed together like your a time so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us would interaction already for 21 years and matte (Cameron) pushed before 13 years to us. Alone already is much more time, than many volume outlast.
First of all I that we estimate ourselves all happy, believe to be still alive and in addition worry we over each other.
We all are confine friend, why musical ways opened, which give the freedom to each particular for experimenting.
One trusts the other one and its music. We could not be better.
Your relationship with the fame was not always simple. On the other side could always make owing to your success that for it, what their most wanting.
How do you find a balance?
The kind, how we grew, made it simpler for us to find a balance.
We guarantee to not often be too on tour because it is too easy to purge to this play with enormous human being masses, which love your music.
As long as one remembers that the people came because of the music, reminds you that of it that you must respect the music and what brought her into being, without obsessed on it to be a famous rock star to be. That anyway never interested us.
Which memories do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone?
I believe, we have very good of song written and at the beginning was it great.
We were three years long a volume, which had never published a plate up to the death of Andy (Andrew Wood).
We were disappointed to have so for a long time used. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), which with us the volume constructs, gets used to. If I hear a song or see photos, I remember, what for unbelievable humans were Andy and how he brought me to the laughter. It was always a joy to go to the work to laugh and at music and football and many other topics talk together.
He was an extraordinary person and we misses him.
The domestic volume read Robertas is responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Does it that you know her work, tune in particular Eddie Vedder, and the volume therefore for the opening selected?
Yes, production sent videos of several groups and this volume to us pleased us best. Therefore we are to be seen curiously, what read Robertas live offer can. That certainly stretching.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you play live?
That is a question for OD (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
It sings it, and I believe, he sing first, which occurs to him.
Were you affected of whom as bassist?
Of so many +
To first, which occur to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. to J. Ramone, belong John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski…
There is so many that I could talk the whole afternoon about the bassists, which please me.
How did it create Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge alive although it does not concern no more a temporary fashion?
I believe, we all do not feel us not much obliged with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, occur to me the volume, which I mentioned before, for example the Mudhoney, sound guards, nirvana and all different, which arose at the same time. Even if they are still important today, I find that great, because it is worthwhile itself to hear and volume such as Mudhoney make this music now improves music as ever before.
At first their music was more darkly, now is more positive it.
Why?
That is interesting, because I believe, it give a few song on the new album, which could work somewhat thoughtlessly. But there are also different songs such as The ends or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark song, although they also something positive have actually.
To both me the tears came, when I heard like OD them played. There is much darkens song.
I believe, if you older and somewhat traumatic in your life happened actual e.g. loses if one a relative or a friend - your artistic work and your music affects and this both song embodies clearly for me.
In addition, I am the opinion that one can make happy humans its and nevertheless dark music.
