European union-ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of negativists and euro sceptics
“The contract of Lisbon brought the balance under the individual institutions perceptibly from the plumb bob.”
I would not have expected that such is inflamed a hard war.”
“It will take five, six years, to itself and will have gotten accustomed all to their new role”, began Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador will have smoothed the waves with the European union, quite sharply their lecture at the legal faculty.
How seriously it takes the slogan “understandable and openly over Europe”, she already showed in the first part of her lecture, in which it succeeded to it to describe the individual organs of the European Union and their mutual relations in such a visible and understandable way that she could have envied so some lector of the legal faculty of the Karl university therefore.
Mrs. Vicenová praised thereby also the new constant chairmen of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“Beginning became loud criticism, it is too inconspicuous - a grey official, who did not grow such a role, but I must say, leave speechless it has everything, how well it took care of the thing.
“It is to be communicated humans, who bring it completely to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently with them and above all clear conceptions of it has, how it is to continue with the European Union.
The new position of the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy explained it then as answer to the question: Who is that actually - the European union? Which number am I to call? ”, thus as important step for the agreement and better readableness of the EU policy in relation to states, like e.g. China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid our Ölmützer Quargel to us
Mrs. Vicenová dedicated herself also to the agenda, in accordance with which the European union lived, lives and intends in the near future to live.
It called the Czech presidency from forwards two years success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and would have organized also the summit for eastern partnership.
It called the case of the government during the presidency large Negativum, which had strongly harmed the image of the Czech republic.
The Czech agency in the European Union has to do all hands at present fully.
With the words said, it reached to the ambassador not only with the presidency, but also with the following crisis, which is today not yet overcome until, quite hectically.
And there still the seven-annual budget of the European Union must be approved of, what makes the thing straight many more complicated because of the today's economic situation.
Whether it becomes a slim and economical budget, which industries receive priority, which countries more are promoted less and which - all this stands now on the agenda.
The ambassador reminds also of her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: “Understandable over Europe”.
“If I somewhat do not like, then there is greyish contractions, foreign words and jargon, which nobody understands.
As I am to actually know as citizens whether one invents in Brussels really bent or round cucumbers and differently large bananas or whether someone wants to actually forbid the Quargel to us.
She would have used the ground of the European Union also gladly in order to get more Czech into European institutions.
Europe of the two or different speeds in prospect
According to opinion of the European Union-ambassador the Czechs stand in the call to be euro sceptics more the negative, than the positive sides of the thing notice.
The weak agency of Czechs is all the more annoying in European institutions.
Many factors debt, among other things also the restraint of our candidates, are their inability, to write motivation letters and not least also the weak support of the Czech side.
Except the successful Czech presidency main header it also the strength and co-operation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4 out.
“Faith you me, if poles or Hungarian comes to me and is a Slovak in the proximity, then means the Frenchman beside me: “He, which plugs it together there the heads - is that already again your V4?” and a rather sour expression makes.
Mrs. according to Vicenové the European Union in the future above all hard rules for the budget politics of the member states expect.
As many real, than a “European federation” it regards the concept of Europe of the two or different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the Eurozone and the countries off the Eurozone.
“We have the Schengen area and we to have already Institut of an encouraged co-operation.”
“For the first time said that only the countries are to co-operate, it to want and those, which do not want it, are calmly apart to stand.”
“It will give more and more such institutions, what” runs out, expects” finally on strong “Europe of the different speeds Mrs. Vicenová.
In this regard it appreciated also the role of the Czech republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all topics with effect on the entire European Union by all member states to be discussed must and not only from the countries of the Eurozone.
