Portugal very confidently
The Portuguese crew of Paulo Bento expects to the replay with groβem optimism against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
With the first leg both crews objectivity had been missing.
“In the end these 90 minutes we will be a happy crew and above all a happy country”.
Paulo Bento sees itself already in Poland and Ukraine.
For it gives it not smallest approach of doubts that “La Selecçao” becomes, its soccer national team, for which he has responsibility since September 2010 qualify for the European championship 2012.
For Portugal that means indeed only 90 minutes of beatificness.
But there is Bosnia to play a match to get rid of and an opponent.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that the cubes are not yet fallen.
Portugal dominated the portion over more than one hour clearly, but the crew was not capable of pushing the thing the so important stamp open which would have taken the pressure of it.
“That is a good result, which saves however a certain risk, there we no Auswärtstor obtained”.
At home however, in their brightly lighting up Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, is convinced the Portuguese of to pierce itself before an audience, which might be likewise heiβ on the play, if the portion were even announced naturally as " very scarcely”, said the optimistic, however clear-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very scarce match, are however perfectly convinced the upper hand to win to be able”, explained the 42-year old Portuguese coaches.
“We have further a 50%-ige opportunity with the European championship 2012 thereby to be”, related however the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The standoff on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to obtain and win a gate.
A standoff can be sufficient for the Bosnians, who have likewise a gate necessarily, already.
“That is a good result, which saves however a certain risk, there we no Auswärtstor obtained”, regrets Bento.
“We against a crew to begin, the high technical qualities possesses and had players with many individual qualities”, added it.
As already in Zenica the Portuguese would not intend to already exercise at the beginning maximum pressure on the Bosnians at " them time for thinking admit”.”
A good idea, under the condition that it is put this time into practice.
