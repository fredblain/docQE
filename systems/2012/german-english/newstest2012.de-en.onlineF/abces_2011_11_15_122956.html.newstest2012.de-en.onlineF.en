Athens lets doubts arise again
Papadimos says, which economy measures discharged, but the conservative no written agreement will sign
With risk premiums of the peripheral countries and the driven up broadly making uncertainty continues to get lost Greece also in the labyrinth that from the large European debt crisis leads out.
The impression that the “consent” of the new Greek interim government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of the political forces, slowly by facts occupied.
While the new prime minister, pointed out Lukas Papadimos, yesterday that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that during its appointment arranged for their conversion was too short hundred days possibly, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras insured that he the new economy measures to support and under no circumstances its demand of new elections to the intended date, which 19 February, will take back.
“The most important task of this government is the conversion of the resolutions, which were met on the summit from 26 October”, insured Papadimos yesterday for the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will tomorrow reach its high point with the confidence vote for the new government.
A package with 24 programs for the occupation promotion, for the reform of the disciplinary right for officials and new measures against the tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless Samaras report does not eliminate the doubts about its attitude: “We have ourselves for the support of the interim government obligate, but otherwise to nothing.”
Conservative leaders went step too far with its challenge European Union and IMF, which organism, which must the 8000 million, which needs Athens urgently, unblocking. It got straight that he would not approve an undertaking over the fulfillment of the economy measures.
But the European commission, that is still irritated because of the effects of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, affirmed yesterday again, at its demand was not to be shaken: The economic aid was not signed, if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties would sign “a clear written agreement not as soon as possible”.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika would return “very soon” to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, “which for the payment of the sixth section” at a value of 8000 million euros “necessary is”, although there is still no final date.
The Greek ball has still for one while threads.
