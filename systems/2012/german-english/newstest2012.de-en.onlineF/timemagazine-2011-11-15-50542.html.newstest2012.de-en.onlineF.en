Differently Behring Breivik, which man, who were killed confessed two rampages, with which in this summer in Norway 77 humans, has himself in its first appearance before a public court in Oslo than “resistance " a fighter described.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple knight of Norway”, said he before a court room with more than 500 humans.
“I raise objection against the court, since you received your mandate from organizations, the hate ideologies support and because thereby the multiculturalism is supported.”
“I recognize the laws on, but I do not admit myself guiltily.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, since he did not want to give “Breivik the possibility of using this hearing as a platform on which it its opinions express can.”
For the same reason it refused permission to Breivik, which along-brought a speech written first, for contacting in the end the hearing the members of its victims.
In addition Nesheim did not arrange that the police keeps Breivik for 12 further weeks in custody, it four weeks an entrance to the media has. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence exactly over eight weeks.
