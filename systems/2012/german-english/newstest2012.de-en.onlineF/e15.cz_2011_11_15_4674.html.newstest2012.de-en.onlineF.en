Fire story:
The Innovator IBM steps into the second century of its existence
If one wanted to look for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most exactly, then this would be probably the word “longevity”.
For the broad public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as modern enterprise, although since its establishment already one century elapsed.
The basis to this longevity already put its first boss - who sen visionary Thomas J. Watson.
Already it represented the slogan, countless world-wide problems let itself easily solve, if humans were ready to think a little.
Its slogan “Think!” became in such a way the brand name, over the life of the future giant to take place should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine, which one began to publish at IBM in the year 1935).
This was also the basis of the organisational culture prepared thoroughly by Watsen.
“For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement toward future.
IBM survived and was also a whole century successful, because it remained faithful for its principles and not before back-frightened changing everything else all around.
Permitted us to transform in the course of our first century, the technologies, the Business and also the society.
We hope, which we create, said in the next hundred years still more” Samuel J. Palmisano, the today's director of the enterprise from cause of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson operated already in the thirties social care of its persons employed - in a similar way, like the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacation, an insurance as one the first American persons employed by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a thought-out remuneration system for best newer one and resellers.
Just as thought out is also the long-term relations of IBM with their customers.
The enterprise was from the outset ingenious in the talent promotion - when one of the first companies up and could themselves world-wide main header IBM any Diskrimination accordingly select.
In agreement with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the present plan, which is alternated Palmisan at the point by IBM in the next year by a woman - by Virginia Rometty.
Those participates already thirty years at IBM, so far took it the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and strategy boss.
IBM makes so-called of on-line brainstorming in the last years, from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
No miracle - ideas it gives enough, in the enterprise is busy nearly one half million to humans.
An institution with good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the Business guarantees a strong image and this to the enterprise inward and outward.
“From the outset IBM had rather the concept of an institution, as a bare technology enterprise”, said to Economist the professor of Harvard Business School and the authoress of a book concerning IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology enterprise, but a company, which helps to solve business problems of assistance from technologies”, added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the enterprise stresses, there are a difference to be only present on the market or form it by this presence directly.
IBM - in the states of their logo because of familiar “Big Blue” mentioned, is grown up in one century to one of the largest enterprises of the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology enterprises at all - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation achievements in unbelievable product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology.
From all American technology enterprises IBM possesses the most patents and five its employee with the Nobel Prize was already distinguished.
To its most well-known inventions belong e.g. cash-point dispensers, credit cards, financial WAP, Strichcode or also the floppy disk.
With approx. 220 billion dollar stock exchange value (market capitalisation) was IBM in this year the second largest technology enterprise (right after Apple), whereby it overhauled for the first time since 1996 Microsoft.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers today - unfortunately for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, on-line service Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC was jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, therefore one may bind not emotional to the past”, means themselves in addition Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM does not have a problem to build its foundation walls on different platforms - to leave and if they do not function, it also re.
Contrary to the opponent Microsoft, which stands and falls in principle with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In the profits of IBM take part in largest measure services, software and hardware take part to in each case a fifth.
Still 1990 hardware with one were more than fifty-percent portion most strongly represented.
Since 2000 of 15 billion dollar, in the same time it however 58 billion dollar invested sold IBM little profit throwing off active in the value into the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments IBM continues also after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time like a storm over the world.
IBM the legacy of its first boss remained also here Thomas J. Watson faithfully, who in the middle increased its investment extent in the large world economic crisis.
So far it seems that the enterprise IBM gets over the today's crisis without prejudice to.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 rocket-like by 120 percent and the clear profit of the enterprise grows kontinuell.
The enterprise slogan of IBM reads: everything cannot be changed - only the values.
Also therefore it may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.
IBM history: From the cheese cutter to universe flights
Before one hundred years the society IBM (international Business Machines), created in New York, had at first a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.
She only 1924 took over the name IBM - originally it concerned a trademark for an address into Canada and South America.
The foundation-stone to the later society IBM the fusion of four enterprises put, to their history into the 80's the 19. Century goes back.
They possessed technologies like for example the famous time card clocks for the registration of the beginning of work and - end.
The architect of this new enterprise became Charles Ranlett Flint, which had the presidency in the supervisory board until 1930 also.
And it was Flint, which adjusted the boss of the competition company Thomas J. Watson, so that this helped him with the line of the enterprise.
This Leader placed then even the founders of IBM into the shade - on Watson's ideas was based to today the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise.
Watson led the enterprise until 1952.
IBM, began, like already the name betrays, with the production and the selling of all possible machines for the trade - from Wurst-und cheese cutters, up to cashes.
In the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, it doubled its sales on nine million dollar and the enterprise expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was for the company so indispensably that he sat whole forty years long in the executive chair, he from his son, Thomas Watson junior was only then replaced.
Under its line IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first programming language.
In the 60's technician and computers of IBM helped to lead NASA of flights in the universe - to Mercury and Saturn and in the year 1969 also the famous flight of humans to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed the first computer family with same computer architecture in the year 1964 - the row IBM System/360.
A classical PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came in the year 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Later IBM its computer production sold twenty years to the Chinese society Lenovo, on the other hand one it bought however the consul aunt part of the enterprise PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered hereby completely into the business with consulting achievements and services with high increase in value.
The strategy, IBM in the last three years pays off is the concept “smart planet”.
It embodies the intention of using technologies in intelligent way in so far ranges even not planned e.g. also for the improvement of the situation in traffic and in the city administration.
To the commercial sector IBM introduced recently the platform “smart Commerce”, which was to help the resellers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has also in Czech Republic a strong history.
Already 1932 created IBM an address in Czechoslovakia at that time - as at all the first country in central and Eastern Europe.
Today IBM ČR operates among other things also a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The center for central and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and is here also a Top Forscherteam from world level that with the technology of the voting recognition is concerned.
