MSS announces research minutes for finding the gene for obesity
It institute for social security of Mexico leads a research project for finding the gene for obesity with children and young people, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (institute for social security of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project for the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and young person under the title “genetics of obesity in childhood and youth”, with which the genetic markers in connection with predominance to be found is.
Miguel Cruz López, director/conductor of the Unidad de Investigación Médica EN Bioquímica (department for medical research, emphasis biochemistry) at the hospital hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of physicians, was developed male nurses, nourishing specialists and social workers.
This team supported of specialists and students of the post office graduation course of studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the center de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where each Saturday starting from 8.00 o'clock test with children and young people are accomplished.
It stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the Federal State México) began and is continued since 8 October at the sports field by Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal State México).
If the goal is reached from 500 to 600 investigation persons, the study is continued at the sports field by Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and locked on by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained, the goal of the study was becoming acquainted with the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of factors of risk of Mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative illnesses.
On the occasion of the diabetes he, it explained world-wide tags is aimed at that three thousand children and young person at the age should fill out questionnaires nourish-referred from six to 14 years with agreement and under supervision of their parents.
Also questions are placed to them over their physical activity and their family illness prehistory, in order factors of risk, which could entail diabetes or kidney insufficiency to control.
It implemented the moreover that on Saturdays mentioned the investigation persons were controlled measured (weight, size, waist extent), their blood pressure and blood values were determined like the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification of genes in connection with obesity in the infancy).
Cruz López stressed, this investigation was accomplished on the occasion of the concern of the health personnel over the alarming weight gain of young people.
“The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in scarcely six years the portion of obese boys by 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity had increased by 47 percent. Also the overweightness rose dramatically”, stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated, those search for genetic markers was justified, because the genetic history of the population of Mexico itself of the other peoples of differences.
It indicated that (e) Mexican (in) on the average to 65 percent Indian-more American, to 30 percent more European and to 5 percent of African descent was, which itself in the genes, which with diabetes and predominance in the connection reflects.
Completely generally explained it, the genetics of obesity expresses itself in the inability to burn the surplus of the energy (calories), taken to us, so that this is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained, who would exist direct benefits for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children, with which it was determined whether these exhibited a degree of overweightness or obesity.
It even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and at the interior arm (Akanthosis), which to the probability of metabolic disturbances and diabetes in the preliminary state refer, examined.
All information was confidentially treated and communicated to parents in writing by the physicians. The physicians explain all results of measurement to parents and propose changes of the lifestyle, which are appropriate for the prevention of illnesses.
Cruz López explained, there would be three basic factors, which are responsible for predominance, obesity and other chronic diseases: Lack of movement to go i.e. missing movement in the everyday life to spend most time of the day before the television and use means of transport, in place of short ways to foot.
The high calorie admission, that is, a increased consumption of gezuckerten beverages and carbohydrats (Tamales, bread, pizza, a Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat and protein admission as well as the genetics, which are to be analyzed in this research project.
