Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible cut in the defense nature
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta heated the congress on Monday, when he warned of the fact that automatic budget shortening would weaken national security unnoticed. With it released a financial nuclear chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon up to the theaters in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly-lines.
The Pentagon already thinks shortening out at a value of 450 trillion dollar in the course of the coming decade, is afraid now however that further shortening become more necessary around 600 trillion dollar or, if the congress cannot obtain a conclusion in the expenditures.
“The effects of these shortening would be devastating for the Ministry”, wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said, a failure of the congress in obtaining a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, to 23% general shortening as well as a stop of numerous new projects would lead.
“Such a high shortening, accomplished in such thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and building projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm”, wrote Panetta the senators.
“In addition we would be compelling to separate us involuntarily from a majority of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would so fast be converted, would have we at security of bordering probability civilians to also give time off to be able to reach around the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those, damage those our military upright receive and our alert stand-by seriously.”
The shortening became finally the combat troops to meet”, said Panetta.
“During the wartime contingents in the anti-terror fight by the seizure are not directly concerned, the serious interference into the basic budget the war efforts unfavorably would affect”, warned Panetta.
“Personnel attitudes to be shortened, which to delays in the attitudes and the supervision of attitude, which support the war, would lead.”
“The salaries of the personnel were shortened, which leads to late payments at wartime resellers and who would be legal like also political support disturbed.”
The two senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details concerning the potential influence of the automatic shortening on the Ministry of Defense.
“The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defense would introduce a fast fall of the United States as prominent military power of the world.”
“We are vehement against this Draconian action”, said the senators in a common explanation on Monday afternoon, when they published Panettas letter.
“This is a result, with which we cannot live, and it surely is none that one would thrust us upon should.”
“The seizure is a threat of the national safety interests united and their entering should not be permitted.”
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure to a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exclude the Pentagon from shortening remains awaiting.
Panetta expressed increasingly bluntly the possible shortening, although he could collect many years experiences with the budget in the congress and in the white house, before he came to the point of the Pentagon, and white that he stands in relation to heavy decisions.
At a press conference in the past week the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture, which could be approaching - a military with bowl, but without core.
“It is a ship without sailors.”
“It is a brigade without ammunition.”
“It is a Air Force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots.”
“It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks to fulfill buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers, who are able, the mission”, said Panetta in its opening speech in the Pentagon.
“An armed force, which it lacks moral and alert stand-by and which are not able, is it with potential opponents to be taken up.”
“You leaves one become actually furious.”
In an appendix to its letters at McCain and Graham Panetta stated new details, how creates reductions “significant operational risks: Delays in crisis periods, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions our world-wide employment and of intervention ability, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some the largest defense projects of the cancellation to the victim could fall, including those, which were already tested and in the early planning phase to already be.
To this list belongs also the combat flier F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new suffer-orally Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, which Army and navy need, in order to replace the Humvee.
If one would stop the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollar, but the proponents to say that it is an important next step for armament, so that possible dangers can be avoided by China and other opponents.
