North stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline north stream, which runs on the sea-bottom of the Baltic Sea and which western Europe connects directly with Russia, became in enterprise set.
It is gas for an equivalent of 30 million households to supply with.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with gloss and Gloria.
Over 500 loaded guests, under it four heads of state and government, have last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under orchestra acoustic irradiation and with Feinschmeckerbuffet of the inauguration of the new gas pipeline north stream attended, Russia and Germany under the sea level directly interconnect.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, who Russian president Dmitri Medwedew, which French prime ministers François Fillon as well as its colleague Mark of Rutte from the Netherlands has symbolic-proves together the steering wheel of the valve turned, which carries the Russian gas in the Western European net.
With the new gas pipeline are 27.5 billion cubic meter of additional Russian gas per year by a first piping by 1.224 km length, which connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe to be produced.
Second piping, which a complete delivery of 55 billion cubic meter gas - which equivalent of the French total consumption - permits, is to at the end of 2012 to be finished placed.
And one lets the eventuality of the building of a third line on be reminiscent already to distance.
For Gazprom the punctual and very precise completion of this enormous building works like a victory.
The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic states.
The north stream pipeline will make a direct supply of gas possible to Germany, under avoidance of any route process by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on that overland routes.
For this reason these two countries lose little their power: For it will it now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close the admission to Western European markets.
Warsaw to compare most strongly committedly in the debate, was not shied away from it, the north stream pipeline with “new German as well as tables a pact” in binding to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in the year 1939.
This means that the topic is politically seen äuβerst sensitive.
Western Europe won a still higher supply security by the endorsement of this Russian project.
This however at the expense of an exhaustion of European energy, since the project struck a breach between west and east Europeans.
Russia brought it in hardly five years finished, its vision to a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, which strong gas-uses exhibits and whose gas reserves to the slope go implementing.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, which connects us in organic way”, confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by referring to it, into which degrees the groβen gas contracts from more political and to economic side are important.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers numerously represented in Lubmin regarding the gas inlet.
The building of this gas pipeline is likewise an outstanding technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shroud, which is to protect it against anchors.
It rests on the sea-bottom, in approximately 200 m depth.
With its building had to be avoided to dating mine fields from the Second World War.
“About hundreds mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution”, gave Jens Müller, Sprecher of the society north stream, on.
Auβerdem had to be seized strengthened Maβnahmen for the protection of fauna and flora.
The line is heavy a long queue made of metal, like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is interrupted by nothing over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was intended before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible persons from it distanced oneself, since those were Sweden a little on it eager, to see itself settling a Russian state company in permanent way on height of its coasts.
“In case of an accident we close the gas passage in less than one minute”, specified Jens Müller.
In case of a leakage the gas in the gas pipeline escapes itself thus into air.
This case is only little probably regarded of the technical designers however as, since the Schweiβnähte became estimated on a stability of a leakage per 100,000 year.
The national monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is steered to external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, as well as by equipment, which circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It possesses the form of a cigar, miβt a meter of diameters, the inside the piping is introduced and by the gas pressure moved.
After three complete days of progressive movement by the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the equipment supplies most exact information about possible deformations of the metal with its arrival.
The gas pipeline was conceived, in order to function to fifty years long, without having to be submitted only of the smallest repair.
The gas circulation is ensured completely simply with pressure.
This amounts to 200 bar at the admission, 100 bar at the discharge position.
Five societies united their forces to the implementation of this project.
Wiring remains however in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the portions.
Further here the German societies E are. attached ON and BASF (ever to 15.5%), just as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of firms GDF Suez (ever to 9%).
These five societies formed an enterprise community, which north stream yourself calls and which is assigned the building as well as enterprise of the gas pipeline.
It has its seat in course in Switzerland, where the taxation is particularly favorable.
Gazprom rented then the entire capacity of its gas transport to this society, on verlängerbaren twenty-annual contract.
“Gazprom will pay specified Jens Müller for the overall capacity, no matter how groβ those really transports mass of gas fails”.
The financing of the building of gas pipelines was secured to 30% by shareholders as well as to 70% by bankers' loans.
Entire labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipings.
For GDF Suez the investment sum amounted to for example 240 million.
The minority shareholders are itself however gewiβ to bring their displays in again since Gazprom carries alone the liability risk.
The gas pipeline comes at a sandy coastal line wooded with jaws with Lubmin from the Baltic Sea to light.
The 4.5 meters of high valves form the gas release gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further characteristic numbers of the arriving gas, before this is passed on into the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per applying hour.
With full capacity would be this 3 million cubic meter per hour as well as 6 million in the year 2012.
