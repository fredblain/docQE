Walls have eyes: As researcher you on Facebook observe
Before it became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, differently Behring Breivik was only one of many boys, who would send its anti-immigration opinion on-line.
On Monday Breivik, which confessed with a rampage in Norway in July to have committed had with which 77 humans were killed, its first public hearing before court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is not by far alone in the cyberspace: He spent much time up to his attack before his computer and chatted with some the millions of nationalists, who support right-wing extremist groups on sides of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find more out over these humans.
But how one finds it?
That is easy - one must log in only with Facebook.
“We have determined that it was not heavy, to them to come”, say Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a report of the British think-tank DEMO appeared recently about the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, says to Bartlett that the researchers must use simply the advertizing tools of the side, in order its desired demographic data with scientific accuracy accurately to specify - as it marking out for years do.
Bartletts team turned up one half million fan of right-wing extremist groups in all of Europe and visierte it then with ADDs, but instead of itself with new volume or a new diet product to link, the ADDs invited users to a survey, in whom for its educational background, its attitude in relation to force and the estimate of its own future one asked.
Owing to Facebook Bartlett and its colleagues in the position were to ask more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without them only once would have had to leave their office.
“It is a quite new research method”, says Bartlett.
Some the results hardly surprise. On-line promoters of right-wing extremist groups are usually young, male and are annoyed at immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist “those are, those their on-line activism with an off-line activism combine more reasonably, more democratically and less violent than those, those behind its computer screens to sit remain.”
Demo work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands from scientists.
Think-tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the side, in order to study everything, of health questions up to society trends as in “Likes”, text news and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, who add on the average three contents per day, generate Facebooks “data supernew facts” a research boom, which let the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title rise in the last five years around almost 800%.
For some researchers the beautiful is not reached by Facebook the fact that one can study humans by this side, those one normally with its clipboard on the road.
“If you in former times tried to ask humans of the British national party were very heavy it to identify it.”
“You had to inform first the party and those them never admission would have granted”, say Bartlett.
“With Facebook that is omitted everything - you go directly to them.”
Others say that the side offers a possibility of recognizing and of solving social health problems.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University OF Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues found out that students, who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook are inclined significantly more strongly to the problem drinking than students, who were silent over this topic.
Moreno suggests that of equal standing students, for example apartment adviser, supervise the side and to a student help, if these too many status updates post.
“You cannot solve a problem, if you did not recognize, said it” Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-author and director/conductor of the Child Health, Behavior and development at the Children's Research of institutes in Seattle of Washington Post.
“We did not find a possibility of identifying endangered children those differently found would be.”
In addition Facebook constantly taps the data of its own population.
The data team of the side provided statistics over the relationship status and Valentine's Day, election turnout at the by-elections 2010 and one national to luck index (whereby primarily information was used, on only the Facebook access has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the side should make their large data treasure trove for others accessible research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the side observes them, whether they want now or not. In order with a friend, who is distant for Scrabble from miles thousands, to play to be able, one permits to yield for the side the own personal data.
But which, if the users of Facebook become part of a survey, from which they something do not even know?
While researchers have strictly specified guidelines, as they collect their data off-lines, on-line everything is permitted.
“I do not believe that many users thought at all about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles”, says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge lab, to a study from the year 2006, into he the public sides of students on Facebook examined.
“Which concerns it, went it only around it and her friends.”
Then there is still the question of methodology.
Even off-line does not give it a warranty that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is to be known not possibly, how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
“Which one says on Facebook and which one makes outside from Facebook, two completely different things” are, say Selwyn.
Therefore Selwyn thinks despite its years as a technology researcher that a clipboard and a pin are still the best research tools, which everyone can use.
“There is no replacement to go out into the material world and speak with material humans”, says it.
“Social research must worry about the social - and a lot of social life takes place still off-lines.”
