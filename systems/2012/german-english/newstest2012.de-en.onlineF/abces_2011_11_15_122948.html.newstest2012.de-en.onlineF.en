Japan is again-born after the earthquake
The Gross Domestic Product grows by 1,5% owing to the inland consumption and terminates the spiral of the free case starting from at the beginning of March
Since last March was the Japanese economy paralyzed, itself still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake, which led into an atomic crisis, and which worst the disaster, which is Japan the 2nd world war had experienced.
The first estimations of the government in Tokyo evaluated the damages to property on 300,000 dollar, an impact, which seems to weaken itself despite the difficult world economy situation.
After three quarter of continuing case the information served on the gross domestic product from July to Septembers to finally conclude this chapter: the Gross Domestic Product grew by 1,5% in the comparison to the previous quarter and by 6% to on the year the projected ratio.
The value - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 -, measured in the second quarter, in addition means fastest growth for the period of January until March 2010.
The resurgence can be partly explained by the machine sale for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami.
The enterprises actually increased their investments by 1,1% compared with the decrease by 0,9% for investments, which were registered from January to March, the first decrease after six months of inexorable rises.
Nevertheless the actual reversal of the Japanese economy is based not exclusively from keynsianischen impacts, which use the crisis, in order to develop or build infrastructures again.
Woke up Japan in particular owing to the development of the inland consumption, which constitutes 60% of the Japanese BIPs at present.
This variable rose around 1%, knocked against from the increasing expenditures for vehicles, journeys and leisure activities.
The stigma the yen
Tokyo entrusted itself to the home market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - itself into one of the “refuge currencies” of the investors, who flee before the debt crisis of the Eurozone and the gloomy prognoses for the U.S.A., a privilege, which like a gravestone rests on the accounts of the export enterprises.
With a harder currency the products are abroad more expensive, a serious problem for a country, whose economy is based on the health of the large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony for example attributed their weak business results from July to Septembers to the quotation the yen.
While the markets also further besieges the peripheral European Union-countries, the government Yoshihiko Noda remains watchful.
“One must pay attention to the continuous risks, for example on the degradation of some foreign Ökonomien, the effects of the inundations in Thailand and the fast revaluation the yen”, yesterday the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa meant.
The perspectives are really not much cheering up.
The organization for economic co-operation and development (OECD) explained that most member states would have exhibited clearer signs for a slowing down of the economic development in September.
The indicator, which ahead-takes the turning points of the world economy, brought to the light that with the largest economic powers the brake would have pulled.
Because it sank around four tenths up to loosely 100.4 points compared with the 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone lies even underneath this average value, which is about 100, after she sank around eight tenths on 99,13 points.
