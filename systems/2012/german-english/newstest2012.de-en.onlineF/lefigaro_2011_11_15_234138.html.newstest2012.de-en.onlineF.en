Die Welt gemäβ the republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival to Iraq as well as the assistance for Israel in simplification and unawareness concerning China.
A crisis-weakened America knows a complex world with simple, in order not to say: naive ideas lead?
If one listens to the republican presidential candidate in such a way, the voters could get nearly this impression.
For some days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow combatant let their thundering explanations as well as their statements announce concerning the Auβenpolitik, traditional republican emphasis, repetitive.
Over China, Iran and the Israel assistance - supported frequently in no way - slogans fall.
Mitt Romney standing regarding the appointment of the “Grand old party” most highly in the course threatened the Chinese before the WTO to quote and them the " manipulation of the currency” - prominent topic in an America to accuse that by the drift of entire branches of industry to Asia on the Äuβerste attractive actual.
Stupidly run, if this were to imply an introducing of an economic war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China among Obama and only candidate, which seem to have a matured vision from Auβenpolitik to, pinched itself off almost regarding its emotions flattering of behavior air.
It had called to a strong, but constructional discussion exchange with Peking (likewise the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not answered, since he stagnates in the depths of the public opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had praised likewise military impacts against Iran, if the sanctions should fail for stopping the nuclear program.
“Case I am selected, order I to Iran stop”, he had sounded.
“Obama is re-elected, gets her the bomb”.
Auβerdem has it Israel strengthened military assistance promised and Obama accused this partner in relation to obligations to have remained guilty.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, secondarymost placed candidate, carries for his part an shameful document unawareness to the exhibition.
Recently it called to give the Chinese military threat retort there Peking " tried to develop a nuclear power” - and seemed thereby the fact more auβer eight to leave that China already is since 1964 in the possession of military atomic weapons!
The Texan governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and demands military impacts against Iran, äuβert for his part, to be ready for it the American army in Mexico against drug trusts in service to take.
The resort to Foltermaβnahmen opposite mutmaβlichen terrorists, forbidden by Obama 2009, was likewise endorsed by Cain, Perry as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
One is far to the republican candidate from John McCain, in the year 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
Against the current presidency contractors, Reagan had likewise simple conceptions and won for all that the cold war.
They call in memory that also Obama is in amateur and water had to give into its wine, which concerned the topic anti-terror.
They persist rightfully in the failure of its naive conversation with Iran, the hasty departure of its " boys” from Iraq, to its indetermination in Libya, which likewise brought in the call of the weakness for it.
This meeting with hostility is however not completely so informally.
The population estimates rather the positive balance of national security under Obama, who switched Bin Laden off.
Since Iraq she guards against military interventions, which lead to tiring.
And Obama surprises more appropriately, by arguing, America must economically be rebuilt, in order to arouse its leading position to new life.
