Europe has the democracy invented, now remains, to think the European democracy out
Democracy is a valuable property\; likewise a sensitive property.
The European continent should be able itself to remind of it, who after their invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago entire 20. Century over the tragedies of the First World War, the totalitarianism, the Holocaustes, the Gulag, in addition, Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the highest one in Greece over itself had let be issued.
Some had probably believed, it is sufficient to exercise the right to vote on possible way direktest, in order to see winning the democracy once and for all over its enemies.
One knows since Napoleon " the small one” that it concerned a characteristic of the attitude of mind.
The general right to vote, which represents necessary condition of the democracy, is not for this sufficient condition and can the " suppression instrument” become just as good, as it expressed the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot at that time.
No, democracy requires by far more: a public area, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the force, training, clearing-up, economic and social team spirit, an jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we are, is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all politics and democracy crisis.
The convicition change of the Greek true wrong referendum would have had a doubly informative character in this regard: once that the necessity for a strong return of the policy, on the other side in addition, that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be judged as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight shifted today, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most of them aim, to no more in the correct direction.
We do not have to win anything, over on a success of the domestic referendum to urge, which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in wrong order.
A free pass for the European autocrat or a leap with connected eyes into the emptiness of the nationalistic retreat: A groβartige choice for the citizen!
No, we want heel hatchet, but a collective task, from full right, clarified and constantly, a choice and a democracy, this time on European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know no more im Übrigen already, to terminate where enumerating - there it only one crisis gives, and this prevails in Europe.
It is completely Europe, which bends itself the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and its lack of solidarity.
It is completely Europe, which is humiliated on international level.
One is concerned about sovereignty transfers toward Europe - it is whole Europe, which lose gradually its sovereignty, and thus each particular it attached nations.
The urgency consists of giving to sovereignty of the people the guidance of the European project back to the hand.
Because it is because of the whole been, whether the Europeans reduce the load of their debts, from the markets freely to make themselves and a future by investments to initiate can.
The exit from the crisis has resolutions on European level on the condition, which does not please without total democratic Rechtmäβigkeit become can, without leading us completely surely into spoiling.
After this proposal was over fought against Jacques Delors and the socialist long time, today everyone pushes the European business management in addition.
In agreement.
But itself this without political integration and a stronger democracy - how it is on his mind the citizens - to present, would be a renewed foolishness and a further dead end.
We must take a new stage of European structure on us.
In order to let in France the republic develop, required it the fact, republican “create”.
The revolution of the interests alone could here is not sufficient carries out.
This instruction remains further valid.
We must form Europe integrated better on economical level.
This can be only achieved, by creating politically seen more democratic Europe, a truthfully European sovereignty of the people.
We need Europeans, in order to create Europe.
