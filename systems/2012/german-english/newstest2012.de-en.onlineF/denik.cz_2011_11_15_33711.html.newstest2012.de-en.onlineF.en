Development of the trip prices since 1989
Until 1989 it gave in the ČSSR at that time only five granted national travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold at that time above all only journeys into the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, into the west were allowed at that time only chose.
And in such a way Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the peninsula Crimea at the black sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the black sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, then hit Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the journeys to Yugoslavia was strongly limited.
A large paradox of those socialist times was it that it not even citizen of the Eastern Bloc (thus also the Tschechoslowaken) was permitted to travel in the context of the socialist countries freely.
If a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel for example individually to Poland or to the Soviet Union, then he needed in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual journeys were not possible.
The travel agencies offered also to journeys already at that time into the west, then one must take however enormous queues in purchase or stay overnight also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and/or have at least “good acquaintance” in the travel agency.
The thing had not yet run also in such a way.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was only given to “politically reliable” people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovakian currency was no freely exchangeable currency, without finding foreign exchange promise it would have been thus impossible, the necessary moneys (western currency) for a journey into the west.
Those from far away most Czechs spent from there their vacation inland, no miracle that the Czechs bought innumerable weekend houses and Dat - a habit, which persists until today.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 after the foot.
While until 1989 one vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs spent last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays into countries of the whole world.
An enormous paradox, whose one is today no longer conscious, is the fact that one into at present most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all to travel could not, because it was part Yugoslavia at that time.
Directly of the beginning of the 90's of the past century on the foreign exchange obligation was waived into the neighbouring Western European countries, which caused an enormous wave of short visits particularly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could not get long time of their journeys into the west simply enough, everyone wanted at least a few days there to have been.
Thus the Czech holiday-makers slept with journeys to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have at that time already the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a pension had.
A typical characteristic with journeys abroad of Czechs was at that time more crammed with canneded food, beer and continuous sausage an etc. trunk.
A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists the western currency could buy themselves finally freely.
Our life level and thereby also the average salaries rose, which led into 1997 a further important instant.
Owing to the increased demands for journeys the travel agencies began to prepare journeys after 1997 regularly by charter flights, whereby the air passage reduced in price owing to the possibility of negotiating quantity discounts in the comparison to the past unbelievably.
The Czechs, with exception of the USA, had end of the 90's already foreign exchangeless exchange with all highly developed countries in the world, which made the travel still simpler.
To a further interesting instant in history “post samtenen” passenger traffic came it in the year 2000, when owing to the high demand the first direct charter flight was dispatched into an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since then fly annually direct charter aircrafts with Czech passengers to sunny countries removed far\; in this year one approaches twelve exotic destinations directly from Czech Republic.
To the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually to exotic countries!
A further important instant in the epoch, which marked our “post office-revolutionary” development, came in the year 2008.
On 17 November 2008 main headers the USA the visa obligation for Czech tourists up, whereby our country incorporated itself definitely under the highly developed countries in the world.
In the year the Czechs spent 2008 for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave than 15 Tsd for only one vacation sojourn including the costs at the resort more. CZK per head out.
