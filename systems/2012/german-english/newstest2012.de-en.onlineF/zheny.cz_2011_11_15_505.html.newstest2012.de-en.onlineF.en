But hand on the heart, which woman bears it already to stroll in the search for a well sitting clothing only in such a way by a dress business and try themselves out not directly all (in all possible color combinations) in the cab?
Even if buying for most women is a hobby, for the men it is often pure hell.
Consider they nevertheless times, how often they already said to their man - remain you times rather outside…
Constant discontent
“Am I not too thick?”
“I would have to remove at least five Kilos - was I to begin to jog or make gymnastic?”
“Do I please you at all?”
Them does that come somehow admits forwards?

The stronger sex is itself united - with rising frequency of the complaints the women are ever incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows deseam, tiles and dust wipe, which scrub tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Do you grumble with their partner, because it tramples once again with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, scolding you the children, because the straight scrubbed wash basin is already again dirty and because the glass door at the living room cabinet has already again fingerprints, polishing so much trouble make where nevertheless?

Women are just focused on relations, therefore they pant gladly such topics through, like for example - who, where, with whom, like and why.
Probably everyone of us women has a little harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
