21er house in Vienna
The moved pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian world fair pavilion of Brussels 1958 achieved prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood and decayed.
Now it is reopened as exhibition house.
If by modern post-war architecture one swarms, from clear forms, glass halls, courageous momenta and new building materials, which are typical for the faith in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler world fair is 1958 an appropriate and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion received at that time the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its and floating working steel glass construction.
The building is valid until today as milestone of contemporary architecture.
He announced the architect in such a way that also during the next world fair of Austria pavilion built.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus dish-like Nebenbau in Munich it became finally 1973 internationally famous.
Its pavilion planned as temporary building of exhibitions one had set up, had converted after the world fair in Swiss garden with the Viennese south station and to 1962 therein a museum the 20. Century opens - “20's the house” it was called.
Suitably the building was not however neither spatially and technically as museum - walls for hanging the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless it was so for a long time used, until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building stood and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is called “21er house” and in the future as museum for contemporary art is used now.
Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, there the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every sense.
Implemented the new beginning Agnes Husslein Arco, which became 2007 new directress of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein Arco, attained a doctorate art historian with considerable career among other things in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later with Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and than establishment directress of the museum of the modern trend Salzburg, implemented the change seriously with politicians and monument conservationists, it procured public means and private sponsor funds and specified the use.
Except contemporay art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the foundation of the same name, a café and a book shop should it give, and an office building had to be built in addition.
Supervision, small budget
For execution then Krischanitz was ideal occupation.
Not only, because he had sensitively converted and had extended Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and had won the competition, but because it studied Vienna with Schwanzer at the technical university and the pavilion for it was a “tremendously important place”, at which he had regarded “nearly each weekend” the exhibitions.
It knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost during its transfer to Vienna and his use for new purposes at generosity and ease.
With the current change there were far larger problems: The building was “an energy centrifuge”, says Krischanitz.
The window sections of the glass facade were replaced, glass-fiber reinforced insulation glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cooling bridge steel girders were replaced strengthened or, and asbestos-filled covers were reorganized.
Two basements brought place for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and road provide for the exposure, a bridge lead to the entrance - nearly a new building, but still the light tail he pavilion.
The original outer doors remained, the house are painted in the old red-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema hall is even still completely exactly the same, as it in former times was.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
“Often a material had to be found, which is good and is cheap and also” Krischanitz pleased, says the office for monument protection and refers to a rough ground in the basement.
Despite all obligations, problems and changes the building remained easy flexibly and.
It is difficult been with the pavilion, “from Brussels came along”, Krischanitz recently said, a typical “drop in the town center history”.
So an architecture stands “always at the wrong place” and wants nevertheless “a correct consciousness to arouse”.
In this case the 21er is house however not at the wrong place, because it entered a stroke of luck concerning town construction: Around Swiss garden around develops the straight completely again planned “main station accomodation”, with office and houses.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps still enter: The 21er house could get reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the Sammlerin Francesca of Habsburg bought the citizens of Berlin temporary arts center, and how one hears, she already negotiates with the city around a neighborly location in Swiss garden.
