Military places itself to the increasing pressure to hard reaching through with rape
This week an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are accused of nonintervention with a rape before the military court.
If it should not come to it, hundreds of plaintiffs are available for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11. Week more pregnant, than she was raped at night of a soldier colleague.
It was in October 2008 and it returned straight to her barracks to Miramar north of San Diego of the dinner with a friend, when it met a male colleague, who carried one of 12 pack beer with itself.
He asked it whether he might accompany her on a drink into her room.
“My alarm bells went on”, said Lyman.
But the Texanerin wiped its doubts aside.
I thought: “Oh which, it is 19.
It is from Texas”, said it.
“I wished, I would have heard on my gut feeling.”
Few minutes, after they on Lymans room had gone, the man stepped, pressed behind it her downward and raped her, maintains her.
This week, to 18 November, wait Lyman and 27 other present and earlier military employees fearfully on process with historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, decided in which, whether a complaint, which they raised against the former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, before court becomes certified.
The complaint states that Gates and Rumsfeld did not proceed against the wide-spread rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February von Susan Burke, a woman barrister from Washington, D.C. submitted, covered the complaint at the beginning of 17 plaintiffs, who rose however in the following months to 28: 25 women and three men, who maintain all that they were raped by soldier colleagues or sexual were abused, to condemn and that the military missed it to determine or to place one appropriately jurisdiction after the alleged attacks to the order.,
Burke says, it pursues the highest military guidance, since the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchically developed”, says it.
“Who are the individual persons, who are in the position to exterminate the culture retaliation too? The guidance.”
Burke says in addition that she contacted almost 400 further survivors for February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs as it were into a basket, they become, if necessary, many further complaints to submit, in order to receive the pressure upright.
The team of the defense for the Ministry of Defense, aforementioned of Federal State lawyer Neil MacBride, placed a request, in order to reject complaint.
The documents of the court, which are present Newsweek, would drive in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by present or former soldiers for injuries, to which it in the armed forces came.
Due to a law of the supreme Court from the year 1950, the government is responsible to the so-called Feres doctrines not for injuries, which add themselves in the active service to soldier present.
“The presumed damage developed during the military service of the plaintiffs”, the document means.
The Ministry of Defense refuses each comment to this history.
The things changed for the 1950er years.
If women are not yet to the service in the fight certified, then the distinction only lies in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact attach with native women in the theaters of war.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds of them died in fighting.
It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it does not stand in its fight alone there: three further complaints except their are pending.
To the Yale Law School prepares the Veterans' legally services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of presumed promotion of a misogynic atmosphere.
The non-profit of it independently collect Vietnam of veteran OF America a complaint against the military forwards, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis “personality disorder”, which rape victims received, in order them from the service to dismiss - a usual approach according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action network, a human rights group.
Their group was enough in December complaint against the veteran the administration (dt.: Administration the war veterans), in which she accused it discriminating against practices in their handling performance demands for persons, whom indicated, in the service sexual to have been abused.
Nine laws independently by a mixture from senators and representatives of both parties one submitted to the congress, which offer a set of reference points.
2010 became according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for prevention and message of sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defense of 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.
But most abuses are not at all announced and according to the own estimation the Pentagon consider this number to approx. 13.5 percent estimated 19,000 cases, to which it per year comes.
The report, which was published in March, examines also the prosecution rates: 2010 came 20 percent of the seized cases in the military before court, only half so many as in the civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burkes case describe their attacks as only first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case announced it the presumed rape of the military police less than one hour after the assault.
At this night, then it says, it was 11 times asked, the details of their rape of a whole set of policemen to tell physicians and commanders.
It had a rape set and the blood of their aggressor, which originated from a cut at its arm, in its bed was found.
Six months later, in April 2009, one belonged to Lyman of a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex, which she had before the encroachment with her friend.
Six persons stated as character witnesses in the name of the presumed perpetrator, who was finally acquitted.
“I remember still well the day, as which judgment was read out”, says Lyman.
“I thought, which would use a blowing. I ran crying from the court room.”
“You brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember that I, when I came out again said to my commander: That was not its procedure. That was my procedure.”
Lyman was requested to visit a military psychiatrist who diagnosed finally a personality disorder and her for unfit for duty explained.
In January 2010 it became dishonorably to dismiss, so that she does not receive any support.
Whether the complaint, which Lyman and the other plaintiffs submitted advances, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, then he marks: “In my opinion they should advance.”
Which stands between them and a pronouncement of judgment, are this doctrines, which are criticized, since it was questioned for the first time.
I am lifelong a critic of the Feres doctrines.
The military limps one decade afterwards, because they do not possess the same incentive and the same deterrence, which bring a liability with itself.
It adds: “The opportunities stand against it… however it are important for it that they try it.”
These things will change only if good humans are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, becomes Burke, which woman barrister of the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases to begin.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard, come to it to reforms”, say them.
Or to we die, whatever enters as the first.
