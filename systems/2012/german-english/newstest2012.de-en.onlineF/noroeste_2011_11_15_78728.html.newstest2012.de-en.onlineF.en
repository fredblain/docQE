The court approves the transition to the digital television to Mexico for 2015
The conversion of the similar to digital signals belongs in the last years world-wide to the most important changes.
The highest Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) pointed the constitutional challenges, which from the senate and the Lower House against presidential-let were submitted, and strength that the change-over of similar on digital signals from 2021 on 2015 to be brought forward must, due to missing eight voices, which are necessary for the law contestation, back.
A minority of four Ministers, under it also the president of the highest Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, was the opinion, which president Felipe Calderón did not have his competencies exceeded, when he published the law decree with the details over the change-over on the terrestrial digital television.
With this resolution the condition controversy called by the senate in the life was rejected, since it did not receive the necessary qualified majority from eight voices, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or the non--constitutionality. Thus the law remains.
In the project for the complaint, which was prepared by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, was suggested, explaining the law decree for unconstitutional since for the radio and the television adjustments concerned the Comisión federal one de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (federal commission for telecommunications in Mexico) it is responsible why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the legal reservations.
In favor of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero were correct.
With this argument both the senate and the chamber of deputies submitted constitutional complaints against the law decree. After acceptance of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero would not use the law decree and stopped all activities for the facility of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected also the complaint submitted by the chamber of deputies, without entering thereby into the debate over the project, for which the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible likewise.
In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the land government may not adjust the measures, which the public administration is to seize with general regulations.
“I do not believe also that, if one would do that, which was impaired independence of the adjustment place”. It reminded also of the fact that for the planning of strategic politics policies, as for example the sector of telecommunications, from constitutional reasons the centralnational government is responsible, because this leads the state affairs.
The replacement of the similar signals by digital is one of the most important changes, which took place in the last years in the whole world, and she causes a better use of the radio-electrical spectrum, a increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the conversion, meant it, is postponing the usufruct of the digitization, which was a decision in the public interest, which does not only have technical criteria, “it covers economic, social, political and aspects in terms of safety.”
These affairs, it stressed, “made an acting of the entire system necessary, in accordance with the principle of the economic line by the state contained it a group of characteristics, those the condition into the hands of the centralnational government puts.”
She called in the memory that many countries would have already accomplished world-wide the digital conversion, over the government, although they ordered over highly specialized facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree intervenes in the authority of the congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation were kept”, insured them.
