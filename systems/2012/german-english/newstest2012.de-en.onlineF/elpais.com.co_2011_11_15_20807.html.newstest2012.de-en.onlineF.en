What was missing to the candidate del Valle, in order the new measures Colombia to be?
Analysis of the factors, which affected that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown measure Colombia did not get.
El Valle receives to its 14. Measurement title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went empty with the assignment of the crown for measures Colombia.
This mark had to give itself Melina Ramírez Serna contently to stand on the winner podium to place a silver crown and the volume, which it as new measure Colombia proves, to the exhibition.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where measure Atlántico the crown and the cedar actually took, comes the Departamento already on 14 measurement titles and Melina associates with the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had held the crown almost in the hands. To the proclaimed Misses belong: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The large question, which today many ask themselves, reads: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the fall large favorite, which had shown with each demonstration that her over all ordered, to be in order the new measures Colombia. She had been selected not in vain to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles, which had received also the beauty queens valley IANA Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which the crown measure Colombia with home took.
The first factor, that as crucial is valid for the resolution of the jury, it to first measures to appoint, is that it has the answer to the question “which book you most strongly affected and why? ”, which by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had been placed to it, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered to the interrogator:
“I read much, I believe quite in the literature, I believe, it am a kind to be civilized, in the long run believe myself I that the book, which coined for my childhood most strongly is “a small prince”, a quite deeply going book.
At present I read “debt and atonement”. It is a book of the universal culture, which we all should read. I read a straight book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book, ` the Leidenschaften'heißt.
An answer, which encountered little approval, first of all because of the term ` zivilisieren'und secondly, because she had not explained concretely, in which way of everyone of it book specified it had affected itself.
But after conclusion of the ceremony Melina explained to feel calmly and happy with the result: “The universe is points, it happens, what must happen.
And for all people: Read please a little “the small prince”. It is a great book.
Among other things it is said that the favorite of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the preferential one, collected the all Beifälle and before all prices had gotten (catering trade competition Easter, audience vote over best hand-tailored costume and Reina the Madre), “the other candidates had made jealous, what the queen stressed, therefore on the stage could not shine.”
And one noticed with its first conception in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton hotel and with her two elevators with the coronation celebration.
Although it arose with both reliably, you were missing nevertheless the strength and the momentum, which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program “Como EN casa” with the channel RCN meant that the fact that Melina to measure one crowned, shows “that the candidate, who wins most prices during the competition becomes finally nevertheless not queen”.
In addition Valle went in the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie concerning its interest in the social work, what in the long run the substantial of the national beauty competition is.
It will already have its reason that Lucy Doughty explained two days before the composition of the international jury, it looked for a woman, who engaged herself for the social affairs of its country.
“Beauty alone is enough for one does not measure Colombia not. One must look over the physical and concentrate on social feeling, on it that she had already cooperated, explained before the participation in the competition in projects” her.
One also speculates that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which one marked to it in the gastric region had transgressed. But that is contradictory, because the jury selected her as a candidate for “natural beauty” with a healthy body, good nourishing habits and a responsible manual labor.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that however Melina did not have the best body that it improved would give, “its problem with the Fibrose at the belly, which was honestly said hardly to be noticed for me pressed their score on the last day.”
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos of the opinion is, the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgical interferences, to which she had undergone, was.
“The operations are ok, but Valle did not know, how she should let her make correct.
Their body was never their strong side, and it had to pay this place.”
Because of this price, which is assigned the first time by the national beauty competition, a cruel forecast after the appearance in the bathing suit, which should become true at the night, developed. It was gossiped secretly that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price, in order not to let it come into the benefit of the crown.
No matter whether tunes or is not, fact that Melina from today on its rule year start, not as a queen, but when princess to represent a position, which offers it the possibility, on appointment of the national beauty competition Colombia with one of the international competitions.
However it will enter as one of the queens, which despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped, history.
