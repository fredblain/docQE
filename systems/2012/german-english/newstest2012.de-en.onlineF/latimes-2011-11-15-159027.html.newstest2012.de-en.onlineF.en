Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws, when court accepts case
On the day, in which the supreme Court behind locked doors participated met, in order to discuss the politically dividing question, whether one will listen to a contestation of the health laws of president Obama, two its judge, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, in a Dinner, which was gesponsort by the chancellery that will represent the case before court.
The incident took place past Thursday, when all nine judges met to a meeting, in order over the petitions for examination to advise.
One of the too treated cases was a complaint, which 26 states raised against the extensive reform of the health service, which past year by the congress were decided, a law, which became with the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the key word.
The judges agreed the hearing. Actually in March 5 1/2-hour basic discussion expected, which will probably set their result probably the presidency fight in motion 2012, will be that at the time, on which the judicial ruling is announced, in the full course.
The lawyer, who stands before court and that the law is to be tilted, probably Paul Clement will maintain will be, once prosecutor general under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements chancellery, Bancroft PLLC, was one that nearly two dozen of enterprises, which supported the annual Dinner of the Föderalisti society, an old-established group, which dedicates itself to the defense of conservative right principles.
Another enterprise, which sponsorte the Dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, national the Federation OF Independent Businesses, which contest the law.
A further sponsor was the pharmacy giant Pfizer Inc., which is enormously involved financially in the result of the process.
The Dinner took place few hours, after the court had advised over the case, in one Washington hotel.
Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the party head of the republicans in the senate and an explained opponent of the health reform
The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
That is not anything new: The two judges visit meetings of the Föderalisti society for years.
And does not offend against moral rules.
Indeed judge of the code of conduct frees itself, which regulates the actions of the low Federal High Court Judges.
If they would be it, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which means the following: “A judge can participate in Benefizveranstaltungen of law details and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a spokesman, honor guest or according to program no guest such meetings.”
Nevertheless the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas were sufficient to two of the chancelleries standing with the case in connection as well as to an enterprise with a substantial financial interest in this, in order to alarm Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten.
“This astonishing break with moral and the contrast to the code lie, the court punishes the complaints of some judges adheres to the same rules, which are valid for Bob Edgar, Präsident of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA for all other Federal High Court Judges”, said.
“The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with attorneys with floating procedures at the court.”
Their occurrence and their support of a fund-raising campaign for this meeting undermine any requirement on impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics, who say, it affair of court too easily with groups, which are guided by the agenda, like for example the Föderalisti society, would mix.
And the Thomas' wife Ginni is well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand it states the conservative that it is not a judge Elena Kagan, which has a moral problem Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was prosecutor general under the Obama government, when the first law contestations came in first instance before court.
Their critics pushed Kagan to withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of prepossession since them were too much in the defense of the law committed, in order to be impartial.
Kagan does not make institutes to do this.
