The bill of fare of an fat-addicted child: It has breakfast not and eats to evening bread sausage
More than one third of the children from 9 to 13 have problems with predominance, whereby 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current surveys proved - adipöse children mostly originate from families with unhealthy lifestyle.
Thus is it shown once again, how important for the healthy development of humans the environment is, in which it grows up and who are examples, which surround it.
On the tables of adipöser children sausage goods up to the half stand more frequently on the table, than in families, in which normalweighty children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children the day before the clearing-up action under the slogan “adiposity is no coincidence” French fries had to evening bread.
In families with Dickerchen also sport does not rank straight among the favorite occupations, which concerns however also the majority today's pupils - only 15 percent answered that their parents few are once in the week time for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place past year toward end of the school year, almost 900 children from primary schools in completely Czech Republic were asked.
That was not already the second class of the action “adiposity is coincidence”, which is supported by the general health insurance company and the society Unilever.
So far more than 12 thousand pupils participated out 4th and 8th classes in the project.
Unhealthy food and missing movement in the family are thereby crucial factors, which are responsible for those alarmingly rising number of children with predominance or even obesisty.
“Only half of the asked children stated for example, five times on the day to eat in the mode breakfast second breakfast lunch Vesper Abendbrot - one of the main conditions for a healthy nutrition”, then one of the survey data reads.
No breakfast and sausage to evening bread
Experts refer to the fact that also relative little things, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, for the healthy development of a child is important.
In Czech Republic have breakfast however only 23 percent of the families of the pupils.
And - in most families everyone has breakfast for itself alone.
The statement, which in each tenth family at all one does not have breakfast, was worst.
The breakfast is considered thereby as foundation-stone of the healthy daily nutrition.
The survey test brought among other things to the day that one consumes much more frequently unhealthy French fries in the families of overweight children.
And nearly everyone - without consideration for the weight - drinks each day sweet lemonades (70 percent)
Drive more than 40 percent of the asked children sport, but do only less than half of their parents - the only 15 percent.
Arrange you your own menu
A further part of the survey made it for selected children possible (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), to arrange itself from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion their own menu.
“Which Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition, are far from the ideal of a healthy nutrition.
Under their favorite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and naturally sweet foods.
“Above all the large popularity of sweet lemonades” is alarming, in the final report to this survey is stressed.
With the lunch, thus to the main course, pasta triumphed scarcely before poultry.
Leguminous plants did not like the children nearly and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as the lunch were very small.
Limp-honor to the health
At the same time the survey showed in addition, that the children are quite ready to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
“With the control group of the survey-taken part, which is not the questionnaires after conclusion of the clearing up lecture “adiposity coincidence” filled out, a clear shift of the preferences was to principles of the healthy nutrition to register”, is aforementioned in the results of the project in many cases.
Obvious this was for example with the sweet Limos, where many children began to give to usual water the priority.
The children marked in the questionnaire poultry or fish with a cross than main course of the day also much more frequently and were ready, less dumpling or sweet meals to be eaten.
