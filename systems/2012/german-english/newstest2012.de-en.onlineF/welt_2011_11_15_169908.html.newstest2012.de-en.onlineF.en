Warren Buffett enters with 10 billion at IBM
Financial guru buffet invests strongly in the IT-enterprise IBM.
For March it bought up shares in the value of more than ten billion dollar.
So far the large American investor had always explained Warren Buffett not to invest in IT and computer enterprises since the long-term development of the companies can be prognosticated only badly.
Now he read however the business reports of IBM and changed its opinion over investments in the industry.
He had to understand already much in former times the fact that IBM offers above all services and for the IT-departments of other enterprises procures computer systems.
An investment of Warren Buffett is considered as knight impact in the financial world.
Therefore may the IT-bedrock IBM now “sir IBM” call itself.
Because buffet revealed now in the U.S. economy transmitter CNBC that it had bought since March IBM shares in the value of 10.7 billion dollar.
Its investment holding Berkshire Hathaway is ascended thereby to one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a portion of 5,5 percent.
Buffet said that IBM had not even known so far something from the commitment.
It praised the management, which had provided even in the economic crisis still for tidy profits.
“You made, said a great job” buffet to the strategy.
IBM sets for quite some time on the lucrative IT-services like the enterprise of datacenters.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer offers also software and consultation on as well as high performance firm computers.
Buffet had to date rather avoided technology companies.
He says, he invests only in enterprises, whose business he also understands.
Instead accessed buffet for instance on a freight railway, with a lubricant manufacturer or machine-builders.
Its holding Berkshire Hathaway possesses portions of a whole set of large concerns beside approximately 80 own subsidiaries also such as Coca-Cola or the Munich RH, the earlier Munich.
The 81-year old had transferred the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway to the 1960er-Jahren and had developed it with intelligent investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world.
Its lifestyle is modest nevertheless.
It is therefore for innumerable investors in all world a cult figure.
Its nearly unfailing sense for the money making brought in the nickname “oracle of Omaha” for it.
After becoming known the buffet investment the IBM share rose in the free market around a percent.
“Big Blue”, how IBM is also called, is at the stock exchange altogether more than 220 billion dollar worth and ranks thereby together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology enterprises of the world.
At Microsoft, then buffet said, does not want not to enter it however.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
