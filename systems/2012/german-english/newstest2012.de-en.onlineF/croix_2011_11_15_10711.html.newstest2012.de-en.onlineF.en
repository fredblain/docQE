Why does the unemployment ratio of handicapped employed persons on so high level remain?
19% of the handicapped persons are approximate on search for a job.
Today begins the " 15. Week of the work for handicapped ones”.
Despite determined public politics, which were introduced in the year 2005, the unemployment ratio is always twice as high with handicapped persons like the average average value: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Discouraging?
“No, then Éric Blanchet, general manager of the combination Adapt stresses, those “the week of the work for handicapped ones” aligns.”
“Within fifteen years the obtained progress is considerable.”
“At that time the unemployment ratio was not double, but three-way so high.”
“Nevertheless still enormously much remains doing.”
It must be said however that for handicapped unemployed persons further numerous obstacles continue, before they get a job.
More frequently it meets the older ones: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on the average).
They have a small qualification level: 80% of them have no Abitur and it to find only 10,000 obstructed themselves under the 2.3 million student with higher education conclusion.
Finally also long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% with the handicapped ones opposite 38% in the total cut.
In short there are so many criteria, which make a renewed work entrance more difficult, and which the “core of the problem educate”, so Christian Grapin, general manager von Tremplin to enlist 1992 a created combination, which is helpful to enterprises in it, handicapped employed person.
So much to the material brakes.
That remains unexpressed one, which attitudes of mind, which develop further certainly, but nevertheless slowly.
In April a study accomplished by the combination IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité indicated, the asked managers has “a weak knowledge level concerning obstructions”, is “over-represented” “from persons in wheelchairs, psychologically or intellectually to min-crude-averaged”.
Result is that those have private business with more than 20 employees still another far way before itself, in order the employment goal of 6% obstructed employed person, which was fixed in a law of 1987, to be obtained.
These latter, from the year 2008 coming numbers refer to a quotient of 2,6%.
“We are now with over the 3%”, report Pierre Blanc, general manager von Agefiph, the organization, which is assigned to drive contributions of enterprises which ignore this law.
The proof: The number of " fees more paying” business premises was reduced just like the sum of the deposited amounts between 2007 and 2011, zahlenmäβig from 59.000 to 46.000 (and of 606 to 480 million euros).
“The law of 2005, which plans contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the enterprises, explained Pierre Blanc.”
“However this improvement expresses likewise a genuine realization in particular with the groβen groups of firms.”
According to the Ministry for work only 59% of business premises between 20 and 49 employees obstructed employed person, enterprise employ with 100 to 199 employees against it 82%.
