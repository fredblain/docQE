Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, such a braintrust
The Canadians live in refusal of death, as comes out from a report of the royal society of Canada
The committee explained that governments, institutions of hygiene and physicians co-operated regarding schmerzlindernder treatment around the best schmerzlindernden means ready to place, and this also going beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude in relation to death.
Only 9% the Canadian admit themselves actually to speak with their physician about conditions die under those them would like and to meet arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the royal society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, who are on different fields of activity, among other things ethics, right and medicine, with one another linked.
This committee recommends to the government to amend the penal law in such a manner in order accompanied suicide and euthanasia to permit, where this choice places itself, with patients, whom as in the situation is regarded, such a decision to meet.
As prelude the experts quote a recently published survey of the independent society EIU, which had with one another compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada placed itself here on 10th rank, the study that “the medical dying support brought a culture out in Canada, notices in which humans fear has, the topic death to begin to cut”.
Medical support or not: 77% the Canadian do not have an entrance to pain killing means, then report to us the experts ordered by the royal society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home then however finally 68.6% of these die in the hospital.
Regarded from the entire country the rate with 86% is on in the hospital entered deaths in the Quebec highest.
In the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide come the authors of the report to conclusions, those the position of the federal government, that already geäuβert to want to make no changes of the penal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide are against-directed.
Now however it gives according to the experts, who gleichermaβen all those countries examined, whose approach euthanasia and it accompanied suicide legalized or decriminalized no proof that such a decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, thus practice execution by euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would lead to.
On the contrary one meets substantially more cases of such infringements straight in the countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicides are not legalized, like yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a teleconference confirmed.
To “in Canada, where she is clearly illegal it is practiced euthanasia.”
“One practices suicides also accompanied in Canada, although here clearly illegaly”, Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians endorse the euthanasia
We realize that according to in the year 2010 an accomplished Angus Reid survey 85% the Canadian had already geäuβert themselves in favor of the euthanasia, since they the opinion are these permit it persons in the end their journey through life to moderate their suffering.
And 66% believe that circumstances of a legalization of the euthanasia do not have as a consequence to obtain the message that the life of older or handicapped humans less value besäβe.
Regarding the persons, who already practiced to accompanied suicide, the asked ones hold the opinion to 41% that these should not be criminally pursued.
Which or attitude of the means concerns maintenance with patients, situation presents itself so the authors of the report as less clear.
Likewise these put in their recommendation listing close that in the penal law it is not to be indicated that setting the means off, for which a legal refusal was present when criminally is to be valid.
The braintrust demands beyond that specialists of the health service in the task should be trained to respect a setting of the means off at the end of life and this without criminal pursuit to be afraid to have.
The committee explained that governments, institutions of hygiene and physicians co-operated regarding schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to place the best schmerzlindernden means ready and this also going beyond the cases of cancer.
The committee last demands regarding the means extensively used already in the Canadian institutions to hygiene to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to consider these at least since these just as few served as the euthanasia for it, physical pain to reduce and these to the same procedures would refer.
Reserves other experts
Some experts on the area of law of the health service already stated reservations regarding the conclusions of the expert report of the royal society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, called the attitude of the report-signing experts among other things " extremely”, since this does not set with patients in the final phase any limits to euthanasia practice.
“This opens the gates for a situation, in which everyone, which is world-weary and older than 18 years, another person to ask, it helpful in its suicide to be”, so RA Deschamps, which had examined a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps stressed likewise, the authors of the report seemed to place the sole responsibility of the particular over all other values, which are involved in the social Gewirke of the society.
Now however, then he says, would give it " guidelines and obligations in a society”.
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, likewise expressed " a strong resistance” in relation to the conclusions of the report, which she dubbed as " pro euthanasia manifest”.
Margaret Somerville, which is even member of the royal society of Canada, doubts in particular the information of report concerning the Nichtvorliegens of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicides are legalized, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
