Troops feel rather compassion as respect
The event was an embankment a Street gala, which collected millions of dollar for homeless veterans in New York town center.
Kid Rock sang a ballad over helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword collected themselves hundred soldiers, sailor, pilot and marine around it.
The quantity in black tuxedoes rose and applauded.
“The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes”, said David Saltzman, which organized the fund-raising campaign in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the gala, which among other things by the staff boss and chairman at that time, admiral Mike gauzes was observed, saw the role of the troops differently.
“You were introduced like orphans”, wrote the officer in an email.
I am safe me, the organizers it well meant.
I know that.
But it was not respect, really not. It was compassion.
The glaring contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the usually dissociated, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are over-accumulated with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, says service member.
The public behaves increasingly, as if you would do humans in uniform suffering.
“We were not by any means victims”, said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who will go to troops in Iraq commanded and soon to Afghanistan.
“The only way of the support that is however apparent is to press us into the role of unfortunate souls.”
The topic is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungratefully or in the controversy with the public, which they serve.
Also they recognized that the rage, which struck returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War against was by far worse.
As consequence discussions over compassion take place secretly and private ones between war veterans.
After its two sons returned from fights with that marine, the Colonel warned a.D. Mark of Cancian it before the fact that humans could see their service from two different perspectives outside of the military world.
Some they would regard with a feeling of reverence, since they had traveled rebels defeated and to exotic places.
Others would ask themselves, whether a “furious, violent veteran under the surface” hides itself, said Cancian, which had fought in Iraq and after its return an elevated state post to Washington transferred.
While, then he said, felt to its search for employment he that some the Befrager subtly it inquired whether he was able to withstand right after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
“If it about your service speak, must you the negative impressions counter”, explained Cancian its sons.
The missing ease of the military is rooted partially in the missing interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battleground are picked out only rarely from a country that little experience with the military has and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan sees, as praise.
“We as a nation estimate military heroism no longer in such a way, like it still in the Second World War were absolutely usual”, said second lieutenant general David Barno a.D., that US-troops in Afghanistan commanded.
Instead the praise of the politicians and the public concentrates to a large extent on the suffering of a service member.
Troops find acknowledgment for the number of attacks, which bore them, the number of friends, them lost or for the weight of their injuries.
