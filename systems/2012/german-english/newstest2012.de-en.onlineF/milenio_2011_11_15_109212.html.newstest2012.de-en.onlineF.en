The designate prime ministers, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow with the president of Italy, in order to present to this the new government, that is to offer the forehead to the crisis, which led Italy to the edge of the economic collapse.
A report from the presidency palace announced that on Sunday the appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of a government.
One assumes it will present a cabinet by the majority built up from technocrats, although is not yet clear, when the new Prime Minister will begin his office.
Monti said, it to the president the results of the discussions with the political parties to the formation of a government would present.
“I would like my absolute confidence into the ability of our country to become finished affirm by these difficult times”, said the former European Union-commissioner to the journalists.
Monti confirmed not expressly the formation of a government, but from its comments it comes out that the obstacles are overcome.
The “framework is now well marked out”, added it.
Monti created it less in as three days to educate a government that is much less time than normal. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis, which drove the costs of the debts into an intolerable height.
The new, from which Monti led government must discharge former European Union-commissioner a hard savings package, which was demanded by the euro politicians, in order to recover the fastened confidence in Italy.
The pressure to the hurry, which on Monti rests, still strengthened by the varying market situation, due to which the Italian government loans were loaded for 10 years with 7 percent of interest. That corresponds to the conditions, with which Greece and Ireland saw themselves in a forced manner to request the European emergency parachute.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian trade association Confindustria divided the press after a meeting with Monti with: “We said we this government after all forces would support.”
We believe that this government is the last opportunity, so that Italy from this emergency situation comes out.
The chances of success Montis were increased by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to withdraw on Saturday due to the crisis, substantially.
“We believe to cause that the efforts of professor Monti are intended for it, good results”, said Angelino Alfano, Sekretär of the center right-wing party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is substantial, because up to now many of their members expressed themselves existing government, that forms Monti straight, against one by the majority from technocrats.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures.
Resistance against its efforts or delaying the reforms could cause a devastating attack of the financial markets again.
The Italian federation of foreign banks practices with its reference, a failure Montis is a disaster, likewise pressure out.
Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, trade unions and trade associations as well as with youth and woman organizations.
Tuesday evening should be final the meeting round.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, which set an extremely fast change of government as answer to the crisis on.
After short drawing a deep breath toward end of the last week, to be familiar that Berlusconi would withdraw it was reached, to have due to the uncertainty by means of the success of the new Prime Minister the costs of the Italian government loans again critical borders.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt at a value of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the present European Union-emergency parachute.
Monti said, its government it had up to the next elections, which are presumably held in the year 2013, lasts, despite the forecasts that the politicians will give him only time for the conversion of the reforms to prefer in place of the elections.
Monti expressed, it gladly politicians to its cabinet would accept, but it insists the large parties on it that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their doubts in view of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and the dividednesses between the portions make the inclusion complicated by persons from the political life.
