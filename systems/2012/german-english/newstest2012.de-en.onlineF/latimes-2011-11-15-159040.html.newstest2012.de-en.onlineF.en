Boeing draws order for record of to 18 trillion dollar ashore
Airline of emirates orders 50 two-usual airplanes of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 further airplanes.
In addition Boeing sells six Boeing Dreamliner at Oman Air, a business in the value of to more than 1 trillion dollar.
It is really a rare message that an enterprise gets an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a large business, if the enterprise of the aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes altogether with a record sum of 18 trillion dollar lies.
The client of Boeing is just as unusual: the middle east, an increasing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a prognosis, which was published on Monday, the Chicagoer estimates enterprises that airlines from the middle east in the coming 20 years 2,520 airplanes in the value of 450 trillion dollar needs.
Boeing announced on the weekend its largest order of all times for commercial airplanes, based on the value of the order: 50 two-usual Boeing 777 jets.
The order for hammer came from the airline of emirate from Dubai.
In addition the airline has, then Boeing announced it to 2011 on the Dubai Air Show, an option on the purchase of 20 further airplanes, which the entire list price to 26 trillion dollar lets rise.
On Monday ordered then according to Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves the fuel consumption and the comfort of the passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these airplanes is with more than 1 trillion dollar.
“That is absolutely positive for Boeing”, said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist of Morningstar.
“The quality of these special customers is very high.”
Many airlines of the middle east are in the possession that oil of producing countries.
Thus they do not only have the money, in order to pay the airplanes. Rather is a rise of the oil prices, which usually harms the airlines, since this is one of their largest matters of expense, not so harmful, since the country at a higher oil price earns.
That is important, since they tend less than other airlines to cancellation or shift airplane orders, if the oil prices rise, said to Dihora.
“You have a natural security”, said it.
The order of emirate affirms of Boeing leading position on the market for large-capacity aircraft and helps to hold the airbus competitor SAS in chess which attacks the supremacy with the A350.
Of Boeing victory on the Air Show comes four months after airbus announced, one the introduction of the largest A350 would shift, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction, in order to win more confidence, after the customers had demanded a higher payload and range.
The Boeing shares rose around 1,5% to $ 67,94.
