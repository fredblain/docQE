Deutsche Bank lets raw material business analyze
By Christian Teevs
Do Deutsche Bank give their business up with agrarian raw materials?
After mirror on-line information Josef Ackermann assigned a working group to check the consequences of the speculation for the arms of the world.
In January the company head wants to then pull to consequences.
Hamburg -
For the Federal citizens the thing is clear: It does not find 84 percent of the Germans acceptable it according to a study that banks speculate in agrarian raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the asked ones demand that Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions step out of this business, because it intensifies the problems of the poorest ones of the world.
That is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf the consumer association Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, which Foodwatch in the middle of presented Octobers.
In it the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets at the global raw material stock exchanges drive the prices up - and the banks therefore a partial responsibility at the world-wide hunger problem carry.
The campaign of consumer protections is directed concretely against German bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks act such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley similarly.
Originally raw material bets were meant for securing resellers against price fluctuations.
But meanwhile are itself most experts united that the gamblers decoupled themselves of supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits to make.
Differently than the US competitors Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He did not promise, which said reproaches to check and, business is worth it “to risk the good reputation of the German bank”.
After information from Spiegel online an international working group checks at present the reproaches from the Foodwatch report.
Until end of the year is to be concluded the examination, then the results the executive committee of the German bank presented - including recommendation, how is to be gone around with it.
At the end of January wants the point of the bank to then communicate, it draws which conclusions.
In the end a reduction of the raw material business, or even the complete break could stand.
Ackermann tinkers at its image
Foodwatch boss of Thilo Bode welcomed the message, affirmed however at the same time its criticism at the financial sector: “The bets on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically, like inconsiderately banks today the common weal damage.”
Ackermann now particularly stands as the highest bank lobbyist in the obligation.
“Must Deutsche Bank all plants from its portfolio paint, with which money is used for bets on food prices”, said Bode.
“No matter whether it concerns to Mr. Ackermann hunger suffering humans or the call of the German bank.”
The insight of Ackermann comes at first sight surprisingly, clearly is however that the company head would like to deliver few months before its outlet from the office a perfect picture.
On Monday Deutsche Bank announced that the chief executive will planned not change differently than into the supervisory board.
With a break with the disputed agrarian speculation it could improve its image.
And in order possible losses needs it to hardly bother - thus its successor would have to finally do.
Each second would quit raw material plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure high the manager.
So far already more than 30,000 internet users participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which Institut Forsa on 7 and 8 November asked 1001 humans.
Just eleven percent therefore regard it for legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers plants, with which prices as food are bet.
Many banking customers would draw also personal conclusions, if they experience that their bank takes part in such business: Each second would quit all plants, with which money flows into the raw material speculation according to the survey.
Acquaintance would advise 43 percent against such a bank to quit and change to another Institut 49 percent indicated to think about it their account.
