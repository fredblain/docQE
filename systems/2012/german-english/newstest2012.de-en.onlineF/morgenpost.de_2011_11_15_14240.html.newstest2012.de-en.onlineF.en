Intelligent crows spread in cities
In many places seed crows are considered as “problem birds”: But from the cities the high-intelligent animals do not let themselves be driven out for a long time any longer, maintain experts.
, like the one they, which would like to get rid others them completely fast: Crows belong for centuries to the townscape, but in many municipalities adjacent resident complaints over dirt and noise of the animals accumulate themselves.
A means is so far not against the “problem birds” in view.
Seed crows are not from the cities any longer out to gotten, said experts with the first crow symposium in the East Frisian empty.
There specialists from the entire federal territory advised over possible ways out.
They look for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed thereby the problems in cities also to the migration from the land of the particularly protected seed crows: The chemistry employment in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional habitats.
And the cases of typical breeding trees the life made the hunt, increasing land development heavy for the birds.
Crows stand under nature conservation.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding's pairs among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim with Bremen as well as in empty.
There 2005 a disputed project had provided for the massive killing of crows in the district for negative headlines.
Critics had called a catching of the animals in bird traps and killing with clubs particularly brutal.
“Normal expulsion, the Vergrämen, does not bring anything”, the city and landscape designer to Werner Klöver from empty determined.
Nests with water away-squirt or trees fell, have often unwanted consequences, said also the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Wuerttemberg.
“The animals evade, large colonies split up and distribute themselves at other places.”
Vergrämung is conceivable only as exception at hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
“We must live them with them, we get no longer away.”
Without the surrounding countryside let yourself the problem in the cities not solve, meant mayors Wolfgang waiter from empty.
A combination of Vergrämen of the animals from sensitive living areas and loss leaders is conceivable, in order to settle it in other places again.
“Against it the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for completely different handling the animals recruited info. boards instead of chain saws”: “We can bear a pimple in the face finally best self-confidently.”
Jürgen had in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger crow didactic exhibition along-justified, at which signs inform about the life of the high-intelligent seed crows.
The project is in the meantime already accepted by tourists.
Also to the criticism at the noise of the birds Jürgen's its own opinion had: “There a lot of communication is, those has itself much to say.”
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows do not only use aids, in order to come to a delicacy, but manufacture as aids their tools even.
Behavior researchers of the University of Cambridge tested recently at four seed crows, as far the intelligence of the birds extends.
In an experiment the birds learned fast that they must bring a stand with stones to the collapse to arrive at a moth larva.
Without they recognized much training purposefully, which size and form a stone must have, in order to let the platform collapse.
In a second attempt the smart crows had to then solve a trickier problem.
In a perpendicularly set up cylinder the researchers a small Eimerchen with a moth larva had placed.
With the bill the birds could not reach their booty.
However the researchers them had put wire malice down.
From this all four animals formed a hook, with whose assistance they fished then the Eimerchen at the grasp from the tube.
This succeeded to three of the four seed crows even at first attempt.
