EU-Botschafterin Vicenová:
The Czechs did to the reputation of Negativisten and confidence
The Treaty of Lisbon means that one made the balance under the individual institutions from the track.
I would not expect that such a hard war is becoming..
It will discuss five, six years are continuing to be until settling the dust and all in their new role itself have used, began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, very strongly to their presentation to the legal faculty..
How is the motto seriously on Europe is understandable and open, they have demonstrated to be able we, on the first part of their speech, in which it managed it; the individual institutions describe of the EU, and their mutual relations on such a limited amounts and understandable way, the fact that it is so some Lektor of the legal faculty of the Karlsuniversität would therefore, and it
Madam Vicenová here praising also of the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
Initial criticism, was loud, he was too quietly - a grey official, the equal of such a role, but I have to say, it has up short all the efforts, as well it, for the matter itself was adopted.
He is human who it brings to deal, listening 27 Member States can wait idea, how to communicate with them, and the clear first everything from which has, as it should continue with the EU.
The new position of high representative for stated Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then as a response on the issue: who is in fact - for the European Union I ring What the number? ', so as an important step towards agreement and better readability of the EU 's policy towards States, as, for example of China or India;
That anyone we ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Madam Vicenová devoted also of the agenda, under the subject of the European union was removed, living in the near future action to live.
The Czech presidency before two years described as success
The Czechs had organised the financial crisis and the gas crisis to be successfully handled and also the summit for Eastern Partnership.
It referred in the event of the government during the presidency as great Negativum, which the image, the Czech Republic was harmed much. am a bit worried that this may be meant to be 'procurement'
The Czech representation in the European Union has now fully to do to all hands:
With the words, the ambassador of the situation, which it said not only in the chair, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not overcome to date still, rather in a state of panic;
And when adopted even the Sieben-Jahres-Budget to the EU, the matter because the today 's economic situation is much more complicated, but they
That it will be a slim and rigour budget, the economic sectors received over the countries and what less to promote states - all this is now to the agenda
The ambassador reminds also to their own slogan, with which they came after Brussels: to understand about Europe;
If I do not, we are gräuliche sWIFTs to contend, are not in their vocabulary and academic jargon has started, the nobody is quite clear.
How I know as citizens in fact, whether we are at Brussels really curly or round of cucumbers and different great bananas are invented just now, or whether we want to ban the person Quargel really.
You use the soil to the EU, even want this order to get more Czechs in European institutions.

Following opinion of the EU-Botschafterin are the Czechs in reputation Eurosceptics to sein more of the negative, as positive sides perceive the matter.
All the more galling is that the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
That many factors are responsible under other things, also the restraint of our candidate, whose inability to support is not especially to write Motivierungsbriefe and weak to the Czech side:
In addition to the successful Czech presidencies, they emphasised the force and cooperation of the Visegrad-Gruppe, the so-called V4..

Madam Vicenové, according the EU expect in the future before all hard rules for the Budget-Politik of Member States.
And much reeller, which was when a European Federation does it on the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds..
We here have the country in the zone and the countries to miss the Eurozone
We have Schengen area and we already have the institute of a bestärkten cooperation.
First time said that should only work together the countries, which it want and which should, which it do not want, could be absent;
