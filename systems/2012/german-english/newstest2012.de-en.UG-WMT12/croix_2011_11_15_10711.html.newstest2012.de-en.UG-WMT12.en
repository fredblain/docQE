Why will the unemployment of disabled or subordinate workers so high level?
About 19% of the disabled people are on search for a work, as well
Today begins die15, a week of the work for disabled people.
Despite an activist Öffentlichkeitspolitik, who was introduced in 2005, is the unemployment of highly always twice so when disabled people as the average average: 19% contrary, 9% Arbeitlosigkeit to the total population.
Be discouraging?
No, stresses Éric Blanchet, director-General of the Association Adapt, the week of the work in hand for people with disabilities.
The progress that has been achieved within fifteen years, are considerable:
Then, the unemployment was not twice, but a triple such great:
Nevertheless remains enormous much to be done.
We say, however, that disabled unemployed still many obstacles to stay, before they are getting a work..
More, it is the older people: 37% older than for 50, are of transport by the year.
They are on a low level of qualification: 80% they have no baccalaureate and it are only 10, 000 people under the 2.3 millions of students with higher qualifications.
Finally, it is also the long-term unemployment to be very widespread: 53%, the people with disabilities with 38% in Gesamtschnitt.

Of the 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure to the companies, said Pierre Blanc.
However, these improvement also brings a real recognition in particular proposals for the groen Firmengruppen on a resolution;
According to the ministry for work, only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 employees disabled employed people, dealing with 100 to 199 people against 82%
