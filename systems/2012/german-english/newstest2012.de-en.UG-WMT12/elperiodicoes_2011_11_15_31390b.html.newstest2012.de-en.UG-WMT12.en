Park or Berg?
The architect in addition by quarrels on the professional fees with the tender in agreement
The urban tender on 16 gates that gives the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona on new.
Middle of 1980er years published, the culmination of meantime disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona of those administration to their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described to the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona City.
He compared even in figures with the Central park of New York.
The sinking of CMB in year in 1987 of the park in the view was many to restore to ceiling of Barcelona because the capital city of Catalonia one to the few, which do not spread in time, but after the top and down..
The classification of Collserolas and natural park plays with this idea.
An example was not more of the Central park but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of Yogibärs.
So far There was as the city that he was in September, a Riesenausschreibung from 16 competitions, for another Zugangstore after Collserola.
Certainly one door correctly highlights to the concept of parks.
Either is it the case or someone has, on country to the challenge.
The question arises of themselves: Collserola, Park or Berg do
The call for tenders is the subject for discussion in mouths of architects from Barcelona, not only from organisational point of view, but also in relation to a reflection on the city.
It is already almost a rekurrentes issue, on which two members of this old eingesessenen caste, which itself are meeting in a lift, are able to resort.
And it is precisely this fact will offer the substance for one of the rare consensus between the various governments, which think three architects from the Barcelona about, and some university who have to be advertised on the project, as
Miguel Roldán; Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the call for tenders is appropriate;
For Roldán that it is necessary to speak to the attack on the coast on the front on mountains, as far as the debate by Ildefons Cerda, is being fought on green apples, and
We take the principle that precisely the utmost park is of beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more as a function of the architect, for the door of Collserola title involves a lexikalische case in we must not imagine it as access on a park, but as the definition of areas on which we need to act.
Modol how Roldán and Bayona use of high-quality public experience, quite the proposal as a intellectual challenge, the certain dangers, which poses itself.
Risks resulting from the uncertainty, who brings the creation of a public area today with following the experience from the 1980er for years, which were their swan-song in the field of the forum.
The first fear is the limit on what must be developed to be.
Something is to limit always, to set the next step, that means it to exceed.
We must think, on new urban planning tools, because the present, lead to a genuine disaster..
Modol, the more closely the issue is, about it simplifies, the side of Collserola, which is in the direction of Vallesana, can understand as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, not, and for purely topografischen reasons:
Modol reminds, that it already have a study by employers, Mr de Collserola, which face on deaf ears, even though it is the council is stepping grateful, for it has given his body to the possibility, this project from the first moment to be involved.
He realises also, that the vicinity of mountain life on city in the Geleitbrief is the enabling of the architects, to participate in the debate, although he expresses his doubt, which will determine whether the technical profile, guiding the multidisciplinary teams created into lives, we rather should only be a tool, at
Bayona indicates that the answer on the question in the title of this article is complex, when the tender conditions of a global vision of Collserola at the moment: it tender 16 competitions in cross-section, he says, on the axis Gebirge-Meer.
It has held at least in his case to the Council, that it is participating in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme to some conflict and the definition of a project for a door with the architect of the Tors in addition.
Its opinion is that the city to guarantee it is important, that the strip directly is above the Ronda de Dalt is in its whole out so, which is a soft transition between it creates the city and Grünzonen.
