Step off the tarmac of the UNAM verhindert Schlaglöcher
Rafael Herrera, develops researchers on the faculty for chemistry to the Mexican university UNAM with Polymeren in a modified form Asphalte, so to make the ingredients become more robust to climatic conditions and variations in temperature
That would respect on the sign which start by Straßenbelag, who would be not, it need, to repair nearly 200000 Schlaglöcher, if the rainy season in Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México breaks out, says Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher on the School for chemical, with the university UNAM, also, and assured that when the adoption placing and the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags is properly that considerably in need, the number of Schlaglöcher or even fully will avoid.
In his presentation Schlaglöcher, both from a technical point of view, he considered, on the occasion of the international year on chemicals, he was aware that the laboratory for which it is responsible, is developing into modified Asphalte with Polymeren, in order to establish the asphalt with the same mixture, which however has a greater mechanical resistance, both in high and also in low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extreme hot climate, how countries of the north of the cities in certain such being spent, so to improve the behaviour of the road surface is, avoid, the incidence of Schlaglöchern.
He said, that the asphalt is a Kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, of who is a part of a high Molekulargewicht and the other part is a low - which is so these Malthene, the most serious part of oil the so-called Asphaltene
Means Zähelastisches actions of Asphalts, this in high temperatures of almost 180 °C as a flow is the situation, in 120 °C very is zähflüssig, and 50 °C is almost while he will be fragile in much low temperatures.
But does a day in accordance of the weather and temperature fluctuations, led out of the chemical engineer.
Of the researchers, the FQ said, the road of Mexico City, a majority would have a flexible Straßenbelag, itself zusammensetze from six Materialschichten, of which the last three asphalt involved.
Between the classes, a Verschleißschicht lies, for asphalt, who would insist from small, gebadeten in asphalt and then hardened stones.
Every single piece of these Verschleißschicht, was been with all my clothes on, being in asphalt, which is
When the vehicles must to proceed, and forces produced, this class allows a good Kräfteverteilung in Straßenbelag.
If it, would be amended asphalt, the forces would become to distribute even better, thought the chemical engineer.
On the Verschleißschicht, it has led, will be interpreted to a final layer, who is so this Tragschicht, which is from tiny stones, that is from sand the was also with all my clothes on, being in asphalt.
Given this class in contacts with the car tyres, must produce it is a greater mechanical force as the Verschleißschicht and they must friction..
Which receives of these Straßenbelag of the most forces and to some extent; the Tragschicht is being distributed, is required to keep an appropriate thickness and the material, from where they is also..
The weather has said in particular water and temperature changes, are other, important, too taken into account factors, first of all things to the water, he because there does the behaviour of Verschleißschicht is considerable.
If the premises is as wet, as a matter of urgency of water in the class and is as just difficult once again, that causes a relaxing of sections of the road surface is, and consequently, the emergence of Schlaglöchern.
If a Schlagloch, he said, will be flattened to begin the Deckschicht, while the Verschleißschicht will only then affect.. however, the damage is emerging not immediately, but it is a process, in the first signs by appropriate Wartungsprogramme should be kept.
The members of the Council Sistema Nacional de Investigadores said that the Fahrzeuglast is another important cause for the incidence of Schlaglöchern. therefore had the thickness of any class of the road surface is, always, there are regarding Fahrzeuglast in the relationship and it must be ensured, that for preventing it will be complied with this regulation of frequent Schlaglöchern..
Rafael Herrera had to point that even many research on waiting for example on Asphaltemulsionen, which are in other countries, even on the market, and with which the Schlaglöcher, simple and not applying themselves on water purification of high temperatures.
