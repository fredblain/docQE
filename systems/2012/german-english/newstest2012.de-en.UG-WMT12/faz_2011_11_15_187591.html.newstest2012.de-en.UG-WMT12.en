The Skandalbank by Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste Bank Europe is not in Italy or France, but in the Switzerland
The of UBS had schlittert in the financial crisis of almost bankrupt and since then of a crisis in the next.
Now it should be a German to address.
As this thought Axel Weber, no doubt, and
Again after his spectacular departure, who was caught by the top of the Bundesbank in July, the fact that he would take to a nearly equally spectacular new job in 2013: Verwaltungsratspräsident to the Swiss Großbank of UBS - a unexpected and lucrative Karriereschritt.
Axel Weber was in public, praising Switzerland whether a matter covered their beauty and the of UBS, whether their new lessons in expenditure while guaranteeing sound and allowed kind remarks about the future colleagues.
Who of UBS managed the Turnaround;
I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger, and Oswald Grübel.
But already in September was clear that would come very different everything, including
One the of UBS traders, in London had been gambling found themselves all security system of the bank evasion and around the euro 1.7 billion;
UBS-Vorstandschef Oswald Grübel; a banker gerühmter do not only in the Switzerland, go.
Of the Verwaltungsratspräsident, the of UBS since then, is also a poor shape - and all ' when to play at Axel Weber?
Already been aware that Weber are discussing the bank of February 2012 in that.
It already takes not, and the Verwaltungsratsvorsitz in May - only in 2013, how the bank told on Tuesday.
The Union for Axel Weber will be severely one;
It is not in other, but Ökonomieprofessor and Notenbanker, and would have to have had a Einarbeitungszeit of course need.
With a blow, it takes the responsibility for the strategy to a Bank, which has just once again demonstrated that they long deserves the title 's largest Skandalbank of Europe.
Because the of UBS schlittert one hand references are enormous and other for years of a scandal in the next, and recently it has the biggest asset managers of the world
Nothing seems, is spared of the once such pride of Swiss Bank.
It began in the crisis..
And 2007 which of UBS was an excellent reputation. this
The image was combined to express the suppressed and solid, but also ausgebufften of the Swiss Vermögensverwalters with ambitious objectives: you wanted in Investmentbanking to a huge number.
So the of UBS 2007, managed one hand with $1.6 billion to put more money vermögender customers than any other bank of world.
And also they all huddle together as a Investmentbank in the league of the greatest banks of world..
Which made it seems.
Of the former bankers and subsequent long-standing Bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans following to tell us: my students, along the of UBS at that time more as models of a good Bank.
From today view, asking itself am irren it, how could I just such that?
He wrongly are enormous.
In 2007 was first obviously, for something should be bringing substantial schieflief in the of UBS..
The middle of year was surprisingly done, Peter Wuffli, the idea in the meantime than hochintellektueller and equally genialer bankers applied.
Some months we guessed, why he was gone.
The Investmentsparte of bank had been gambling found themselves with Subprime-Papieren and might as well forget about billion;
Saddled the of UBS, it has announced to a capital increase am saying in level of and schreibe to 13 billion francs.
For they found investors, but what, on which some gerümpft, until briefly before of the nose even: one intransparenten Asian funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, the way was concealed that told you to his behalf not again, a concept
But this was only of the first blow.
In April 2008 and it was worse;
The Bank had known a new deplored, Verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel Ospel, management board nor the 2006 paid on zweitbesten Switzerland, was back
In October 2008 that was followed by the disaster: now embark on the of UBS was saved with their investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had the authorities..
The Central Bank bought as from the of UBS for many tens of billion problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has six billion francs for a Zwangswandelanleihe, on which they will Miteigentümerin of the bank was
The whole Switzerland was shocked too, because they said, how dramatically it is for a small country, if it so accommodates great banks. the
Finally the balance of of UBS 2007 was more than five times so great, such as the Swiss economic performance.
Again, we will save the of UBS, said Bankenforscher following:
The first disaster closed itself to the second, and we

Also it was a payment of dollars more than 780 millions - and the reimbursement of unjustified profits from this business and Strafaufschlag.
Thus the of UBS was acknowledged longer or less openly, to help in the tax evasion. -
While they lost something, which has been always been since their capital in competition about rich customers: the Nimbus of secrecy;
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was not more the same.
There was the resignation of CEO and Verwaltungsratspräsident..
And the exodus of Kundengeldern;
As the Bank in the space of a few months lost its credibility in both key portfolios: in Investmentbanking, the Fehlspekulationen in the asset management by the aid on tax evasion, which is
And it as was again somewhat calmer, just as it was under the impression, now the of UBS intend to establish it once again, since item is this unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual of traders verzockt euro 1.7 billion, before the bank can see that rather going wrong.
And it will obviously: using the risk management in Investmentbanking, it does obviously always still.
With the Adoboli, did to see it that the risk control is changed too little, says Martin Janssen, economist and Finanzprofessor on banking institution of the University Zurich.
Also of the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is certain: the problem of UBS is that they not has the risk control in control.
In it, but precisely which has been the idea to the caution, with the Swiss bankers before long time set out, werden the guardian of the great assets of the world: no excessive risk was perhaps to collapse for security for money, in other words: also beyond the Alpenrepublik in the world.

The centre of of UBS in Zurich does still on the classic dichotomy of excellent Swiss, one, it is rather just a greater

This idea of the Swiss bank beef both Swiss banks, of UBS and the Credit Suisse, but at some point - or as well as betraying how taken of the leader of a small Swiss, one.
His name to read it rather in the newspaper, he makes finally, as all Swiss financier, also with the two big banks to do business..
To the of UBS if much too great, it will - especially in Investmentbanking, where is a sigh of the Anglo-Saxons also;
The Swiss people would have to say there no more.
And when surely they are adapted long of the customs of the Anglo-Saxons.
Actually it was the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking, that of UBS changed it only high profits, and then now fear, the debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in Subprime-Dschungel, like the Swiss Großbank..

It helped, that supplemented the two different Vorläufer-Banken of UBS: internationalisierte to have a rich but verschlafene bank with the emphasis of asset management in Zurich, and a poorer, but already more.
Suddenly, the internationalised Investmentbanker came good to a lot money, with which they could revolve a huge wheels.
Two names have linked with this promotion of UBS: Peter Wuffli from 2001 to 2007, company himself of of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, who was then the chairman of the Administrative Board.
I was thinking always, Wuffli and Ospel were a Traumteam, says Bankenforscher Hans following.
Hochintellektuelle to the Wuffli and Bescheidene, and the deal of models and statistics is clear, and Ospel, the Bauchmensch, comes the top heraufgearbeitet of the Banklehre by one.
But Ospel have left to the conclusion on Wuffli.
And Wuffli have made the end, probably a decisive mistake: he was thinking, his models are the reality, says following.
This is a tragic case
Tragic, perhaps..
Is clear: an excess came before the case;
Employees of the of UBS will remember themselves clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings, on which company himself Wuffli who was living the same slogan more again: Goldman Sachs made in the throne of opinion;
