V Need, a natural person for Speed: the run for energy - the illegal race across the Americans
Review
The original sorglose journey by one series completely of preventable dilettantischer mistake on Routinefahrt to Frühschicht.
It managed certainly, to meet the ambitions on large part, but what use already when obviously nobody wishes, a bit to do.
Already before he was the Ladentische, the new part, offering with the subtitles with the welcome turgidity expect a great deal.
Promised it yet, which have seemed old Spieleserie Need for Speed to restore a piece to be postponed in a new dimension and the spielbaren Demonstrationsbeispielen, it need to sein actually not only is one many Action-Rennspielen. the
We were also curious how the eingepassten passages ausfallen, is rising in the Hauptprotagonist from the car and become to get a foot.
However as it is used in NFS already, it is ultimately much differently, as we had expected the way;
Sure - potentially it quite is that the good Arkade-Rennen, but the game is compromised by some unnecessary mistakes, which are more or less already few years for present, in this series.
So really are no mistakes in a more rather sign principle can not keep laziness to the Spieleentwickler.
The adventure begins very good
Firstly we are imported in the history, which like to think of flag, has personal nature problems; the only solution seems to sein to participate at a illegal race across America.
In the San Francisco, so the west coast, is we came against the steering wheel, with the task, sein the first New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements;
The entire route has distributed in ten stages and longer, as 50 individual race.
It means that every race on other route will be conducted and that the individual stages in different sexes is sufficiently varying, and of interesting environment to take place
We offer no moment to give the impression that game would always again be same.
Some environments are all to see even very nicely, even though the technical level of the graphic display is not more on the former parts of the series that on.
Therefore not, the lay-out;
But the driving by means of the desert, by herbstliche landscape or highly high by profound verschneite landscape we visually very like:
It is sometimes again atypical elements that bring a little change in the individual race..
The desert for example surprised of a Wüstensturm, the idea very restricts the point of view.
In the mountains, in turn to ensure it extremely carefully that we not will be verschüttet of an avalanche.
Incidentally be incorporated into very good to cut the individual race..
Only a few, but they are adequate.
For a while, they are trying so to overtake the compulsory number of opponents, then has time of making up time, then a One personal international expecting with a single sides.
And he is intervening also still in the police, the one will vermasseln the whole thing.
An innovation of voters, they are of the passages, in which Jack is leaving the car..
Here it is more certain of interactive Animationen, should flee in those Jack before any someone and where the players are helping, when is it that the right button in right moment.
So not delude ourselves.
It surprises, however, that it is much less such of the passages in game, when would be entitled to expect it.
Ultimately it is the matter more for the benefit, because this element has a least do not stand a chance of boring to werden - it belongs which have been said in context for high on the elements, who to diversify to make the game.
To the Fahrmodell and lack in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
It means, by finally centre, although no trees, and on the other hand we say, it would be bad.
If realistic simulations is seeking, itself are forced in other places.
However a aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren, also the European Fahrmodell will continue quite well fair, although one better in the competition to find.
Meanwhile, it is as far as everything in the best order;
Real problems, have disappeared only after certain time. this
In contrast to the Fahrmodell, is the Kollisionsmodell not very essential K.
Of one game this type, calculated not to expect that it complicated Deformationen and collisions, but when it is practically before any impact on any one object idea, how the car is then obviously not all in order
Typical example throw light upon the close that did or Vorbeifahren on oncoming cars on some posts of the other car, only easily, in others, almost identical situation is however into arrows and centres headlong performance..
Or goes the Karre at scrap metal.
Thank the Restart-Systems which makes out although not further, from annoying, it is finally for it.
Is the Restarts to resolve so: if we did write-off or far be absent of the line ends up, then the first, raises the game to the last point of reference of the route.
Just in each race was only of five Restarts.
If we, it has been exhausted, is going all the right direction..
The Restarts therefore rather is such a thing as a tool for the case that it does not succeed, but about should leave itself not and we would rather.
Sometimes helping not just of Restart, because helping not different, as to learn the critical section from their heads.
Very unpleasant, that the same things are often the same posts going to happen.
Some trends that pass through it for example to the whole of specific kind and way, otherwise it fits simply.
Elsewhere we will be further damaged in the relevant point of civil cars are always regardless in the same configuration, whether it comes as first or fifth or five seconds sooner or a minute later.
Which is particularly annoying in situations when we can see that the comes round opponent as far as we are concerned before a cars who is happily on two oncoming, however important, even there by it and slow down the cars already in such a position that they steered or need, I
And it is not when important people they and it is all designed the fact, for it is always close to this situation before your nose.
The sides are still further advantages
In the whole game, there are a few posts, where we are always out of date to the same point by same opponents and also here again without consideration on the time:
To happen on Verrücktesten, for conclusion of the game on the long bridge, which we are counter.
The opponent as far as we are concerned must be disturbing, overtaking a here seem to the devil to escape.
And it is then already sometimes before a, then he is a naturally adopted to the view, sodass it there are initially the own cars to travel a few time in Klump.
Be clear - we will make the game simply more exciting and aufregender, but this intention is vermiest so clearly, that they quickly have the pleasure on game..
And that it is a pity, because despite einfacherem Fahrmodell, the game is also so aktionsgeladen as a whole is very entertaining and There has been a certain amount, for aware, almost we not more; which is the head, one;
And in principle is no matter, which is the blame to point - the concept with the 50 unique routes, the orders of the race on a way for that can raise no boredom, or rather quite different
An unusual idea is the Wagenwechsel in the course of the race;
We must not overlook it the petrol stations to the route, because just here there can change the car, although the most cases, the car is sufficient, which we has just.
The car divides in three categories.
The prams are well appropriate, for the urban areas, the strong American brand for the draft of motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys, for example on the Serpentinen in mountain regions.
Hand in hand and the way of the Spielgeschichte is also the Aufgaben-Modus - so, at the end of the day to the in the various hiring out, which it knows from the history.
Here, it is not just some medals, but also Erfahrungspunkte winning for the own profile, which work together for the tasks and the history is
In order to reach the higher Fahrerniveau, have caught up various objects: starting by cars, including to the Backgrounds for the profile, and so it is
That it is linked in parallel with the Online-Funktion Autolog, which provides its own achieved results are compared with those other players and also for further collective functions under other things.
One further incomprehensible Schnitzern has a situation in last race of the story
Here it is: the car in an underground rail tunnels, where rast as shadows on the railways that we have been.
On Tacho paragraphs looking between 150 b 200 kilometres per hour, but is suddenly of the cart before a metro and drive a uncompromising to scrap.
In our text, we may still argue for long time about the fact that this was a blackout of Spielgestalter, or whether we think the authors for stupid.
The technical side is no Überwältigendes but the visual overall picture is very attractive in most cases and here there even brilliant.
Is all the more galling is that some exciting moments are of becoming the Bildwiederholfrequenz more slowly and it is sometimes quite tragic
This subject however, notably of the accidents with major number of parties concerned, in which a continuous FPS in any case nothing benefit.
The Tonwiedergabe is as far as O. K. and the Soundtrack is Geschmackssache..
In its endeavour, to raise a broad, as only possible scale, rather young audience, of a Soundtrack arose a lá of each something - but who buys such a game already because the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: the run for energy, ' the feelings are rather also true.
If the game, the aforementioned total unnecessary mistake, not diminished, we would be able to compete with the held conviction, for the run for energy is the best piece of NFS in the recent years.
But so the game in some way does immature;
In itself, should be prepared for a one pleasure but we support to say that one such mistake with the Power sting of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes, and it
