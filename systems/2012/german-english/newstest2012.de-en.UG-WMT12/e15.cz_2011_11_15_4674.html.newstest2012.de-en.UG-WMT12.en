Fire means:
The Innovator IBM enters its existence into second century
Look after a suitable word that the strategy of IBM described on genauesten then, that the word 'long life cycles.
For the broad public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it knows, although a modern companies, it has been his creation already a century is passed.
The basis that long life cycles already presented its first leader, the visionary, Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already represented the slogan, with countless global problems would resolve easily, if people would be prepared, a little consideration in that respect:
His slogan, Think, was for trademark, about which the life of the future giants is if being struck.
It was also that the basis of the business culture, thoroughly prepared of Watsen.
For us does from IBM of this long-term thinking, a kontinuelle movement in direction future;
IBM survived the earlier, and I was another reason why a whole century is successful, because it has remained its principles to be true and not zurückschreckte, to change all others among its neighbours;
It allowed to us, in the course of our first century, transforming the technologies, the business and also the society.
We hope we are creating in the next one hundred years more, said Bishop Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company from reason of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
The Watson carried social care of its workers in the 30 years - on the same way, how the entrepreneur Bata in the Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute were as one of the first American workers paid on holiday, an insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as Arbeitsbekleidung and have a thought-out Entlohnungssystem for better innovators and traders.
As we are more sophisticated, the long-term relations of IBM and its customers
That companies choose of beginning to great in the Talentförderung and was accordingly to make. as first first companies, the world lifted to IBM of any discrimination
In line with this Antidiskriminierungsstrategie, it is also the current plan, the Palmisan to the head of IBM in next year of a woman is abgewechselt of Virginia Rometty.
Which is already for thirty years in IBM, so far, they adopted a position of Vetriebs-, marketing, and Strategiechefin.
IBM will make in the recent years 'Online-Brainstormings, that will accrue from those many future strategies and innovations.
No miracle gives of ideas - it enough be at company, even working almost a half a million people.
An institution with good reputation
Your firm 's position on business guarantees to the company, a strong image and this following home, and after foreign.
Right from the start was IBM, rather the concept of an institution, and a mere Technologie-Unternehmens, on says Economist, the teacher of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
IBM does not technological companies will locate, but rather a company, the Geschäftsprobleme to resolve by means of technologies, has always fallen to add that George Colony, created by Consulting-Firma Forrester Congressional Research.
As the companies themselves stressed, it is a difference to shape sein just present on the market or it by this presence directly.
Called IBM in the States of their logo for familiär food, Big Blue, in a century to companies of the greatest one of the world.
This is one of the vielseitigsten technological companies will locate at of Servern to the point on the nanotechnology.. IBM is developing systems, hardware and software infrastructure, Hosting and Konsultationsleistungen in a incredible Produktbreite
By all United States technological companies will locate IBM is an excellent one, the most staff already for five of its patents and have been achieved with the Nobel Peace Prize.
On his most famous inventions include Bankautomaten for example, diskette is also the buying of goods by means of credit cards, Finanzswap, or that.
With some $220 billion effrontery, IBM has been in this year of the second-largest technological companies will locate, which it took over for the first time since 1996 on Microsoft.
The advance
Not to all products and innovations which met the taste of the customers of today - unfortunate for example of the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online-Service were Prodigy or the computers, IBM is bound to continue using PCs jr.
Business is on the moving forward, therefore we tie emotionell to the past, believes this Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem, can be constructed of his ground on various platforms - and if they work, to leave it again.
In contrast to a rival of Microsoft, the idea does in principle with its operating system Windows or fall of proposal;
Promising technology
To the profits of IBM, participating services in great extent, educational software and hardware to each one fifth.
This more 1990 was representing hardware with a longer fünfzigprozentigem share on most.
Invested IBM bit profit abwerfende assets in value of dollar of 15 billion, veräußerte since 2000, in the same time, however 58 billion dollars in the shopping in sectors with a future technology.
In these Investionen, IBM, even after 2008 to travel continuing as the modern financial crisis on of the same name swept of a storm on the world for the first time as it.
Also here, IBM was the legacy of his first head of Thomas J. Watson in good, the greater its Investitionsumfang in the middle in the great world crisis.
Before, it would appear that the companies, IBM survives the today 's crisis without prejudice.
The value of IBM-Aktien has increased raketenartig since 2008 to 120 per cent and the make a net profit of the company is growing kontinuell..
The Unternehmensslogan of IBM is Everything does not just the values..
Also expected, that of this flexible giant which also must manage the next crisis.
