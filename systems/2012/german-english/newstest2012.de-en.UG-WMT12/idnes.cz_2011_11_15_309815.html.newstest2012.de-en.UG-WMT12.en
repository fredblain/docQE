Professional sportsmen to say a Stylist - also a good psychologist
Had gemeckert about, how Stylisten will be able, in introductory article, I have a bit that this was a bit to every substance for the beginning.
When I guessed in any way which still is
To hear of three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how this is the place.
It get, even worse:
Ever closer places of the examination, we are ahead so more of information and practical tasks.
But also when the way forward is taking on Saturdays, and on each, he nevertheless is documented fully. it privileges
This time we discussed with Director Alena, how a madam attracts the not perfect proportionierte figure;
And these are still the majority of us.
There are those who have a neck on short, who else are a jungenhafte figure without other proper turns and once again mollig:
There is cause of Stylisten, at concealing look broad shoulders, numbers have been thrown about in an almost casual fashion and conjuring to extend the neck or the necessary trends.
We got too, which gave multiple advice, how it attracts a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez, it was pretty, and figurbetont, without it works too provocatively, so great Busen, hip and narrow Taille
For example, the difference between Taille and hips will give out, it is so great, that of no suit coat, or the pair of trousers really, if itself schneidern to let it at least a piece for degree..
It will not regret we undoubtedly, because well values to wear, is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made coat is committed it namely much better, than a of the piles, the tolerance extremely and verrutscht in the Taille absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters to allow in turn, to bear clothes with Falten, Bauschen, applications, or Raffung.
In this lot am the information and Figurtypen, I welcome that I have a whole week time, as to let me all thoroughly by the head..
And yet I have been afraid that there can not create almost, in the entrusted encouraging handovers is out -
Each Kursteilnehmerinnen was namely a Promi, for they devise appropriate Outfits. Tagesbekleidung and Abendrobe;
We are in the current appearance, the Modestil of the relevant stars and its Figurtyp to take into account.
I attract, Mr Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the campaign at the Victoria 's Secret.
Within I juble because this accounts for me to attract myself much better, as on such Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased I think in the last time in the 100 kilos, or even the young Selena Gomez..
The clothes should ausschneiden to look we from magazines or Internet, ausdrucken working, and then grafisch.
In Moodboard, the entire result called is intended to come then our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design expressed.
It is very important to reflect also on the graphic side of Stylings.
The Stylist namely prefers to the role models not just purely physically, but also more of the so-called Produktseite in the journalist.
From us tells of the Stylist and designers, Mr Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
In other words, a Stylist did a good overall picture.
Of Samstagsvortrag angefüllte, with information on Figurentypen has tinged right from three visitors from the industry:
By Stylisten to Jan Pokorný, the fashion designers Jakub Polanka, and by Modefotograf Ben Renc.
Jakub in Cairo reminded us to the fact that fashion illusion is and this is a Stylist to be able if, to exploit it as:
And eingeschickter Stylist can achieve to work with a single Bekleidungsstück on the whole in various ways.
The magic word means of variability.
So we should bear the example, a Trenchcoat, as usual, on the jeans, so as a T-shirt or veil, we carry it also on the bare body, Absatzschuhe to do and contribute than clothing it.
It goes, to the sleeves or to the affect down and equally of the entire look suits very provides different.
Play that, emphasised it.
At most I was the next council: first to her to know perfect to the rules.
Only you violate it, said Jakub.
Finally I will be clearly, why we have all these theories we must pauken, what we can combine with what, and why, even if we must be seen often in Modejournalen quite else;
To mention the whole of Modeschauen.
Thanks to the photographers, Ben, and I know that a Stylist is much to prepare more Bekleidungsvarianten as it, ultimately photographed.
So it is preparing for a Fashion story with ten sides to the point, at least fifteen to stylen:
And it is also that the clothing on the photograph in combination looks with other accessories, sometimes very differently, than reality
With everything, must expect we therefore in the management of Outfits.
The fact that images and Styl sometimes account the half of success, which we confirmed also, Mr Jan Pokorný;
As it needs only just look at Madonna, not have just brilliant singer, from the image and marketing of a world star with respect, have made.
In Tschechien and is one of the services of a Stylisten to be rather striving.
Also know people often think it for wasted funds.
And when already is obtained from us are stylen it we should expect that then it imposes us with a large likelihood, a different size, when he then takes in actual fact..
Then you need to googlen then only, in order to establish, with safety, that the tabloid press writes that the appropriate Promi again fallen or etc.
Jan and Mario showed us on Sunday to draw, to believe that a Stylist itself must zusammenzubauen will focus on the fashion and just that outfit. there you are
In its work communication, he has much more to do with the people, which it stylt and it must be a gewiefter psychologist.
The people einschätzen, without itself anzubiedern and his views.
If we to make any businesswoman also takes on management tasks, so to sift through their Kleiderschrank and to supplement about nice pieces, the situation will, we resolve the whole storage cupboard and hemp to my goodness, that is so terrible.
We at least must find a few worthy things, on which we should as be possible to bear to do, said Mario.
It was also very specific, which so will contain a so-called Platztasche.
So as a pocket, who we zuknöpft on the Taille and in the people to all necessary Proprietäten in itself, which is
Apart from this clear terms, how the gap between Abroller on Haareentfernen or Sicherheitsnadeln, which does not contain it also such Utensilien as a Nylonfaden, of specific Clips, with which the cart before the clothing will be gerafft, if it is too great and obviously Nähzeug.
Please understand that we not must listen however only, but also somewhat in practice can try, have learned as one, taking off your shoes properly unterklebt.
In taking photographs, on Atelier, can damage the floor just is, where we have the Schuhsohle, out the much less.
Us oC klebten, and we klebten
With the one touch, the shoes not even so that we, they are not damaged.
Therefore we do really skilfully.
Mario, was very pleased by praising my creation without restrictions.
The earlier great skill, namely not it is my great strength
All this, it was just the fraction of what we got on to hear in the case on second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs.
Is one that is becoming I now clearly - is too to pay the Styling to professional level, is not easy.
