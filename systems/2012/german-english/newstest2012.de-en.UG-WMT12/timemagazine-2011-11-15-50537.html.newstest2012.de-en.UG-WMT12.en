Walls did eyes: how researchers would see on Facebook
Before it has been on the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, has been by Anders Behring Breivik but one of many boys, which of their Anti-Einwanderungsmeinung online sendete.
On Monday was Breivik, the has been stood, committed to haben in a killing spree in Norway in July, when the 77 people were killed, the first public hearing before Court.
Although Breivik may alone be traded, it is not far from being alone in Cyberspace:
Following the tragedy to this past summer of researchers more find on these people..
But as we find it
That is easy, as we have seen page just in Facebook.
We have found that not difficult, to come too them, said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent, published report of the British Ideenfabrik DEMOS on the digital populism in European
Facebooks of playing hide-and-seek of personal information is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett, that the researchers simply need to use the Werbetool of the side, so exactly to set their desired demographic data, with scientific accuracy - as it retailers for years are doing, I am also sure that you
Bartletts team found a half of a million fans of extreme right-wing groups throughout Europe and visierte they will use Adds, but instead to verlinken with a new bond or a new Diätprodukt, invited an which Adds users on a survey, was needed in those following on her educational level, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Because Facebook were to leave us more than 10 000 supporters Bartlett and his colleagues, in the situation to question of 14, extremely at the right party in 11 European countries - without that they have only once in their office, too.
It is fairly new research method, says Bartlett.
Certain of the results surprised hardly; Online-Förderer of extreme right wing groups are often young, male and very frustrated on the immigration.
However in a way it is a striking distortion of those who remain who their Online-Aktivismus combine with a Offline-Aktivismus appears wiser, more democratic and less violent than those which sit behind their Computerbildschirmen.
DEMOs work is a example as Facebook to be a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, and medical researcher and political analysts are using the side, in order to study everything of health issues and even on Gesellschaftstrends, as in Likes, text and Statusaktualisierungen.
Working with more than 800 million users, who add the content on average of three per day, Datensupernova of a Forschungsboom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side increase in the title in the last five years to almost 800% of Facebooks.
To achieve some researchers for the good thing of Facebook to the fact that we are studying people by this side, which we normally with his Clipboard on the road..
When you used to trying to question people of the British National Party, it was very difficult, identifying it, in connection with
You initially had granted the party information and the would have these never entering, says Bartlett.
In Facebook which find all - you are directly on them;
Else saying that the side provides a possibility, and of the need to solve social health problems.
A current study discovered of Dr Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues Megan, of students who their Vollrausch discussed on Facebook, significantly more on Problemtrinken tend as student, which remained silent on this issue..
Moreno proposes, that equal students should supervise the side for example Wohnberater of a students and if these many Statusaktualisierungen postet.
You can not solve that this may be a problem, if you not have recognised, said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development on Children 's Research institutes in Seattle, the Washington post office.
We have found a possibility, of identifying vulnerable children, which otherwise found a parent -
Facebook would also constantly zapft of the data of its own people.
The Datenteam of hand has drafted the statistics on the Beziehungsstatus and Valentinstag, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Glücksindex
Yet to the users of Facebook will know that the side to monitor it whether they want now or, order is to können allow one winter crops of the hand, the own personal data..
But what if the users of Facebook Part of a survey, of who they have not yet, there is something to know;
When researchers have strict set directives, how they collect their data offline, is allowed on line everything.
I do not believe that many users even on the fact, on reflection, that a researchers study their profiles, says Neil Selwyn, a social analyst on London Knowledge Lab, a study from the 2006 in he looked at the public sides on Facebook of students..
What it affects, it was just their and their true friends
Then there is the issue of methodology.
Itself offline there are no guarantee does, that a Forschungsteilnehmer is absolutely honest.
On Facebook but does to know it impossible as a lot of the data in a Nutzerprofil and in contributions to be true.
What is saying on Facebook and what makes one of Facebook, outside, radically different things, says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn, despite its years as Technologieforscher, a Clipboard and a pen that you have still always, that they are the best Forschungswerkzeuge, which all can use.
There is no substitute for talking to go in the real world and with real people, he says.
Social research concerned to the social and a lot of social life is still offline;
