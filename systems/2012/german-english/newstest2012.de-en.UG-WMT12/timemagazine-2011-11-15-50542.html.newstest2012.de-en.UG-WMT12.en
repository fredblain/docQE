Cold and inhumane, seems in other Breivik Behring, on first time before a public court
Otherwise described Breivik of the man, the idea has frankly two Amokläufe, that were killed in the proposal in this summer in Norway 77 people, Behring even out in his first appearance against a public court in Oslo as a resistance.
I am of a Militärkommandeur in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Tempelritter Norway, he said before a court with more than 500 human
I am making to appeal against the court as you have received your mandate of organisations, the Hassideologien to support and this being followed by the multiculturalism to be supported.
I recognise, the laws, but I must admit I am not guilty.
The judges in Torkjel Nesheim, the umpteenth Breivik, during this monologue, because he not wanted to give Breivik to the possibility, use this hearing as a platform, on the, he can get to impose its own views on matters to express.
The same reason that he have denied Breivik, the mitbrachte a first written speech, the permission on the end of the hearing to the families of its too address victims..
Nesheim also ordered, that the police Breivik for 12 other few weeks in pre-trial detention reserves, it has four weeks, no access on the media. he said, that the authorities monitoring all missions and the whole of correspondence on eight weeks exactly.
Some 30 survivors and members of victims were taking in the hearings.
Some people came in the hope to see the view to können Breivik in others, did the confirmation that he is behind castle and end still.
All attended the objective that all amounts on a Wegschließen.
I was thinking, it affects cold and inhumane, telling a of survivors of Utoya to the Norwegian channel NRK.
Unpleasant, but me is further of a piece, having heard the suspects of view and the level. it has been
Breivik in producing a dark suit and a blue ties and mark a departure during the whole hearing and quietly professionally. he has looked of journalists and survivors in the eyes, when he was the building and again left to this.
Despite Breiviks bizarrem comments, he would form part of an greater resistance movement, came the judges to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that it would not demonstrate in favour, it would have had the complicity.
It is certain, that the attacks by 22 of July, seemingly has the work of individual extremists and not this group of a radical.
But this is facilitating automatically of the distress and the confusion, a whole nation or always there?
I wish he would, as a monster, however it does it is not said the members of a victim.
It is so much more easily, if it it would do.
