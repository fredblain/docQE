What lacked the candidate, del Valle, so to sein to the new Miss World Colombia?
Analysis of factors, the fact sector, Melina Ramírez Serna, not received the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14 th Misstitel.
Again Valle del Cauca was empty in the allocation of Crown for Miss World Colombia.
This time to give to Melina Ramírez Serna is satisfied, too for standing up on the Gewinnerpodium, a Silberkrone and the bond, that they and new Miss World Colombia 's eviction, is to put on show.
With which this night is committed as a result in Cartagena, where Miss World Atlántico adopted the crown and the cedar, something of themselves, is the Departamento at 14 Misstitel and Melina is heightened on the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which the crown had kept, almost in the hands of manufacturing waste, the stated Misses part: Rose Miriam Ospina Benoit, Clara Domínguez Borrero, Patricia Bellini Ayala, Lorena Álvarez, Mary Alzate, Mrs Olga María Arenas, Leila Blanque, Mónica Evers, María Consuela Pinedo, Diana Isabel Romero, Giselle Garcés Aljure, Catalina Giraldo and Stephanie Garcés Aljure.
The great question who now can constitute a lot, is as lacking?
Because the results is the decline of a large Favoritin, who had shown in any trial that they had on everything, in order to sein the new Miss World Colombia. not be for nothing, it was elected on Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, Title, which also received the Schönheitsköniginnen Taliana Vargas and the case with Natalia Navarro, and the crown of Miss World Colombia is increased with following House..
The first factor who applies as crucial, should be developed for the decision of the jury, the appointment for the first Miss, is that it has the answer on the question book What will most be influenced, and why? it was asked of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the author:
I have read a lot, I believe quite to the literature, I believe, it is a kind more civilised to take, I believe ultimately that the book which shaped for my children are most, ` the small Prince ', is a very very complex book.
Currently I read 'fault and expiation within programmes. There is a book to be undertaken by the universal culture, which should read we; I read just to a paper of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, to a beautiful book, the ` way ', in other words.
An answer which has itself civilise to little think firstly because the term 'and secondly because they not specifically said, influenced of each book of their mentioned be based on the way it, in the course of
However after the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina said, is to feel calm and happy to the result: the universe that is wise, it will happen, which needs to be done.
And everyone people: lest I ask a little bit ` the small prince '. it is great to promote books;
Under other things being said, that the Liebling ausgebrannt of El Valle;
Indicated and had the other candidates of making jealously, stresste what the Queen people who are therefore of stage could not shine.
And realised you in its first idea in Badeanzug on beach of the Hilton Hotel, and its two lifts in the Krönungsfeier..
Although they appeared sure in two, it surely was missing the force and the impetus, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did to being broadcast.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme as the direction casa when Channel felt RCN that the fact shows, that Melina for Miss World has been crowned with the fact that the candidate has been nominated, which is gaining during the competition of the most prices, not, will surely her finally..
In addition, Valle was the closure of the press from the way - a mistake to make.
A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince for the social work of the Jurie on their interest, what ultimately is the most important thing of national beauty contest.
It already is his reason, that two days before the compilation of international jury covers Lucy Doughty, said it sought a woman who is committed for the social affairs of country.
Beauty alone is for a Miss World Colombia. we must look beyond to focus on the Körperliche and the social perception, it is the fact that it has worked already before the participation on competition on projects, said them
There is speculation also, that Valle was sinned with their faults of the Derriere and the Fibrose, which it said in the Magengegend of tackling it, being; but it is a contradiction that it has selected because the jury as candidate for ` natural beauty 'with a healthy bodies, good in eating habits and good physical work;
Put some fact that Melina was not the best body that it better existed, but their problem with the Fibrose on gut, which was said to be honest to say for me little, the coach of the Königinnen, Jorge Hernán Orozco, to their marks on the last day.
Meanwhile, the journalist to Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is the view, the fault of the madam from Valle del Cauca if the surgical intervention, which they had subjected itself, on this.
The operations they are OK, Valle was aware, as they are making it is right.
Your body never is to have their strong side, they have to pay, and take this opportunity, at
Because this prices, the idea of the first time to grant the national beauty contest, came about after the appearance in Badeanzug of a cruel forecasts, which it should be, in the night. it has getuschelt of the word, so that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, so not in the from the crown they is coming;
Regardless whether it is true or not, the fact is that Melina is now on not of their Herrschaftsjahr, certainly as Queen, but as Princess, a position, which it offers the possibility, of representing to the appointment of the national beauty contest of Colombia in one of the international game shows.
But they will do as one of the Königinnen, the idea was escaped of the crown, despite their overwhelming speech for Cartagena, in the history eingehen.
