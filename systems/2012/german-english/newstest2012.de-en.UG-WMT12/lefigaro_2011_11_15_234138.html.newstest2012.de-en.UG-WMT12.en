The World gemä of the republican presidential candidate
Mitt Romney; Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalisieren in the simplification and ignorance on China, the Iraq and the assistance for Israel.
An krisengeschwächtes America complex world with simple, so not: feeling of blind ideas to carry?
If one listens the republican presidential candidates so, the voters could get almost to this impression.
Since some days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their fellow member of I, their thundering statements, as well as their statements on the Auenpolitik, this means for traditional republikanischem focus, repeatedly verlautbaren..
Comments about China, Iran and the Israel-Hilfe fall against slogans. , often in keinster ways reinforced
The threatening party on top Mitt has now expired in course of Romney on the appointment of the Grand Old to accuse to quote the Chinese before the WTO and they derWährungsmanipulation, leading issue in a American, that by the brain a temptation, due industries on Äuerste into Asia
Stupid progress, when this implications of the introduction of trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, and former ambassadors in China, under Obama and single candidate, seems to haben a mature vision of Auenpolitik, has paid that almost as of his emotion to the schmeichelnden attitudes to the air;
He calls to a tangible, but constructive Gesprächsaustausch with Beijing.
But Huntsman was not heard to stagnate because he, the downs of the opinion polls.
Reagan 's as representative
Romney had praised also military blows against Iran, if the sanctions on Stoppung of the Nuklearprogrammes to fail.
If I to be elected, the Iran end, Territories had getönt it;
Re-elected Obama and are getting it, the time bomb.
Auerdem has accused his Israeli enhanced military aid promise and Obama, have remained this partners towards commitments is guilty.
The entrepreneurs, Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, in turn is a shameful Aktenunkenntnis to take.
Recently, he called to the Chinese Militärbedrohung to give cons, since developing a nuclear power Pekingversuche - and seemed the fact auer to eight, and that China has been in 1964 Atomarwaffen military in possession is

It is far away by John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auenpolitischen emphasis.
The current Präsidentschaftskontrahenten that Reagan forward voted had won also simple ideas, and despite alledem to the end of the Cold War.
You are calling in memory, also Obama selbstein, to listen Amateur and water in its wine, what concerned the issue 's 'anti-terrorist'.
You are insisting rightly on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal seinerJungs from Iraq, of its indecision in Libya, what it tabled also call of weakness.
These Anfeindung however, not quite so at ease.
The population estimates rather positive assessment of the national security under Obama, which Bin shops are being closed down.
Since the Iraq, it is wary about involving before military interventions, which are engaged on paralysis..
Surprise should be to be.
