21er to the House in the Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion looks both back
Of Mrs Wiensowski
One to get an architectural history with the ups, and Happy End, ' set by the Austrian Weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels 1958 by price, has been in Vienna on Museum, was empty and bodies also descended into it.
Now it re-opened than Ausstellungshaus:
When it comes to the question of modern Nachkriegsarchitektur geschwärmt of clear forms, halls, Schwüngen and new construction materials, the typical terms of the faith on the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion looks both back of the architects, Karl Schwanzer, the Brüssler world exhibition in 1958, is a case and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion looks both back at that time to be handed to the Grand Prix D 'Architecture for his easy pending development Stahl-Glas-Konstruktion.
The construction applies so far as milestone contemporary architecture.
It made of the architect as we know, that the built themselves bought also in the next world exhibition of Austria.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was 1973, finally internationally known.
He as a temporary Ausstellungsbau planned themselves bought had established was opened after the world exhibition in Swiss Garden in Vienna Südbahnhof, converted into a civil one and 1962 museums are for a substantial reform of the twentieth century - it identified the 20er house..
Suited the building that was however neither space, and technically as Museum, no walls for hanging of the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless it is being exploited as long time, the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house, and
Since 2001, the buildings was over empty and was increasingly more.
Now to the architect of Adolf Krischanitz CoR of the pavilion looks both back, he is now 21er of the House and will be used in the future as museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere, on which the house heard there to the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.
Has prevailed the fresh Agnes Husslein-Arco, which has 2007 new director, of the Austrian gallery Belvedere;
Husslein-Arco. promovierte art historian with considerable career for other things in the youth presented to note as Eiskunstläufererin, in Sotheby 's, which set Guggenheim Museum, and as Gründungsdirektorin of the museum of the modern age, Salzburg, the reconstruction strongly in politicians and Denkmalschützern, they are the monies involved of public funds and private Sponsorengelder and then the use.
Except Gegenwartskunst, the works of Bildhauers of State, Mr Fritz Wotruba should be issued from ` Jaws 'Foundation, a café, and a bookshop to give it, and a Bürohaus built to do of its own;
Strict supervision, of small budget
For the implementation, was then Krischanitz the ideal person to work.
Not only because he has won to be restructured Joseph Olbrichs Secession of the sensitivity in Vienna and extended the competition because it, he studied in Schwanzer in the technical university in Vienna and the pavilion looks both back, it is an incredibly important place, in which he will have seen almost of the exhibitions of each weekend.
He knew of the Ur-Entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which have seen on its moving after Vienna and its Umnutzung to generosity and ease from that:
The current restructuring that it far was greater problems: the buildings was a Energieschleuder saying Krischanitz:
The Fensterprofile of the outside glass replacement, glasfaserverstärktes Isolierglas use and the Glasdach by particular safety glass.
Kältebrücken-Stahlträger should be replaced increasingly or made in this debate, while asbestgefüllte blankets to be cleaned and
Two Untergeschosse have room for the new use, a abgesenkter Lichtgraben between House and the cars with the roads will ensure the Belichtung, a bridge leads on the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer-Pavillon..
The original Außentüren has remained the house to delete in old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton.
And the Kinosaal is even still very well, as it was before, and I would like to express my feelings in that regard;
And that everything under strict supervision to the Denkmalbehörde, and with a small budget.
Often had to find a material, which is good and cheap, and also the Denkmalschutzamt was pleased, saying out Krischanitz and highlights a abrasive, belligerent, soil in Untergeschoss..
Despite constraints 's problems and improvements to be made to the building, it is left with flexibility and easily.
Difficult it is to have been with the pavilion looks both back, than usual, from Brussels, has said Krischanitz from recent Committee 's overall budget implementation, as well as the financial and administrative management; a typical Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte. and
So one architecture am always on wrong place and would nevertheless be a proper awareness.
This case that 21er house is not on wrong place, because it has occurred a of high-quality public curiosity: at the Swiss garden round, that creates it this completely new plan Hauptbahnhofsquartier, with Büro- and houses.
And another stroke of luck will arise perhaps still: the 21er house could receive to strengthen of a other Krischanitz-Bau, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin of temporary Kunsthalle, and how one hears, negotiating it already with the city about a neighbourly location in Swiss, the back garden, contributing as much
