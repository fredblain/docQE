MSS has announced a Forschungsprotokoll to find of the gene for obesity
You shall direct Social Security Institution Mexico for a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and young people, which support of specialists of the IPN.
Announced to the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social IMSS - that it is a research project to a discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the Title Genetics, leading a preventive measure for obesity in children and youth of people, to which the genetic Marker is associated with obesity to be found;
The words of Miguel Cruz López, the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica on the clinic hospital to the de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that a multidisciplinary team, made up from doctors, has established nurses, Ernährungsspezialisten and social workers;
This team will support of specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs on Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politécnico Nacional.
The people invited to the participation in the study. interested parties can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in valley of Mexico, where any Saturday from 8 unanimous p.m. tests, will be carried out with children and young people.
He emphasised, that the study on the sports of Cuauhtémoc, which began for the 8 October on the sports of Nezahualcóyolt is continuing.
If the objective of 500 to 600 Untersuchungspersonen, the study will be completed to the sports of Independencia to be continued and on the Morelos, in
He said, the objective of the study is the knowledge of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronischer degenerative diseases.
The global day of diabetes, he said, it will seek that 3000 children and young people in the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents ernährungsbezogene questionnaires should fill.
You put, also needs questions on their physical activity and their domestic Krankheitsvorgeschichte, so to control risk factors, the diabetes or Niereninsuffizienz result could have the return of used plastic bottles.
That he has led desweiteren, the fact that the aforementioned opens on Saturdays of the Untersuchungspersonen, controlled in their blood pressure and Blutwerte is measured to be determined, like the Glukosespiegel Triglyceride Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors, it..
Cruz López said that this investigation be carried out at the concerns of the Gesundheitspersonals on the alarming weight gain of young people.
The Gesundheitsumfragen arose from the years in 1999 and 2006, in less than six years have increased of the proportion of contribution boys about 77% and the girls at 47% with obesity, the incidence also the obesity has risen dramatically, emphasised to the specialist of IMSS.
It was acceptable that the search for genetic markers is justified, because the genetic history of population of Mexico by the other peoples unterschiede.
It was acceptable that a Mexican people have an average on 65% was indianisch-amerikanischer on 30 per cent of European and 5 per cent of African origin, which itself reflects in the genes, which are with diabetes and are overweight in the context, it.
Very generally stated, he is the genetic make-up of the obesity would say itself from the inability, burn the surplus to the energy that we shall have the prospect, and sodass that in form of fat stocks stand.
The researchers said of the direct benefit for the Untersuchungsteilnehmer would be a comprehensive investigation of the children, when the said would be this one degree of obesity or obesity product.
Even it would be investigated to the incidence by dark Hautfalten in neck and on Innenarm, the less attention, the chance of Stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes in the preliminary stage on that, that.
All information in confidence were informed and the parents in writing to start from the doctors. the doctors will tell these issues for fear of the parents, all results of the measures and they are proposing the amendments of the way of life, which are appropriate to the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said there are three fundamental factors, which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic disease: just, that states of a lack of movement in their daily lives, which is to be used to spend more time of the day before the television and transport, going instead brief ways to feet.
The high Kalorienaufnahme that means that a greater consumption on gezuckerten drinks, and total carbohydrate, together with a high amounts of fat and Eiweißaufnahme and the genetics, which should analyse in this research project.
