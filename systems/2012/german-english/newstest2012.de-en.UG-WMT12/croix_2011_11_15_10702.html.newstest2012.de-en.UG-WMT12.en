North Stream, a new door on Russian gas in Europe is
The Gasfernleitung, North Stream, which is proceeding on the sea bed of Baltic Sea and linking directly with Russia, the Western Europe, has been placed in operation.
You provide the gas to have a equivalent of budgets of 30 tonnes.
Of the Russia Gasriese Gazprom to commit this event with glory and ceremony.
More than 500 geladene guests, including four heads of State or Government, attended last Tuesday in the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and Feinschmeckerbuffet of the official opening of the new Gasfernleitung, North Stream, which links Russia and Germany under the sea with one, directly.
The German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister, François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte did films are transported from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together that taxes of the Ventils, the Russian gas into Western European Network.
To do with the new Gasfernleitung provides 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year by a first pipeline of 1 length 224 kilometres, are the region, there has been quite a lot of St Petersburg, linking with Mecklenburg, following in Western Europe to be supplied. it bears no relation to contemporary society
I have another pipeline, who with a Gesamtlieferung allowing of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, the end of 2012. ready and the equivalent of French total consumption
And we already leaves the eventuality of construction of a third leadership on own route.
For Gazprom to the timely and punktgenaue completion effect of this victory of immense Bauwerkes like a..
The project was very controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord-Stream-Pipeline in fact will allow a direct gas supply after Germany, and in preventing any Trassenverlaufs by third countries on the continent.
From this fact, these two countries are losing a bit of their powers: for them, it now will be more difficult to exercise to pressure on Russia, by they are threatening, schliessen the access to Western European markets, for
Is committed, the most in the debate, employed at Warsaw, was not avoided before and be compared for the Nord-Stream-Pipeline with a new deutsch-sowietischen pact in connecting to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland during 1939, which
It means that the subject is politically äuerst of the sensitivity, the intention being
Western Europe has won a more supply by the support for this Russian project.
That however on the costs of a starvation of European energy, because the project has beaten a break between Western and Eastern Europeans. these
Russia has brought to enjoy it to deal in little five years ago, its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and their reserves for running out, as do, of enforcing
Such Gasfernleitung is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, us links on organic kind and way, confirmed François Fillon in the inauguration to increase the Gasfernleitung, when he pointed out in any extent to the groen Gasverträge by political and economic hand is important.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom-Manager in great numbers represented in Lubmin in terms of the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of Gasfernleitung is also a prominent art -
The Unterwasserleitung consists of steel with Betonummantelung which should protect against Schiffsankern.
It lies to the seabed, in some deep 200 m -
In its construction that is avoided its minefields from the second World War.
Approximately destroyed the mines hunderte cautiously removed or, had Mr Miller, the spokesman of the society of the North Stream, so.
Auerdem had taken greater Manahmen for the Protection of the animal life and flora.
The management does, a long queue from metal, seriously like 242 Eiffeltürme, which is suspended on the entire length by nothing: , no by outlets, still Wartungsstationen.
A Kontrollplattform was envisaged before the coast of Sweden, but the project coordinator, of them took far, as the Swedes were little eager to the fact, of human beings to a Russia public on permanent kind and way on level of their coasts.
Schliessen a wreck in the case to the Gasdurchlass in less than one minute, more specific at Mr Miller.
In cases of leaks that the gas is slowing in the Gasfernleitung, therefore are built for the air;
This case however seen of the allow designers and only little, probably because the Schweinähte on a consistency of a spill per 100, 000 years estimated.
The public monitoring of Gasfernleitung will be guaranteed for only of a Unterwasser-Roboter, of external Observationszwecken of a thus preventing sea-going is managed in circulation, as well of a device, in Inner, the Gasfernleitung.
That it has the form of a cigars with a metre diameter will 's position in the home of pipeline is imported and the might mention.
Following three full days of walking by the management in speed of 3 metres per second, the equipment when arrival provides most to the information on possible Deformationen of metal.
The Gasfernleitung was designed to make to function of 50 years, not even just to be subject of least repairs.
The Gaszirkulation guarantees very simply by pressure..

Five societies have united on the implementation of this project to their forces. this is nothing
The Leitungsführung remains in the hands of Gazprom, which is 51% of shares.
Still we are affiliated here of the German societies feel Italian-based, and BASF, and as the Dutch Gasunie and the French Firmengruppe GDF Suez.

Gazprom will have to pay the overall capacity for no matter, as do the real transportiere volume, clearly has just stated at Mr Miller.
The financing of Gasfernleitungsbaus has covered to 30% of shareholders and 70% by loans granted by financial and
The whole cost of labour should amount to 7.4 billion for both pipe.

The provisions are however in itself to attract gewi, their expenses again, because, bears Gazprom, the risk of liability has been only;
The Gasfernleitung enters on a sandy, pine leaving behind forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.

Since last Tuesday, this terminal will supply with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per verstreichende hour.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million to 2012. year
