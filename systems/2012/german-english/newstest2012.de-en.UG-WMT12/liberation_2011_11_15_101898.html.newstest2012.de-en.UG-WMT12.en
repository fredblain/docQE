Energy policies:
The facts will prevail on dogmas
Does a subject that not treated to grassroots of short-term considerations or due emotions, it is this certainly of energy policy.
Availability and the expense to influence directly of electricity Mae of the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the enterprises;
It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen on Anlasse, thinking on this issue and the position of the nuclear energy..
The debate only to bear fruits, if they are the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the options.
The Frenchman should they think to have an objective evidence, the rational data fundieren;
Although itself, there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution that drives forward to a doubling of the Elektrizitätsnachfrage by years in 2050, should not have to abandon a huge share of the world 's population to a vital element.
Also we must alleviate the shortage, the fossil resources, so still consistently produce electricity without the urgent necessity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to forget to a subject verschwundenes from the environmental debate, so against climatic Unregelmäigkeiten when, as
The accidents of Fukushima change not of this parameter..
That is why Germany blebt to isolate still in its decision, to give up on nuclear power..
That this is intended not of the case in Belgium, that is surrendering its decision, the need, to find a substitutionsfähige Ersatzquelle, still in the Switzerland, which just ever more frequent; only to build nuclear plants of the last generation.
Grobritannien, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Holland, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, so to name just to some states, are following their projects but will continue with determination.
The United States for its part decision after Fukushima, they have been channelled to a new unity, by they are taking after the nuclear accident, redundant work Three Mile Iceland, once again in operating this Park..
Also if this renewable sources, along, the German model on occasions as a model, based on the one hand and so goes against the reality to the discourse.
The elections in Berlin will be addressing in the form of prices of the Elektrizitätspreises, a detriment of energy dependence in particular Russia of closer by the high use on Importgas, an increase in the carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power stations niederschlagen..
The entirety that this unfortunate effects will do already within the course of a few months to impact.
The case, Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is in part of European Tabellenführer on wind energy from it is 30% of its electricity, on the other hand of the country is used to be one of the most users of coal and gas, it in turns to put up with wind energy; Aufgrunddessen, its CO2-Ausstösse and its Elektrizitätspreis respectively about 65% and 50% higher than the appropriate European average.
The consistency of energy policy of our neighbours pay a budgets to French in the other hand to our 40% of higher Elektrizitätsrechnung;
Given the price of the global economy to a key role, which represents of the competitiveness and a Stabilitätspfand of the industry on national soil, the französichen companies have given the most favourable electricity in Europe is a advantage
Any significant reduction on nuclear power and therefore to draw a strong increase in Energiepreises for itself, what the noble statement on the Council to channel these remaining funds that will, in our countries and the defence of purchasing power on illusion liesse. in writing
The surveys showed, for which is a price, is prepared as little to pay the groe majority of French, how it demonstrates to resist against the principle of this energy source.
Remember we to us, that the energy of our country has made it possible, develop a industry with 125.00 jobs inferred of direct and 410.000:
Their strong Exportcharakters does it a whole host specialised small and medium-sized company on the international markets and makes these jobs to the architects of countless, something
Take France of the decision, from the nuclear power to leave as being spoilt where to fall a Groteil of these SME victim, and the annual 6 billions were EUR on Investitionsgüter- and Kernenergieexport and more, one being
Which take electricians to entrust a EPR developed on functioning on 60 years, when the decline is inevitable of its producers?
Give to resolve to the energy of the equation, we and the fact that it is also little such as a is the work of the devil, a panacea for production of electricity.
The developing out of the Areva company; low-carbon solutions for use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the Komplementarität of energy sources
Is to maintain the highest possible level of safety for the nuclear power is a absolute imperative.
In France we have a safety authority, the uncompromising and transparent control in existing works as the construction in Flamanville.
Their Arbeitsteams, who have made a name because their professionalism, enough of the Sicherheitsvorstellung it is precisely too.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry was three of serious accidents -
Only a single, namely in Three Mile Iceland, is supported in normal operating conditions; as he was without the consequences for people and the environment:
In the Chernobyl disaster, the tragedy was created by Reaktorkonstruktion and unendschuldbares, human failure..
When Fukushima seems some forgetting, and that the accident of two natural disasters has never seen before either Ausmasses has been caused, which causes the deaths of several tens of people.
The nuclear industry to draw their lessons also from this accident, how they have done after the two previous, this of them.
Is a fruit to this approach and a cooperation of safety authorities to the French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power stations, the EPR to draw up a draft, the resistance towards this phenomena;
Because it considers as desirable in the Elektrotechnikern building, a nuclear power station, and so an ending in Flamanville would be a fabelhaftes gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, by one liesse free rail to give them, reissen the leadership in the inevitable Kernkraftentwicklung in itself..
It is absolutely essential and legitimate to seek for the best Energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible of emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber that dominate considerations have a debate to allow the equally economic, social and financial situation of country.
