The general meeting aims to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate.
Almost five months for the Czech football is no chairman and this risk that the successor of Ivan Hasek on the tip of the Czech Football Association, not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk, will be known.
To this day: there still is no agreement on elected after any electoral rules.
And this is not to the vote on the three potential successor is possible.
The three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík.
Trat June Hasek of returning its role, calling his colleague in like to do and has had to find a strong personality to agree itself and that the guided football in the future to the..
Only in the era that Hasek broke the old squabbles between the two Verbandskammern are once again the agreement on a common candidates.
That proved klipp and clear on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the general meetings came quite for nothing into Volkshaus in Prague quarter Smíchov, the negotiation that led to no result and this was not only about the election itself
It namely could sometimes about agree who is actually entitled to in the Vollsammlung - civil servants, only the statutory representatives or the budget with a power also;
In this one point, reached it at least partially to agree, and to soften the recommendation of institute for state and justice, also, whose opinion was not permissible for a representation on Vollmachtbasis, the case.
The disputes at the electoral rules take however to continue.
The executive committee expressed not more clarity in the matter, in its meetings in principle, it is more the agenda at nothing else; no matter whether proper or extraordinary
Also if the views in terms that the election is reorganizing a few time - the key point was the same;
The question reads: How to proceed in the third round, to so avoid a stalemate?
The bone of contention concerns the question, whether we should proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model to be found, was to note Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FACR, represents in the management to the Profi-Fußball.
The satzungsmäßigem model takes a candidate in the third round anyone candidate, the greater prozentuelle support is given in the chamber, for he.
Moravia is supposedly prepared to respond on the compromise that the person who takes a candidate, the higher number of votes is given from two chambers.
The Czech side in turn insists on the condition, the fact that the winner in this prozentuellen count at least receives a two-thirds.
Then to the two Vorrunden, have any point more, this modus would put the whole Zweikammerkonzept in question, understands not to angle events in Svoboda 's objections of the Moravian side, which it would find best of the electoral rules, but too choose under valid statutes.
Surprisingly the is voting on forward, even Tomás Paclík, even though emerging, for the with the nature of statutory electoral law of all candidates most think Pelta is
My wish is that it will be as far as possible, elected to do so under the statutes it:
Themselves abgrenzte that not absurd Ersatzvarianten will come out of his head is standing, as with the last general meeting, the owner said Victoria Plzen, the idea for the first time in his opinions before all Pelta and is taking towards it.
Pelta remains however optimistic;
Its opinion that the new chairman is aware in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates are going to cooperate in the future also constructively.
The possible qualification of national team for the Euro today day would contribute sure to the minds..
If the football, only on the euphoric wave ride them will also have the willingness on cooperation, which is greater, believes the official from Jablonec, the playing of the main experience of all three Adepten and this not only on professional, and regional level
Rajchl is there of moderate.
I look forward to an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately hypocritical.
It is not on the matter between the people from their homes in Bohemia and Moravia, but There are certain efforts, baseline figures, the rules on own purposes.
Is therefore not excluded to a fresh deadlock in the general meetings.
However, that ultimately win the healthy sense, I hope, who said Rajchl, and
But remains a lot of time for agreement of all sides - not more.
Some negotiations should become the horror supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows, whether the, will be absolutely complete, for Fußballgeneralität to Qualifikationsspiel, and for
To the Charterflugzeug, flying with the other Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, after Podgorice should have been in the morning in Prague for a technical disruption at all in order to launch, and so wanted it urgently after a Ersatzvariante, how bringing it is a part of the Executive Committee after the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels..
Ultimately then after I think, the meeting at ministerial level is crucial, which it should come supposedly on Wednesday, and it
Have been, the ministers for schools, youth and body as Dobes, the double parties within the greatest Sportverbands of the country like an agreement is moving.
Indeed it is a lot on the game. state benefits, of the Vertrauungswürdigkeit 'meeting of the Czech football and that the forthcoming is also the CSTV, which in the Czech sport is forward after the financial problems of Sazka to the new direction.
Paclík is in the fight to position of the chairman, because it had not appropriate candidates of the matter is
When Tomás Paclík, the leader of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting to a strong candidate would be able, which represent, it meets all its ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic of the way, would have been not entered into it is absolutely on the fight about these leaders.
If there were a good candidates, then, I would fight to abandon for it and to vote. this
But in the current situation has managed it not, to find such a Adepten, said Paclík CTK.
Is the main reason for Paclík, going to set international with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl, is to reach it is therefore to prevent that the alleged favourites of election, Pelta on the tip of the FACR..
Paclík is also emphasised that it will exercise the role of the chairman is only a year in the case of his victory does, by 2013, to the date of the proper general meetings.
In the position by the Chairman, he should like been to have seen a never get to know Top-Manager, of not too much, is else in the Fußballgeschehen, and
With some people coming in question, I was spoken personally;
Little to believe, that I have some said, wanted itself does not identify it currently with the Czech football.
Such views to change like the time, led you want to it.
On most of all Paclík, allegedly disrupting the link Pelta 's with the chairman of the Pilsner Bezirksfußballverbands, Roman Berbr, a man with controversial reputation, is short of the scenes than powerful lobbyist, with the ability, to have an impact Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta, the position of chairman.
In his victory, the current situation would forward einkonserviert in Czech football, first of all were:
The support by Berbr, would get a reply, a cleverem Businessman of the football is doubly badly, emphasised Paclík..
Plays it also in this important, that Pelta 's name before some time in connection with Telefonabhörungen was identifying in a Korruptionsaffaire, emerged however unpunished from the Pelta..
I do not know which prestige a victory out by Pelta where football to table.
And what would we stand was said selling the observations of UEFA and FIFA in the view, rekl Paclík, whom shall its previous words, it the Pilsner Fußballklub, when Pelta chairman will however have been somewhat calmly.
Prevail Paclík in the Donnerstagwahl and could themselves present it however to a future cooperation with Pelta is entirely.
Also think including another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the general meeting in October supports, which was a fiasco..
He is first to whom I would go.
That he has made a great skills..
I imagine me his good example as leader of national team.
But I do not believe that it is able to lead the association as managers.
I is not to my nose, but in matters, of which I not understand, said Paclík, and the was made in September, for all it believe that he was behind the Abberufung of Schiedsrichterkommission with Ludek Macela on the top, the Dagmar Damková, it replaces.
Paclík claims even that he is the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden.
And here on his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, remarking it is also to head of Pilsen, which was the first triumph with its support in May in League.
I have to contribute to change the power, somewhat in Fußballmilieu and too a certain cultivation of this..
To limit the influence of certain stakeholders, which have a tendency to influence disciplinary and Berufungskommissionen which entails bis in front situations, led in Paclík, of no secret from its antipathy towards the example towards the Sparta-Chef, Daniel Kretínský makes
And one of its priorities, it would address the consolidation of relations between the FACR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee, with its aid in the political leaders for that it would lobbyieren, that more money from the Lotteriesteuer in the sport goes.
This is one of the crucial things which is, it should pay, the new chairman..
When it comes to taxation Glückspielen, how the political parties declare that, then can understand I to their arguments, then, but it must tell also klipp, and clearly where the money are concerned, said he will be provided;
Its link to the Pilsner is not given to a club in the Paclík, also as a handicap, even though it even stresses the chairman of the FACR must, though, and
Pelta turn is linked with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
It is not just the ideal:
It is not in my opinion but also much sense, my shares in Pilsner, transferring a club is hypocritical on a Drittperson in order to return again after 18 months, asked Paclík clear
Pelta promised new statute of the FACR, the future ausschlössen a stalemate;
Two days ago, the general meeting of Football Association promised one of the candidate for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely, Miroslav Pelta, he will make much in the case on his election for I greatly enjoyed drawing up this report; that the FACR of new Statute gets the involve sanctions to generate disagreement on the electoral law of the outset in the future..
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Donnerstagsverhandlung in Nymburk and believes the election campaign will defuse sure in a possible success of the Czech choices.
Pelta was promised even before the actual election in September, he wanted to focus in the case of his choice on the national team and the collection of financial resources.
First on the very last moment, is to participate in the election before the last general meetings and so it was perhaps to help the two-month break, presenting to defend its thinking on the leadership of the football and a broader context. this meat is
People to all levels are devoting the football, they are impatiently, and expect therefore that the chairman is known on tomorrow.
It feels that high time, and that the association of someone is led, about the man who is especially with the Jablonecer club, but was also many when Sparta and executive committee years.
Also why it believes that he have sufficient experience do make to be leading the Czech football, and
He is certain that it is the euphoria responsibility for the current problems with the election, which was a time of Ivan Hasek.
Unfortunately adopted in the general meetings in June 'statutes, which were not as completely, as it were all to be accepted -
If it does not allow different interpretations, we would have this September have a chairman, felt Pelta;
The revision of main document, the Bürgervereinigung used it as bait for the delegate.
That I should be the chairman, then I take me to this personal and prepared to bear personal responsibility, if it do not work.
This is a fundamental matter, without which it will be, says Pelta for.
In finally trying it, is to delimit towards its sides.
Previously announced it, he could imagine a cooperation with Jindrich Rajchl, which he recognises because its legal education and it well know that its Gegenkandidat would be his first deputy.
Also Tomás Paclík intervened to it for a long time, not more, the case in turn was no dry to have picked up where it left off on Pelta.
In football, it moves already on a year and can already be some success, and that is
Its attacks were shocking but herabsetzend and that a lot of people were of its campaign.
And therefore to doubt now many to his real nature, addressed Pelta on his opponent, the well remain to be true to its Proklamierungen, which he already have expressed in September..
He thinks that its strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest divisions, and even to the national team.
And should the advertisement of the Czech football -
I would like to make also therefore, to stop everyone Affairen - of the Causa Bohemians, and on the Nachhallen of the Korruptionsskandals by last year.
Equally after I would, I would bring to negotiate with the private companies and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football, said to the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK before two months.
Then also; he promised that his introduction in the tip of the Czech football means no human cleansing.
I should make only once to familiarise with the Arbeitsinhalt of all employees, he said to Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness, because the long anarchy.
Despite dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, the forthcoming general meetings of vote, it believes that the delegates on Thursday are not for nothing, after Nymburk will go, and we
When really should the only controversial point as we will choose in the third round, then we come the fact across it.
The football needs back of credibility and which it is becoming the only way, if it has finally to come up with a new Leader, remains Pelta that there are two days before the, possibly crucial day of its Funktionärskarriere to be optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FACR under beginning is to work his firm
That when the previous deputy chairman Jindrich Rajchl on the general meeting on Thursday on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech republic, should be elected, it would vermiesen this alleged many people in association of the whim, it is
Rajchl is promised, the fact that we work hard in the case of his choice will start.
It will make system changes to introduce the members of the executive boards for individual Fußballbereiche responsibility.
Also, he promised to resolve the case Bohemians, improving the relationship to the UEFA and FIFA, continuing to bring more money in the football and otherwise the work, the previous chair Ivan Hasek has started.
As the Chairman, I will devote the football as a whole.
Starting by the international contact to the UEFA and FIFA, about the Nationalauswahl to the professional football, including on Leistungsfußball for the young people.
I will not say that, for its purpose alone, I everything; he said Rajchl in talks for CTK.
I am distributing a Teamspieler and would therefore like the powers in executive committee as the fact that each member is devoting a certain area.
And distribute hard tasks, so that the football in every segment with Meilenschritten progress
We were many not just delighted, because they, should start, and not only to criticise the work of others, even to work really hard now, when he added to add it..
Given the critical atmosphere in Fußballbewegung to be drawn in recital, at no longer to stand;
I is aware that I am working 20 hours on day.
But I must be aware, that there is the point and that people behind me, which I pose not, muzzling a stick between the ground and any step, I make to stand to provide in question, he said, as a statement, why he was hesitated.
Many people have said I, that I should not give up, because it would be done also otherwise to others.
This is confidence that we must not forfeit, he said.
Claim also motivate, dürfen the work to continue, which it has begun under Hasek.
There are two years, we have to tackle a major piece of work and this will not throw away, I now is -
Have been launched to see stop processes, which may come only in a few years and I apply to be very reluctant, that they people, thought it, and bring now its concerns on an expression that the case for that would be elected - Miroslav Pelta of the other candidate, the situation in the times before Hasek is returning.
I believe that in systematic approach and it is a little, which Mirek Pelta not brings.
Behind him, there are above all people, which would make football, as the fact that he is only more for a chosen here.
I accuse it some, but that I would be biased.
I try me, objectively to sein;
Let me in football for all, because it goes all it well and is not only the select, said Rajchl.
It contradicts also of the assertion, he is just a chairman of the Czechs.
Also if say some people to the opposite, I have to propose to do really to the best possible result for Moravia, and has, in some countries, even been reduced;
For example, it is the time to consider whether we should separate the League not in a Czech and a Moravian part, the winner then respectively in the first League aufstiegen. their
It could not happen it, that this three think Moravian clubs in the League play, which particularly is for the young players in Moravia, a problem, about Rajchl.
Because now also, the head of Pilsner club Tomás Paclík, the fight about the role of the chairman is supported, do the authorities hesitate itself not Rajchl, assess its opportunities, and that he is elected.
I feel, a strong support in the Czech chamber, which is elected on her deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes behind my, has led Rajchl, also considers the saving of many tens of million crowns for unfortunate treaties, Fernsehverträgen and negotiations To the Lotteriegesetz as its success to the agreement of it.
Furthermore, it gives itself on part of the fault for the association on a single line, which has not one:
While it of Pelta states, he is disqualified from a priori, is to help the Czech football to new confidence, does it to the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate, the idea was offering the football really somewhat, of
Nobody to ask questions, the fact that it has done in Pilsen of the outstanding only one year work.
It should elect, then, it may continue the things, the Ivan Hasek has taken as well, would not change to the human occupation in the commissions that he obviously fundamentally;
He altered just the situation certainly not on his favour, expresses the Rajchl on its rivals.
