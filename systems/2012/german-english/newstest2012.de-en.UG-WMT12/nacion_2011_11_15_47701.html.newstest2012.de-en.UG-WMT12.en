More than 20 years to expect it, but the band that it is a dream, if it plays in Costa Rica.

The bond finds in the American part of their tour to the ceremony of their 20 - year existence and, on Sunday 20, make its single stop in Central America.

You read an extract to obtain them from the discussion, whose has found full copy in the Online-Ausgabe of La Nación.
On your costaricanischen fans realised in itself, a dream if Pearl plays in Costa Rica Jam. are aware, are you yourselves what means that for your fans?
Implemented to playing in Costa Rica, a dream, also for us.
It just has the second time that we play in South and Central America, and by now there is great.
I have had only once on holidays in Mr Costa Rica. it is such a beautiful country that we will be allowed to be certainly few days there, or a few.
For us, it is exciting to bring our music there towards the day before.
I would ask you that, because the fans of the band are completely shown. you are witnessing the day before the concert to make..
What says their supporters begeistertesten wo?
Thank you to all these years in our side.
We have needed almost 21 years, until we have come after Costa Rica, thank you, is so long to wait to haben it are sorry, this long time are needed, and we are here come.
Some people are even of the opinion, that your concert will most to get the year.
Is that not a little pressure from your visit?
Some greatest, entertainment shows and programmes, who we have got off in the last 21 years, were instead in the last two weeks.
We have to hope to a few Riesenshows in Sao Paulo has played we, that us have made this concert in Costa Rica to prepare of the market;
Really, we wish there play
We like this country, we surf like and are enthusiastic about the jungle.. this Costa Rica is to the best countries, the world
How you experienced her of Costa Rica and its waves on surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend, live in Tamarindo, where the waves just inconceivable.
That my friends travelled always to surfing for Costa Rica and Nicaragua, with Mexico that the excellent areas are for surfing. on these ways, on people, love the surfing that we have to know of them;
With one glance to the tour to their Riesenshows need with many Liedern.
What have espoused of plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we, have played never there still, we are also not;
We are going to try to give, the best possible show with many different Liedern, do we offer a few Songs from each album and our fans is a good, and versatile repertoire.
That it reflects your repertoire never.
They have been able to do so
I believe we could, which is partly so because we have the nine records to play, and 120 songs. all like another song and the decision, will play each hand, easily not.
When we aufnehmen two or three Songs, which we have played already longer, not more, into our repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and surprise us because they are calling the reasons to remind us, why us, these Songs fell, it otherwise they could have ended up to be the ` forgotten man 'in this information;
It makes to the show that is attractive for us and I think therefore also for the audience.
With that tour is celebrating their history twenty-year-old your and
If it looks back, it falls to believe you seriously to your own success?
Total is in fact, of migration;
I think firstly, that no one is put forward of us, even in a great rock band, playing and this also still long 20 years. this effect as dream:
We are putting to continue on this blessing and think it that great, also make now even together of Music.
We can argue us are enthusiastically from music of producing.
We have to drive fortunately to the places of the world, which we wanted to visit always even already..
The things can not be standing better..
What it has meant for you, who is actively in the birth of Grunge?
There is a honour, of belonging great band to this group.
Our friends well with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice, in Chains.
That it is surprising and very unusual if a movement from a group of friends is evident.
And again are a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups, at the same time from the same city brings.
Is where we have honoured proud, and to our own devices, part to the Seattle-Gruppe to sein.
Sometimes we play always more.
Last year, were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden to their tour, we welcome us, is still not friendly with them all and that honours us sein part of this arisen Seattle-Sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band zusammengeblieben to the with such same musicians such for a long time. - in
All four of us, are playing for 21 years and Matt was against legislation thirteen years ago to limit the preparation for enlargement: that alone already is much more time, and survive many band..
Firstly I believe is that we appreciate all happy to us, even on life to sein, and also we look after us about each other.
We all are close friend, why the musical ways are opened, which give any detail to the freedom on experiments.
A familiar one music and its.. it could not go to us better.
Your relationship to the glory is been that are not always easy. on the other hand, her konntet make to thank your success always that, as it wanted, and
How will it strike a balance?
The way we have developed, which has done us simple; to find a balance.
We are safe, do not sein too often on tour, because it is too easy, this game with huge is a source of inspiration for millions, who love your music to sink into it.
As long as one to point to think that the people, because the music, you remember this fact that you ensure, of the music and the terms it has set into lives, without this crazy sein sein a famous Rockstar. that interests are already never -
What never have to remember you in your other project, Mother Love Bone? yes
I believe, we have very good Songs and too early it was great.
We were three years long, a band which had issued by the death of Andy, never a record of the European communities;
We have disappointed so far are needed to haben. do we, a friend is still well with Bruce and Greg, who were building the band with us, for this. when I understand a song or the photographs do, I think, what, for an incredible human Andy, and as it I expressed the laughter: that it was always a pleasure, going to talk together to problems, and on music and football, and many other issues.
That he was an extraordinary individual and we are lacking it.
The domestic volume las Robertas, are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is true, that you know their work, in particular Eddie Vedder, and the bond for the opening choice? 'he
Indeed, the production moved us is causing by several groups, and this volume did us most.. that is why we are curious about the legal expenses, which are to see and what read Robertas on live can offer.. it is certainly exciting.
Why to change it, the text of Yellow Ledbetter, when its live playing?
This is one question for Ed, I voted no idea.
He sings, and I believe that he sings the first to him like.
By whom you affects as Bassist?
On the First, which I einfallen, including Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, and C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, and Chuck Dukowski
It has fallen so many that my entire afternoon on the Bassisten, which I am, to talk the Commission
How it was managed to Pearl Jam, as to keep the Grunge on life, even though it is no longer about a fashion phenomenon?
I believe, we all feel not grateful with the word Grunge.
When I am reflecting me are the band, which I first mentioned for Mudhoney, Soundgarden everyone Nirvana, and the arising same time to it. if they, are also still important, I think this great, because it is worth hearing this music and bands as Mudhoney account now better music as the earlier.
Initially their music was darker, now it is more positive..
They have been able to do so
That it is interesting because I believe there is a few Songs on the new album, the something could work lightly.. but there are also other songs as of the End, or just Breathe, which will be classified as very dark Songs, although they also somewhat positive in itself have the year
On two, I had the tears, when I was listening as Ed, they played, it are very at the same time as dark Songs;
I believe, if you will longer and more drastic in your life happens it are your artistic creation, and your music, and these two Songs it clearly supported me, for example, when one loses a families or a friend
I am also of the view that we can make a happy person and yet some dark music..
