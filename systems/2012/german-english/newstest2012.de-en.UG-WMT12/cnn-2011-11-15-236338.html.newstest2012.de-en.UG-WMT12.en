Urgent warnings, from the Pentagon, from possible cuts in defence
Defence Minister Leon Panetta heizte the Congress Monday, and warned it not that automatic budget cuts would weaken the national security by stealth. that he was a financial spiral of the halls of the Pentagons to the same way in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon already durchdenkt cuts in the level of $450 trillion in the course of the next decade, fears now that further cuts at will the creation of 600 billion dollars or more is necessary, if the Congress can achieve to conclude in the expenditure not..
The effects of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry, wrote Panetta in a letter on the Republican senators of John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey, with Graham, South Carolina.
He said, is a failure of the Congress in achieving a Budgetvereinbarung, what will lead to a so-called seizure, which would lead to 23% of overall cuts and a halt of many new projects.
So a high reduction, carried out, and on such a thoughtless kind and way of the majority of our ship, you can not to remind a ship or a building - and other much in relation, severely, wrote Panetta, the Senators, by and construction projects make unworkable
We had forced in addition, separating us involuntarily of a large part of our civilian personnel, and because the reduction to be implemented so quickly, should beurlauben we on security almost probably civilian, so können the objective to achieve..
Such amendments to destroy the faith which, by our military, received and of our preparedness, damaging serious, and I
The cuts in the end will take the combat troops, said Panetta.
And the Kriegszeitkontingente in fight against terrorism has not affected by the seizure directly, of the serious intervention in the Grundbudget influence of the Kriegsbemühungen is detrimental, Myanmar Panetta.
The recruiting process were the unjustifiable or which will be cut to the delays in the attitudes of the Einstellungsaufsicht, who are supporting the war, are introducing in the system;
The salaries of the personnel reduced, what leads on late payments at Kriegszeithändler and the legal and political support would be disrupted.
The two senators answered Panetta before 10 days ago and asked to make further details on the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of it.
The consequences of a seizure Defence Ministry would begin to achieve a more rapid decline of the leading military global United States as it.
We are strongly to combat this draconian act, told the senators in a joint declaration on Monday, did to a time when published Panettas letter sent it.
This is a final outcome, with whom we can not live, certainly, and it is neither how we are if our backs:
The seizure is not to allow a threat to the national interests of the United Statten and their commitment should:
Whether Panettas letter and new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise will increase in budget or demands, will provide a further boost to the Pentagon of cuts to exclude, it remains to be seen.
Panetta is increasingly bluntly spoken of the possible cuts, even though it need to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and white House, before he was the tip of the Pentagons, and I know that he stands to the grave decisions.
At a press conference, in the last week of defence ministers malte a gloomy picture, what are not over yet - a military forces with skin, but without heart.
There is a ship without seamen in Karachi.
There is a brigade without ammunition, the
There is a Luftwaffengeschwader, without sufficiently trained pilots.
There is a paper to meet an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficient trained soldiers, which are in the situation, the mission said Panetta in its initial report in the Pentagon.
There is a force, which it is lacking on morality and alert and the failure in the situation is to include it with potential opponents.
That you can be a really angry;
Led in an annex to his letters on McCain and Graham Panetta of the new detail, as reductions of significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our global operational and Eingreiffähigkeit what leads a unacceptable risk in future Kriegsoperationen.
And Panetta have said that a number of the greatest Verteidigungsprojekte to delete the victim could fall itself befinden in the economy; including those who have been tested already and already in the early planning stage.
This list also of the fighter pilots F35, the joint Strike part Fighter, a planned new Bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new Bodenkampffahrzeug, the Army and navy need to be replaced in the Humvee;
It would halt it the further development and the tests of the F35 would save it in the next 10 years, up to $80 billion, but that its supporters are saying that it is an important next step towards arms, so that potential dangers arising of China and other opponents are still exposed.
