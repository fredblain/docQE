Of the Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details on the aircraft accident, in which the Regierungssekretär of Francisco Blake and those seven further have lost their lives, know
To the Secretaría, de Comunicaciones y transport agent, - SCT of Health informed that the research on the accident, in which the Regierungssekretär of Francisco Blake came district of Mora and those seven other died attention that the absolutely had some with its whole unversehrten structure directly against the soil, that the pilot would have a emergency evacuation to start without..
Whether Jácome and Secretary for Communication and the transport Pérez Dionisio referred in a press conference, the weather that the pilot would have confirmed before the launch fit for the flight.
The situation that the Propellerflügel in 25 metre level contact, with trees, with the helicopters of the hulls lost, it seems to point out that the had had the helicopters for several Bodenkontakte.
Also, that of the helicopters was built for 19 passengers, why he meets all the requirements for the transport staff met. he said
Also said that the investigations on the area on which the machine shabby, no Hubschrauberteile found..
In the research, does not allow any found aircraft parts in other posts, the extra concerns of the whole structure - that
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, why he meets all the requirements for the passenger transport, moreover.
The area contains a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently it is the priority, getting the findings as soon as possible, but could they, several months, perhaps a year is continuing -
For its part Gilberto López Meyer assured that directors-general of Aeropuertos and Servicios Auxiliares, the fact that the helicopters was the Estado Mayor Presidencial, flew the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit, and the aircraft on a soft Abhang has to do so.
This information that strengthens the adoption that it was on time of the force about a normal Flugoperation.
In a press conference, one on the heads of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, the six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation.
Has:
In line to the Flugnormen, it was about a flight after the rules of the Sichtflugs. it means, is that the team have had to be used during the flight and ground view are sufficient should be
Weather conditions:
The AICM has grown appropriate weather conditions in start; during the Weiterflugs when lines on the border area between Mexico City, and the Mexiko-Staat went to some deeply if we were to take at that altitude;
Chosen routes:
It is possible that the team because the clouds is a lower area with better terms had selected in the direction to the Cuernavaca-Tal.
Aufprallstelle:
The Aufprallkoordinaten of law and that the last Radaraufzeichnung of Hubschraubers will vote. possibly it have been before the impact not one Kontrollverlust on the plane still, an exception of the very route taken.
Verstreuung of remnants to the aircraft in a limited area:
The show out on the moment information to point that the was aufgeprallt helicopters from gerader and seitlicher direction.
The pattern of disparate Flugzeugreste to let that the helicopters with its unversehrten structure on the soil aufgeprallt.
No evidence on fire or explosion:
The legacy of aircraft, provide on accident sites to let either on a fire or explosion:
The last inquiry show out several Bodenkontakte.
In the studies, before local aircraft parts found on a level of 9200 to get a foot on the sea level. the site does on abschüssig and stresses a Schrägung of seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which the helicopter is gone, probably to breaking.
A few information show to point that the had helicopters several Bodenkontakte -
Following a minuziösen research to an area, which went further than the abgesperrten area on the scene, could be found not to combine aircraft parts, which the adoption strengthened, that unversehrte Flugzeugstruktur was absolutely against the soil.
