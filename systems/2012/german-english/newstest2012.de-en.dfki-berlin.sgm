<seg id="1">Experts; claim - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the initial article , learn how Stylisten , I always had a little bit that this was a bit too much fuel for the beginning . </seg>
<seg id="3">I was not in the slightest , which still is . </seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures of three professionals in the industry , the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the " in the square " . </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But even when there is of course any on Saturdays and Sundays , he is nevertheless fully . </seg>
<seg id="8">This time , we debated with Director Alena (on course is not a single man), as a woman , which has no ideal proportionierte figure . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And most of us . </seg>
<seg id="10">Have a short neck and the other to a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig . </seg>
<seg id="11">It is a matter for the Stylisten , broad shoulders look to conceal , conjuring up the neck or the necessary graphs . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got tips on how to Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - therefore , with great bosom , a hip and narrow their - nicely and attracts figurbetont , without fulfill--even too provocative . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If , for example , the difference between their and hips is so great that the rock or the trousers really does not suit , it should at least a piece of clothed; groups . </seg>
<seg id="14">This will certainly be not regret , because good clothes is simply unaffordable . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made Rock you feel are much better than in a , the high and verrutscht , in the course of their absteht , etc . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Jungenhafte figures can afford , in turn , clothing with wrinkles , construction , applications , lace or to take Raffung . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">For this amount of information and Figurtypen I am glad that I have a whole week time to let me go through the Oxfam-International everything thoroughly . </seg>
<seg id="18">And yet , I fear , not to create it is given the task assigned House almost . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">All the participants were given a Promi , for which they should devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe . </seg>
<seg id="20">We are the current appearance , the Modestil of the corresponding stars and its Figurtyp on board . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">To Miranda Kerr " , " that you may be from the campaign ' know Victoria 's Secret . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Within juble I , because it is much better for me personally , as , for example , Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera , the last time on the hundred kilos has increased (oh well , this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet , state and then deal with graphically . </seg>
<seg id="24">In the ' Moodboard ' , as the whole result is known , is our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is very important to consider the graphic side of the Stylings too . </seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist attracts the model not only physically , but is also known as the product side in the journalist (after concrete , for example , Trend-Handtaschen coats , etc .). </seg>
<seg id="27">Full-status told us of the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník . </seg>
<seg id="28">But the only on Sunday . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">That means that must have a Stylist a good overview . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The figures with information on type-approval angefüllte Saturday speech was peppered from three visitors from the industry: </seg>
<seg id="31">The Stylisten Jan Pokorný , from fashion designers Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben . . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this . </seg>
<seg id="33">And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way . </seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word means variability . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So you can take , for example , a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans , a T-shirt or coat , you can have it but also on the naked body , subparagraph shoes to attract and take it as a dress . </seg>
<seg id="36">Enough is enough , or roll up our sleeves and get to see from the whole look very different . </seg>
<seg id="37"> " Others-plays , " he said . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most came to me but the following Council: " First of all , you have to know the rules perfect . " </seg>
<seg id="39">" Only then you must violate them , " said Jakub . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">It is clear to me why we need to pauken all these theories , which can be combined with what and why , even if you get to see in Modejournalen often quite different . </seg>
<seg id="41">Not to mention fashionable look . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now , that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options , as photographed it . </seg>
<seg id="43">So we need for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared , at least fifteen to stylen . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that the clothing on the photograph in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality . </seg>
<seg id="45">With all of this , so in the design of the attire . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and Styl sometimes make up half of the success , which confirmed a Jan Pokorný as well . </seg>
<seg id="47">Because one needs only to Madonna , not just a brilliant singer , have made the image and marketing a world star . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic is the services of a Stylisten rather reserved . </seg>
<seg id="49">Also doet people often think that this is a wasted money (the main thing is that I bring something , how I turned out is secondary). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if any of us stylen , then we should expect that he or she is very likely a very different (smaller) size than he or she really needs . </seg>
<seg id="51">It needs to be googlen then only to determine with certainty that writes the tabloid press , the Promi have declined to or , etc . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">On Sunday , Jan and Mario Inter-ministerial us not to believe , that we are in Stylist just to focus on the fashion and then the clothes " assemble them " needs . </seg>
<seg id="53">In his work must communicate it , especially with the people who he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist . </seg>
<seg id="54">People think , without curry favor and stick to its opinion . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">" If any of us , a director in order to see their clothes cabinet and to complement fine , we can clear up and say we have the whole cabinet - my God , this is terrible . " </seg>
<seg id="56">" You have to find at least a few worthy things , to which it recommends , what they can contribute , " says Mario . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He showed us in real terms , as a so-called " place pocket; " must include . </seg>
<seg id="58">So a pocket; , the pre-Maastricht in the waists zuknöpft and in the pre-Maastricht all the necessary Proprietäten in . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">No such clear , as gap , Abroller to remove hair or security needles , they also Utensilien , such as a Nylonfaden (it helps the Stylist the photographing of products , such as handbags or avoid), specific clips , which will be tightened up , the clothes , if it is too big Stecknadeln (or other Klemmen are banned , so that is not the substance of) and , of course , Nähzeug . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So we must listen to but not only , but also to try something , we learned , as in we put shoes . </seg>
<seg id="61">Is also in the photography at the courses , where the floor is , it is the Schuhsohle damage , let alone the outside . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">We klebten o and klebten we ... </seg>
<seg id="63">With the gap must be the shoes again , so that they are not damaged . </seg>
<seg id="64">So we must be really well . </seg>
<seg id="65">Mario was me , by my " creation " praised without restrictions . </seg>
<seg id="66">The skill is not just mentioned my strength . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All this was only a fraction of what we did in the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs . </seg>
<seg id="68">One thing is clear to me now - to address the styling at a professional level is not an easy task . </seg>

<seg id="22">In the desert , for example , is surprised by a desert storm , which reduces the point of view . </seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains , in turn , must you need to watch that you will not by an avalanche of being buried . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">By the way are quite good running the individual race . </seg>
<seg id="25">Only a few , but they are . </seg>
<seg id="26">For a while they tried to overtake so , the number of compulsory opponents (in principle) a classic race , then there will be time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expected an even a personal duel with a single opponent . </seg>
<seg id="27">And that also involves himself the police , the whole thing will blow . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A novelty are passages in which Jack out of the car . </seg>
<seg id="29">It is more about certain interactive , in which Jack before anyone is and where he has to help the players in the right moment , the right button . </seg>
<seg id="30">So nothing complicated . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising , however , that there is in the game much less such passages , as one would expect (actually only three). </seg>
<seg id="32">After all , this is to the advantage of rather , because this element at least has no chance of becoming boring - it is in the context of the above--relatively point one of the elements that make the game diversify . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts . </seg>
<seg id="34">This means that from today 's point of view , it is no trees , on the other hand , you could not say that it would be bad . </seg>
<seg id="35">Who realistic simulations , must look elsewhere . </seg>
<seg id="36">But a action; invited Rennfahren meets the European Fahrmodell continue , although could be found in the competition better . </seg>
<seg id="37">Until then , as far as everything is well . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems , only after a certain time . </seg>
<seg id="39">In contrast to the Fahrmodell is not the conflict-of-law model quite OK </seg>
<seg id="40">Of a game of this kind is difficult to expect that it complicated deformations and collisions , but if it has virtually no impact on any object idea , what the car is doing , then obviously not everything is in order . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typical example: the close do or over--and drive to oncoming cars " does " in some of the other car only slightly , in others , almost identical situation is but skidding and is wild performance . </seg>
<seg id="42">Or the Karre to scrap . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the Restart-Systems makes it no more , it is annoying . </seg>
<seg id="44">The rest are resolved as Arts: if you total damage has or is far outside the line , then a the game on the last point . </seg>
<seg id="45">Only - in every race has only five rest Arts . </seg>
<seg id="46">If they have exhausted , all from scratch . </seg>
<seg id="47">The rest are Arts , rather as a tool in the event that is not something that should leave but not on it . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Helps sometimes but not even the Restart , and nothing else , as the critical section to learn from the head . </seg>
<seg id="49">Extremely unpleasant , is that the same things happen often in the same places . </seg>
<seg id="50">Some curves must pass through , for example in a specific way , otherwise it is not easy . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere it in his list " civilian " cars are in the same configuration , whether it be the first and fifth , five seconds sooner or a minute later . </seg>
<seg id="52">It is annoying to see that , particularly in situations of Kontrahent before a romped two oncoming cars are ignored , but until it gets to the cars already in such a position that they must stop or to avoid it . </seg>
<seg id="53">And there is no difference when we arrive , everything is designed so that there is this situation--help close to your nose . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have other benefits . </seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game , there are a few places where you always in the same place the same opponents obsolete , and will be again regardless of the time . </seg>
<seg id="56">The crazy TENs this is at the end of the game on the long bridge , which is in the right direction . </seg>
<seg id="57">The Kontrahent must here seem to overtake come hell or high water . </seg>
<seg id="58">And then , when it is facing a , then of course it makes a point of view , so we will initially other-gender car a couple of times in Klump . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Clear - trying to make the game simply more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clearly , fulfill--even anticipate--a quickly , the joy of account; spoiled . </seg>
<seg id="60">And this is a pity , because despite sold Fahrmodell is the game as a whole rather entertaining and in some places so aktionsgeladen , that almost no longer know , where one of the head . </seg>
<seg id="61">And in principle , no matter what it is - " over-reward " the concept with  unique routes , the organisation of the race in a way that can prevent boredom , or something quite different ... </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the least in the course of the race . </seg>
<seg id="63">We must not overlook the petrol stations on the road , because here you can switch the car , although there is in most cases the car , which has one . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories . </seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are well suited to the urban areas , the strong American brand for the precise motorways and exotic Super-Sportwagen for the technical journeys; , for example , on the Serpentinen in the mountains . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the Aufgaben-Modus (challenges) - the race in the individual premises , we know from history . </seg>
<seg id="67">Here there are not only medals , but also to gain experience for their own profile that together for the tasks (challenges) and history . </seg>
<seg id="68">In order to get to the higher level , drivers must be open to different objects: from the car , to the Backgrounds for the profile . </seg>
<seg id="69">This is linked to the online role Autolog , among others , the own achieved results with those of other players and also for further collective functions . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">One of Schnitzern further incomprehensible is a situation in the last race of the history . </seg>
<seg id="71">Here it is: the car in a passengers; (as), where it is in the dark on the track for desecrate (as). </seg>
<seg id="72">On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km / h (I), but there is suddenly from behind a metro and is a tough to scrap . </seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorial , as well for a long time about whether a blackout in the game makers was or whether to keep the authors is so stupid . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there . </seg>
<seg id="75">Even more galling is that some of Bildwiederholfrequenz exciting times and this sometimes quite dramatic . </seg>
<seg id="76">This is particularly the case for accidents with greater number of concerned , where a continuous FPS nothing good . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound track is taste . </seg>
<seg id="78">In an effort to address a as broad as possible range rather young audience , created a Soundtrack a lá ' by each buy something " - but who is such a game because of the music ? ! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall picture on Need for steroids: The turgidity ? The feelings are more mixed . </seg>
<seg id="80">If the game not by the already-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes , we would have with the held belief that The turgidity is the best piece of NFS in recent years . </seg>
<seg id="81">But so is the game somehow unfinished . </seg>
<seg id="82">To be a pleasure , but we should be prepared that this mistake with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eyes . </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously it takes the motto ' Verständlich and openly about Europe ' , they showed in the first part of their lecture , in which it was , the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe that they so many editor would have the law faculty of the Karlsuniversität can . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">" There has been criticism that he had to quietly - a grey official who is not up to such a role , but I must say that it has " all the time , how well he has taken up the cause . </seg>
<seg id="9">" He is a person who it is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patient; to communicate with them and the particularly clear ideas on how to proceed with the EU . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="30">Mrs Vicenové , expect the EU especially tough rules in the future of far-from-equilibrium budgetary policies more of the member states . </seg>
<seg id="31">As much of that as a " European Federation " is the concept of a Europe of the two , or even different speeds . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">" We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone . </seg>
<seg id="33">" We already have the Schengen area and we have the Institute of Harbor cooperation . " </seg>

<seg id="2">The innovator IBM enters its existence the second century </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">Wanted to look for a suitable word that characterised the strategy of IBM most closely , that would be the word ' longevity . " </seg>
<seg id="4">IBM is a synonym for technological revolution to the general public , it is known as a modern companies , although since its inception a century has passed . </seg>
<seg id="5">The basis of this longevity , already presented its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.W. </seg>
<seg id="6">Already he argued the slogan , countless were easily solve global problems , if the people were prepared to think a little bit . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan " think ! " Has been so for the trademark , for the life of the future giants should (and at the same time to the title of the internal magazine , which , in IBM in 1935). </seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture . </seg>
<seg id="9">" For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future . </seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also an entire century , because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else surrounding it . </seg>
<seg id="11">The allowed us , in the course of our first century , the technologies to transform the business and society . </seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years , " said Samuel J. Palmisano , who is now director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thought-out system </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson was already in the thirties socio-medical its employees - in a similar way , such as the Baa entrepreneurs in Czechoslovakia: the IBM-Leute had as one of the first American workers paid leave , insurance by the entrepreneurs plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a reasonable pay system for best innovators and traders . </seg>
<seg id="15">As more sophisticated are also of IBM long-term relationships with their customers . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was from the outset in the brilliant talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world , on IBM any discrimination - and could decide accordingly . </seg>
<seg id="17">In line with the anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan , will barely-existent the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty . </seg>
<seg id="18">Is already the thirty years with IBM , so far , the position of the Vetriebs- , marketing and strategy leader; . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM makes so-called Online-Brainstormings in recent years , from where many future strategies and innovation . </seg>
<seg id="20">No wonder - ideas there are enough , the company is almost half a million people . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Their unwavering position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and this after within and outside . </seg>
<seg id="23">" From the outset , IBM , the concept of an institution , as a mere technology-producing company , " said the Economist professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM , Rosabeth Moss Kanter . </seg>
<seg id="24">" IBM is not a technology-producing companies , but a company , the business helps solve problems using technology , " added George Colony of Consulting-Firma Forrester Research . </seg>
<seg id="25">As the companies themselves , there is a difference , to be on the market only present or to shape it through this presence directly . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Family called " Big Blue " for their logos IBM - in the States , is one of the largest companies in the world has come in a century . </seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software , infrastructure , hosting and consulting services in a broad product - of servers to nanotechnology . </seg>
<seg id="28">Of all the American technology companies has IBM most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize . </seg>
<seg id="29">To its most famous inventions include , for example , bank machines , credit cards , Finanzswap , bar code or the diskette . </seg>
<seg id="30">With approximately $ 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was IBM in this year 's second largest technology-producing companies (after Apple), and it took for the first time since 1996 , Microsoft . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations , the taste of the customers of today - were unhappy OS for example the attempt with its own operating system / 2 , the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr . </seg>
<seg id="33">' business is based on the forward movement , not tie it emotionell in the past , " said to Samuel J. Palmisano . </seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore has no problem IBM , its foundations to build on various platforms - and if they do not work , they have to leave . </seg>
<seg id="35">In contrast to the opponent Microsoft , with its Windows operating system stands and falls . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit safest assets with a value of $ 15 billion , in the same time , however , $ 58 billion in the future technologies . </seg>
<seg id="40">In these investment continues IBM after 2008 , and saw the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm on the world . </seg>
<seg id="41">Here , too , IBM was faithful to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson , in the midst of the Great Depression its scale . </seg>
<seg id="42">So far , it seems that survives the company IBM today 's crisis unscathed . </seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the IBM-Aktien rose by 120 percent since 2008 raketenartig and the profit of the company productivity--the kontinuell . </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Development of the travel prices since 1989 </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989 there was in the SSR only five approved state travel agents: edok , Sporturist , CKM , Rekrea and Autoturist . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel agents sold at the time , especially only travel in the socialist bloc , in the West were the only chosen . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And so , Czech tourists in the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union in the Crimea peninsula (Sochi on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use it . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Was a silver excep the period from 1962 to 1972 , when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia , then a pro-Western course a proposed Yugoslavia and have therefore been severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A great paradox of socialist times it was the fact that it may not even be citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel within the framework of the socialist countries . </seg>
<seg id="7">If I wanted to travel a citizen of the SSR for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union , then took it to a so-called invitation letter , were not Individualreisen possible . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then , to the travel agents also travel to the West , then had to be huge queues in purchasing or stay in the sleeping bag before the travel agency , or at least " good friends " in the travel agency . </seg>
<seg id="9">Also so the matter was not yet . </seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called currency - the condition for an exit to the West - was only " politically reliable " of people - the other could not travel . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czech currency was not free exchange as currency , foreign exchange , it would have been impossible , so the necessary funding (Western) find currency for a trip to the West . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The way most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home , it is no wonder that bought the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas - a habit that continues to this day . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip to the revolution of the Czechs . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR in Bulgaria or the measure of all things , spent the Czechs last year 4,5 million their holidays abroad in countries around the world . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A huge paradox , which is not at all now , is the fact that , in the most popular holiday country the Czechs - could not travel to Croatia 1989 at all , because it was part of the former Yugoslavia . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the beginning of the 90 s of the last century was lifted in the foreign exchange duty in the neighboring West European countries , which caused a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany . </seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken could not get over a long period of their trips to the West simply enough , everyone wanted to have at least a few days since . </seg>
<seg id="18">So slept the Czech holidaymakers in travel to Paris in the tent in the park , because who would have guessed the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a with canned , beer and sausages , etc . Vollgepackter boot . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades , our tourists buy the Western currency finally free . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and , consequently , the average salaries rose to 1997 , which einmündete in another important moment . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights , which the air travel because of the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts , economy--with compared to the past . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 90 s , the Czechs , with the exception of the United States , already exchange of payment with all advanced countries in the world , making it even easier travel . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of the " post-utopian Velvet ' travel there was in 2000 , when it was Community-cleared thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand . </seg>
<seg id="25">Since then fly direct Charter-Flugzeuge with Czech passengers every year in distant sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic  exotic destinations . </seg>
<seg id="26">Of the 100 Tsd . Czechs travel every year in exotic places ! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another important moment in the era , which our ' post-revolutionary ' development marked , came in 2008 . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Roll on 17 November 2008 , the US visas for Czech tourists , which most definitely our country under the most developed countries of the world . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">More than half of their holidays abroad for the first time in years the Czechs spent 2008 (50,3%) and for the first time in its history peasants-a it for a single Urlaubsaufenthalt including the costs on the destination for more than 15 Tsd . CZK per capita . </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The general meeting is to find a new chairman - again , there is a stalemate . </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months , the Czech football and there is no chairman that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known . </seg>
<seg id="3">Until today , there is still no agreement , after the electoral law . </seg>
<seg id="4">And this is no vote on the three potential successor . </seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June Hašek resigned his role , and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to come together and to find a strong personality , which could lead the football in the future . </seg>
<seg id="7">Only in the era of Hašek , from the old squabbles between the two chambers Association , which are unable to agree on a joint candidate . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This was very clearly on 16 September , should be chosen as the new chairman . </seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the main assembly; euro-egoism free of charge to Public House in Prague Smíchov quarter , because the negotiations led to a result and it was not only about the election itself . </seg>
<seg id="10">We could not agree is about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutes representatives or even with the full power of officials . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point it was at least partly agreement , which also helped the recommendation of the Institute for government and legal , whose opinion is not a representation at full power base . </seg>
<seg id="12">The divergencies in order the electoral law , however , continue to take . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Executive Committee did not bring more clarity in the matter , part-sessions , whether regular or extraordinary - is in principle nothing else on the agenda . </seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the opinions in a couple of times about the election changed - the worst point remained the same . </seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: how do we proceed in the 3 th round , in order to avoid a stalemate ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">" The issue is the question whether or not to be in accordance with the constitution , or whether we need to find a different model , " said Duan Svoboda , one of the three deputy chairman of the ex-FAR , who represents in the management of the professional football . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to a registered model candidate who prevails in the third round of the greater as support in the chamber , for which he stood . </seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is supposedly ready to compromise , that the one candidate prevails , which the higher number of votes from both chambers . </seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side again , on the condition that the winner of this percentage vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">" We have the two Vorrunden make no sense , this method would put the entire two Chamber; concept in question , " Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side , it would be the best , not tweaking the electoral law , but to choose under current rules . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Agrees with surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík , even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="22">" It is my wish that , as far as possible after the statute is elected . " </seg>
<seg id="23">" It could be a nonsensical replacement options , such as at the last general meeting , " said the owner of the (football clubs) Victoria Plzeň , the candidates for the first time and abgrenzte in his opinions in particular Pelta . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta but remains optimistic . </seg>
<seg id="25">His opinion , in Nymburk the new chairman will be known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future . </seg>
<seg id="26">" The possible qualifications of the national team for the Championships today would certainly contribute to calm the emotions . " </seg>
<seg id="27">" If the football until the euphoric wave ride them , then it is also the willingness to cooperate , " the official says Jablonec larger , by all three Adepten the most experience and this is both at a professional , and regional level . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is restrained . </seg>
<seg id="29">" I hope for an agreement , but the situation is unfortunately is ambivalent . " </seg>
<seg id="30">" This is not a matter between the people in Bohemia and Moravia , but there are some efforts , the rules to own purposes " officialdom . " " </seg>
<seg id="31">" That is why a new on the general meeting not excluded . " </seg>
<seg id="32">" However , I hope that common sense prevails in the end , " said Rajchl . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Only - there is not much time to the agreement of all sides left . </seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should be supposedly directly in Montenegro , but who knows , maybe the Fußballgeneralität until its qualification will be completely at all . </seg>
<seg id="35">The charter plane , with the should fly , among other things Dalibor Kuera and Rajchl after Podgorice , was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical problem , and so was urgently for a replacement variant , how to be a part of the executive committee but to the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the end it is surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level , to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday . </seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobe , the minister for education , youth and physical education have divided the parties within the biggest sports ' of the country to an agreement . </seg>
<seg id="38">There is a lot at stake: government grants , the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the ČSTV , the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík in the fight for the position of Chairman , because he sees no suitable candidates </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If Tomáš Paclík , the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate to represent , all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAR) have been met , he would have been not to the fight for the top position . </seg>
<seg id="41">" If there was a good candidate , then I would fight for it and give up on the election . " </seg>
<seg id="42">" But in the current situation , we did not succeed in such a Adepten to find , " said Paclík ČTK . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for Paclík , into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl to go , it is to prevent the pseudo-developmental favorite of the election , Pelta , at the top of the FAČR . </seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stresses that he only if he wins the role of the chairman intends to exercise a year , until 2013 , until the date of the proper general meeting . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of the chairman would have liked it to be a " golden parachutes , " the Russia--at is not too much in the football . </seg>
<seg id="46">" With some in question people I have spoken personally . " </seg>
<seg id="47">" Hard to believe that I have some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football . </seg>
<seg id="48"> " Such views would have liked to have changed , " he quoted . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Most of all is Paclík supposedly the link Pelta 's with the chairman of the Pilsner district Football Association Berbr novel , a man with kontroversem reputation , which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist , with the ability to influence delegated votes in general meetings . </seg>
<seg id="50">It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable , that Pelta holds the position of the chairman . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">" In his victory would become of einkonserviert and in the Czech football is not it at all . " </seg>
<seg id="52">" The support of Berbr , a cleverem Businessman , would get the football pollero twice , " said Paclík . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">It is he , too , that Pelta ' was 's name some time ago in connection with the investigation of corruption in a case , from the Pelta but go unpunished . </seg>
<seg id="54">" I do not know what Prestige; a victory of Pelta (tsch .) football should get involved . " </seg>
<seg id="55">" And where would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA , " said ekl Paclík , its former said , " it will sell the Pilsner football club , when will Pelta chairman ' , but something more . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Should win Paclík in Thursday 's election , he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta . </seg>
<seg id="57">Just as another candidate thinks - Rajchl , had supported the Paclík before the general meeting in October , which ended with a fiasco . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">" He (Pelta) would be the first , to which I would go . " </seg>
<seg id="59">" He has great skills . " </seg>
<seg id="60">" I could imagine him well for example as head of the national team . " </seg>
<seg id="61">" But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager . " </seg>
<seg id="62">" It is not my nose but in matters , which I understand nothing , " said Paclík , who had been in September for attention that he was behind the recall of referee Commission with Luk Macela at the top , replacing the Dagmar Damková . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík claims , it is equal to the role of the group leader . </seg>
<seg id="64">And holding up his skills in the direction of private companies , since last summer , he is also head of Pilsen , the celebrated with his support in May the first triumph in the League . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">" I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to the cultivation of this . " </seg>
<seg id="66">" In order to limit the influence of interest groups , tend to the disciplinary and influence of commissions , which in turn to II; situations , " led to Paclík , which makes no secret of its antipathy for example to the Sparta-Chef Daniel Ketínský . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of its priorities would be the establishment of the relations between the ex-FAR and the Czech Olympia-Komitee , with which he would save in the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport . </seg>
<seg id="68">" This is one of the key things that should devote itself to the new chairman . " </seg>
<seg id="69">" When it comes to taxation of gambling , and declare the political parties , then I understand their reasoning , we have to say it but also very clearly where the money goes , " he said . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Its connection to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap , although he emphasised , the chairman of the ex-FAR " bipartisan " . </seg>
<seg id="71">, in turn , is associated with Jablonec pelta Rajchl with the Prague Dukla . </seg>
<seg id="72">" It is not ideal . " </seg>
<seg id="73">" It is not my opinion but also make much sense to transfer my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years , " said Paclík clear . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes of the ex-FAR , the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future . </seg>
</p>

<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association , one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt , Miroslav Pelta promised he would if elected , that the FAČR new statutes that disputes over the electoral law , rule out in future . </seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec believes is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and that the campaign would modest.They in any success of the Czech selection . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September , he wants to focus on his election to the national team and the collection of funds . </seg>
<seg id="78">He decided only at the last moment , to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so was the two-month break help him to defend his ideas about the running of football and in a broader context . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">" People at all levels to address the football , they are impatient and therefore expect that know the chairman on Thursday . " </seg>
<seg id="80">" He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone , the man who believes in particular is linked with the Jablonecer club , but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee . </seg>
<seg id="81">Also , he has said that it had sufficient experience , in order to lead the Czech football . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that is for today 's problems with the election of the euphoria that was at the time of Ivan Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="83">" Unfortunately have been approved by the General Assembly in June statutes , which were not completely , as it had adopted all . </seg>
<seg id="84">If they had not allowed different interpretations , from September , " said Pelta had a chairman . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">Just the revision of the most important document of the residents ' association he used as a sweetener for the delegates . </seg>
<seg id="86">" Should I be chairman , then I take it personally and I am prepared to take personal responsibility , if it does not work . " </seg>
<seg id="87">" It is a matter of principle , without which he could not be , " said Pelta . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition , he is not trying to differentiate themselves from his opponent . </seg>
<seg id="89">He had announced earlier , it could be a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl , recognizes the for its legal education , and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">Also Tomáš Paclík , he has been for a long time , which , in turn , no dry thread Pelta the1990 . </seg>
<seg id="91">In football it can more than a year ago and is already moving with some success . " </seg>
<seg id="92">" But its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were very shocked by his election campaign . " </seg>
<seg id="93">" Also addressed now many doubt his true nature , " Pelta remain faithful to his opponent , probably the Caribbean-basin repeating proclamations , which he said in September . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">His opinion , its biggest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions , to the national team . </seg>
<seg id="95">And this should be the flagship Czech football . </seg>
<seg id="96">" I would try to end all Affairen - from the issue Bohemians , to the halls of the corruption scandal last year . " </seg>
<seg id="97">" Then , would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football , " said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate TK two months ago . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At that time , he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football no human cleansing; would mean . </seg>
<seg id="99">" I had to make myself with the content of all employees familiar , " he said in Strahov , where there is because of the long anarchy; understandably nervous . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios , which accompany the forthcoming general meeting , he believes that the delegates on Thursday will not go to Nymburk in vain . </seg>
<seg id="101">" If there really should be the only point of contention , as you choose in the third round , then we will be over . " </seg>
<seg id="102">" The football needs credibility and win back only when he finally has a new Leader ' , Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day its official career optimistic . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that to work the ex-FAR below him hard begins </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If should be elected the ViceChairman Jindich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic , would supposedly feeding frenzy that many people in the group the whim . </seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that , if elected , to work hard . </seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual Fußballbereiche . </seg>
<seg id="107">Also promised to resolve the case Bohemians , relations with the UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and will continue the work that has begun the previous presiding Ivan Hašek . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">" As chairman , I would like to dwell on the football as a whole . " </seg>
<seg id="109">From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA , on the national selection , the professional football , to the performance of football for the youth . " </seg>
<seg id="110">" This is not to say that I want to do everything alone , " said Rajchl in talks for ČTK . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">" I am a team player and would like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee in such a way that is devoted to each member a certain area . " </seg>
<seg id="112">And I will distribute hard tasks , so that the football in every segment with twelve-mile steps . " </seg>
<seg id="113">Mafias; many would not just delighted , because they , rather than the work of other to criticise , now even to work really hard , " he added . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered not to stand at all . </seg>
<seg id="115">" I know that I am working 20 hours a day . " </seg>
<seg id="116">" But I must know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me , not me constantly stick; between the legs and every step that I make , calling into question , " he said as an explanation as to why he has hesitated . </seg>
<seg id="117">" However , many people have told me that I should not give up , because it would otherwise also others do . " </seg>
<seg id="118">" It is confidence , we must not squander it , " he said . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">Supposedly motivated him to be able to continue the work , which he has begun between Hašek . </seg>
<seg id="120">I now " in two years , we have dealt with a great deal of work and this is not simply throw . " </seg>
<seg id="121">" It has been launched processes , the only in a few years to come and I would hate to see that it is painful , " he said , and that his concerns that , in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Mr Pelta , could return to the situation in the days before Hašek . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">" I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not brings . " </seg>
<seg id="123">' behind him , especially people who would make the football so that it would be only for chosen as ' . </seg>
<seg id="124">I think I can , but not a lot that I would be biased . " </seg>
<seg id="125">" I try to be objective . " </seg>
<seg id="126">" I want football for all , because it all goes well and not only of the candidates , " said Rajchl . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs . </seg>
<seg id="128">" Even if some people say the opposite , I really don 't have to do what is best for Moravia . " </seg>
<seg id="129">" For example , it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part , whose winners in each of the first League felt . " </seg>
<seg id="130">" Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league , particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem , " Rajchl says . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman , dares Rajchl not to estimate the chances that he will be elected . </seg>
<seg id="132">" I have a strong support in the Czech Chamber , which has been elected to her deputy chairman and now realises that clear successes are behind me , " led to Rajchl , which includes the savings of tens of millions of kroner for unfortunate contracts , the agreement of Fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success . </seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand , it is partly blamed for the fact that the Association is not a single thing . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While he Pelta says , ' he was disqualified from the outset , to bring greater confidence to the Czech football ' , he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate , of the football really have something to offer . </seg>
<seg id="135">" No one can call into question , that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year . " </seg>
<seg id="136">" He should be elected , then he would continue the things that has taken Hašek Ivan and also the personnel in the commissions would not change it , obviously . " </seg>
<seg id="137">It would make things certainly not altered just want , " ruling in its favour Rajchl on his rivals . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">, the German bank their business with agricultural commodities on ? </seg>
<seg id="5">SPIEGEL-ONLINE-Informationen Josef Ackermann has a working group , the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world to examine . </seg>
<seg id="6">In January the company wants to be consequences . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg - </seg>
<seg id="8">To the Federal citizens; it is clear:84 per cent of Germans do not find it according to a study acceptable; speculate that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize . </seg>
<seg id="9">Two thirds of respondents demanding that Deutsche Bank and other financial institutions from this business , because it is the problems of the world 's poorest . </seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a Forsa-Umfrage on behalf of the consumer organization foodwatch . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report , the foodwatch in mid-October . </seg>
<seg id="12">It shows the author Harald Schumann , that the bets in global commodity markets the prices - and the banks is complicit in the global hunger problem . </seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of the consumer is specifically against Deutsche-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann , even if banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act similarly . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Originally intended natural-resource-related betting , protect against traders price fluctuations . </seg>
<seg id="15">But now , most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Unlike the US-Konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is " worth it , the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank to gamble . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE International is a working group at the accusations from the Foodwatch-Report . </seg>
<seg id="18">By the end of the year should be completed the examination , then be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank , with a recommendation , how to deal with it . </seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January will tell the top of the bank , then the consequences of it . </seg>
<seg id="20">In the end could be a reduction of the commodity business , or even the complete departure . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann turn to his image </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Foodwatch-chef Thilo Bode welcomed the news , but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: " The betting on rising prices of food shows a particularly vivid , ruthlessly banks today as the common good . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann , the chief lobbyist banks , particularly in the duty . </seg>
<seg id="24">" The Deutsche Bank must remove all term-assets from its portfolio , in which money is used for betting on food prices , " said Bode . </seg>
<seg id="25">" Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank goes . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The clear-mindedness of Mr Ackermann at first glance surprising , but it is clear that the president of the company himself a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture . </seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board . </seg>
<seg id="28">With a move away from the controversial agri-foodstuffs speculation he could clean up its image . </seg>
<seg id="29">And care for possible reductions it hardly needs to do - that would have finally , his successor . </seg>
</p>

<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high . </seg>
<seg id="32">To date , more than 30.000 internauts have already taken part in the campaign of the organisation . </seg>
<seg id="33">On Tuesday , Bode the survey , for which the institute Forsa on 7 th and 8 th November 1001 people has asked . </seg>
<seg id="34">Just eleven percent think it is legitimate for that offers the Deutsche Bank Annexes involving bets on prices for food . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers would also consider personal consequences , if they know that their bank is involved in such high-profit-margin: every second would announce the poll , all installations , which flows of money into the commodity speculation . </seg>
<seg id="36">43 per cent would advise friends of such a bank , 49 to reflect , to terminate their account and to move to another institution . </seg>

<seg id="2">The umgezogene pavilion </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">By Mrs Wiensowski </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An architecture history with ups and downs , End happy: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels , 1958 , was in Vienna to the museum , and unladen 's . </seg>
<seg id="5">Now he is in the exhibition . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If of modern architecture Greater , of clear forms , glass , the halls , courageous swings and new building materials are typical of the belief in the technical progress , it is the Austrian pavilion of the architects Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels Expo 1958 a good and famous example . </seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and completely Stahl-Glas-Konstruktion . </seg>
<seg id="8">The construction has , to date as a milestone contemporary architecture . </seg>
<seg id="9">He made the architects so well known that the Austrian also in the next World Expo pavilion , . </seg>
<seg id="10">With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich , he was 1973 , internationally famous . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His as a temporary construction planned exhibition pavilion had been drawn up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden in Vienna southern railway station , converted and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20 st century - the ' 20 s , " it was called . </seg>
<seg id="12">Was defective and technically the buildings but neither space as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art , not a good climate . </seg>
<seg id="13">It was , however , used until such time as the contemporary art in Vienna a new house . </seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001 , the building was empty and more and more . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now has transformed the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion , he is now " 21 's House " and will be used in future as a museum for contemporary art . </seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday evening opened the museum celebration , which includes the House , where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Has managed the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco , which was 2007 new member of the Austrian gallery celebration . </seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-arco , qualified art historian with considerable career , in the youth and Eiskunstläufererin , later at Sotheby 's , the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg , the conversion to politicians and Denkmalschützern , they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and set the use . </seg>
<seg id="19">The present art should be issued the works of the Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation , a café and a book shop there should be , and an office building had to be built . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision , small budget </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the operation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation . </seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because he Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and South-Mediterranean and had won the competition , but because he Schwanzer has studied at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was " incredibly important place ' , in which he " almost every weekend " had read the exhibitions . </seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the Ur-Entwurf , and he knew the problems of the building , which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the current restructuring there was far greater problems: the buildings was " a Energieschleuder , " Krischanitz says . </seg>
<seg id="25">The page-window profiles of the glass facade were replaced , glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special security glass . </seg>
<seg id="26">Kältebrücken-stahlträger have been strengthened or replaced , and asbestos full blankets were rescued . </seg>
<seg id="27">Two missiles were under way for the new use , a abgesenkter light gap between House and road; provides for the Belichtung , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building , but still the easy Schwanzer-Pavillon . </seg>
<seg id="28">The original external doors have remained , the House is deleted in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-Farbton . </seg>
<seg id="29">And the theatre is exactly the way is even more , as he was in the past . </seg>
<seg id="30">And all this under strict supervision of the monument and with a small budget . </seg>
<seg id="31">" Often had to be found a material that is good and proper , and was also the Denkmalschutzamt ' , says Krischanitz and points to a raw language in the soil Untergeschoss . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the pressures , problems and improvements to the building has remained flexible and easily . </seg>
<seg id="33">It was difficult with the pavilion , " came the from Brussels , " said Krischanitz recently , a typical " Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte . " </seg>
<seg id="34">I am a architecture " always in the wrong place ' and to ' give a real awareness . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case is the 21 House; but not in the wrong place , because it is an urban stroke of luck: the Swiss garden there is just the completely new planned " Hauptbahnhofsquartier , with office and residential buildings . " </seg>
<seg id="36">And another stroke of luck will be perhaps: The 21 s house could be strengthened by another Krischanitz-Bau , because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought out the Berlin art , and we hear that they negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden . </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The scandal of the Bank Zürisee </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The abenteuerlichste Bank of Europe is not in Italy or France , but in Switzerland . </seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS in the financial crisis nearly bankrupt and slide since then from one crisis to another . </seg>
<seg id="4">Now it will be a German . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So it is certainly not intended Axel Weber . </seg>
<seg id="6">After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he would take up a 2013 almost as spectacular new job: President of the Management Board of Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was publicly , praised the Switzerland; whether their beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and the1990 warm remarks about the future colleagues . </seg>
<seg id="8">" The UBS has the Turnaround managed . " </seg>
<seg id="9">" I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But back in September , it was clear that everything would be quite different . </seg>
<seg id="11">A trader of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and been around EUR 1,7 billion . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald Grübel , not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers , had to go . </seg>
<seg id="13">The President of the Board of UBS , since , as has - and ask all: when will finally Axel Weber ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Was already known that Weber may discuss the Bank of February 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="15">And the board , he is already in May - not only in 2013 , as the bank said on Tuesday . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel Weber , the hard . </seg>
<seg id="17">It is not a banker , economics professor and central bankers and would have had a long time certainly needed . </seg>
<seg id="18">With a stroke , he takes then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank , which has once again demonstrated , that they have the title " biggest Skandalbank of Europe " deserves . </seg>
<seg id="19">Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and the slide for years by a scandal in the next . </seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing , it seems , is spared the once so proud Swiss bank . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis . </seg>
<seg id="22">By 2007 , the UBS has had an excellent reputation . </seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the secretive and solid , but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters it had combined with ambitious objectives: you wanted to be in the investment banking a very large number . </seg>
<seg id="24">So the UBS managed 2007 with $ 1,6 trillion more money high-net-worth customers than any other bank in the world . </seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand it as investment bank in the League of the largest banks in the world . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made impression . </seg>
<seg id="27">Told the former bankers and later a professor banks in Zurich Hans right: " my students I have presented the UBS at the time as a model of good bank . " </seg>
<seg id="28">" Today , we wonder: how could I am wrong only ? " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He wrongly huge . </seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 , for the first time that something great schieflief in the UBS . </seg>
<seg id="31">In the middle of the year , Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising , who was by then as high intellectual and ingenious bankers . </seg>
<seg id="32">Some months later it was , how he had gone . </seg>
<seg id="33">The investment in the bank , with Subprime-Papieren been and had to write off billions . </seg>
<seg id="34">In order to shoulder the , the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs . </seg>
<seg id="35">So it was actually investors , but which , on the gerümpft some until shortly before the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund , which was not the case that was not even his name . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first blow . </seg>
<seg id="37">It was worse in April 2008 . </seg>
<seg id="38">The Bank had to announce new billion losses , Board President Marcel Ospel , 2006 of the second best paid board of Switzerland , resigned . </seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008 , following the disaster: the UBS was given their bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state . </seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank , the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities , the Swiss Confederation , six billion francs for a forced change bond that they could be Miteigentümerin the Bank . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole country was shocked , because she has said , as it is for a small country , if it so dramatically large banks . </seg>
<seg id="42">After all , the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic). </seg>
<seg id="43">" Once again , we could not save the UBS ' , says banks researchers right . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">On the first disaster subscribed to the second . </seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later surrendered in the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients , with the help of the bank had evaded taxes . </seg>
<seg id="46">Also agreed to a payment of $ 780 million - as a repayment unjustified profits from these shops and Strafaufschlag . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">So that doet the UBS more or less open , in the tax evasion . </seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secretiveness--rooted . </seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same . </seg>
<seg id="50">It followed the resignation of head and administration; Council President . </seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of customers ' money . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Had lost the bank within a few months their credibility in two key business areas: in investment banking by the false speculation and in the asset management by the aid to tax evasion . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And just as it has been somewhat calmer , just as it was thought , will now get the UBS it again , because this is unfortunate Händler-Geschichte: an individual traders been EUR 1,7 billion , before the bank , that something was wrong . </seg>
<seg id="54">And it seems to be: in the risk management in the investment banking works out there are obviously still not . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">" With the case Adoboli has to be said that has changed the risk control too little , " says Martin Janssen , an economist and professor at the Institute of the University of Zurich . </seg>
<seg id="56">Also the Finanzvorstand of a large German bank is sure of the UBS: " The problem is that they do not control , the risk control . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was just the idea of caution , which were the Swiss bankers for a long time to be guardians of the great wealth of the world: not too many risks , and safety for money - was also collapse across the Alps of the world . </seg>
<seg id="58">The coffers of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The office of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the excellent Swiss private bank - yet it is just a little bit bigger . </seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic; . </seg>
<seg id="61">The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich Bahnhofstraße , from the Central Station , directly to the Zürichsee , of the will of the Letná summits of the Swiss mountains frames . </seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are magnificent , , the shop rents are among the highest in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="63">Jewellers as Tiffany 's here between Swiss tradition , such as the Confiserie Sprüngli . </seg>
<seg id="64">Stay here for centuries the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius bear . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The reception of the Hemicycle UBS is through a revolving door . </seg>
<seg id="66">Are dressed in the marble walls , be thick leather chair , along with the logo of a great sign for " safe . " </seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer wants: security here . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of Swiss Bank have both big Swiss banks , UBS and Credit Suisse , has , however , eventually betrayed - or , as the head of a small Swiss private bank . </seg>
<seg id="69">His name he would rather not read in the newspaper , finally , he , like all Swiss bankers , also deals with the two big banks . </seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS has become far too big , he - especially in investment banking , where would spread the Anglo-Saxons . </seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss have nothing more to say . </seg>
<seg id="72">" And if they do , they have adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed , it was the Anglo-saxon investment banking , which changed the UBS , its only high profits , and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the Subprime-Dschungel as much money as the Swiss large bank . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On 15 October 2008 , the disaster was visible . </seg>
<seg id="75">" On that Wednesday , the coalition government of the seven million small country the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation , " writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book " The UBS-Crash . " </seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs or around 45 billion euros approved the politicians , in order to save the bank before the bankruptcy . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen ? </seg>
<seg id="78">When you talk with Swiss bankers , so they see the problem , in the size of the UBS . </seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 , up two of the three big Swiss banks to a huge company . </seg>
<seg id="80">It was a bank , which has been in the merger was too large for the small Switzerland; - and further and further grew up . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different Vorläufer-Banken supplemented the UBS: a rich , but verschlafene bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer , but even more internationalized . </seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly the globalised investment banker favourable much money , with which it is a huge wheel . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli , president of the UBS from 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , the chairman of the board at the time . </seg>
<seg id="84">" I always thought , Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team , " says banks researchers Hans right . </seg>
<seg id="85">" Wuffli , the intellectuals , Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics , and Ospel belly , the person who has worked , from the bank lesson to the top . " </seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel have ended up on Wuffli . </seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: " He thought that his models were the reality , " says sound right . </seg>
<seg id="88">" This is a tragic case . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic , perhaps . </seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: embolden came before the fall . </seg>
<seg id="91">The UBS remember clearly to the Führungskräfte-Meetings on which to group chief Wuffli always have the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone . </seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world . </seg>
<seg id="93">It was the " League Tables ' , the rankings , which documented the success of the banks that time . </seg>
<seg id="94">Then wanted to UBS , after at the top . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps were in it . </seg>
<seg id="96">In the foreign exchange and stock in trade , with it at the top . </seg>
<seg id="97">Business advisers who have been charged , stressed , however , a weakness: the international interest in business , the bankers , " Fixed Income , " there is a huge gap to the largest banks . </seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">In order to close this gap , UBS in an adventure , which they almost cost the existence . </seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth , both the Bank and invested a newly-established hedge funds in American Subprime-Anlagen before it . </seg>
<seg id="101">It has become a huge machine , the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and , post-Napoleonic - but it also risks . </seg>
<seg id="102">Also , as were other banks for the exit . </seg>
<seg id="103">" Even in the summer of 2007 , when the American property market in flames , has bought the UBS there , " says banks expert; right . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So great the euphoria , so deeply the case . </seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after another had to go as compared with the attempts organization--one more difficult . </seg>
<seg id="106">Items in the UBS were the weapon and are still shaky . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Who the bank now , has an almost impossible job . </seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank of all nearby business models are strangely . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banks researchers right already has an idea: stop the investment banking , focus on asset management , return to the Swiss roots . </seg>
<seg id="110">The bank will not (yet) go quite so far . </seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment-banking activities should shrink sharply , it is already clear . </seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy . </seg>
<seg id="113">The 51 -year-old Italo-Schweizer was intended only as a temporary solution , and divided the Bank is surprising of predecessors; Grübel . </seg>
<seg id="114">Now authoritarian-would-be-democratic it: it is the business of UBS , told the Zurich Bank on Tuesday . </seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level in the mid-1990s . </seg>
<seg id="116">3500 posts cut it . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">This will not be enough . </seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision . </seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it ? </seg>
<seg id="120">What do they earn money ? </seg>
<seg id="121">Those are the questions that is Axel Weber safe; now . </seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly he says so far , only that he would seek with his wife in a home in Zurich . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Begins sensitive and generous Peter Englunds new book ' beauty and horror . Told a story of the First World War , in nineteen giants ' with a long list of players , the anticipate--a to heart . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">This is a piece of advice that could be as: Cut from this side of you and make you to read your sign . </seg>
<seg id="4">They are these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative to know each other very well , and these players will be your GPS function , as a beacon in just a few moments , in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and your illusions . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist . </seg>
<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy to win the Nobel Prize for literature . </seg>
<seg id="7">He has written an unusual book , which he does not , describes as " a work of the Anti-Geschichte " inappropriate . </seg>
<seg id="8">It contains only a few big names , major contracts or miracle-working battles , there is little ambassadors , racing reporters or discussions on tactics and equipment . </seg>
<seg id="9">It is less a book on what happened , he says , but rather " a book about how it was . " It is about " feelings , impressions , experience and moods . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">" Beauty and horror " almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war , of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountain increase , doctors , ambulance drivers and office workers . </seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people to be heroes . </seg>
<seg id="12">Some will lose to prisoners of war , be born , crazy or die . </seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these lives future has come as the Votivkerzen in a church , some , while another lapse . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Englunds book deviates from the usual history books . </seg>
<seg id="15">It is also the idea that the first world war was just the devastating war , on the west front . </seg>
<seg id="16">" Beauty and horror ' is with experts view of other war theaters: the Alps , the Balkans , the Ostfront , Mesopotamia , East Africa . </seg>
<seg id="17">To the soldiers in this book , bee-related baskets , is celebrating Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt , Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is almost from the outset a moving book . </seg>
<seg id="19">The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster , like a hurricane; Katrina , the smells of the Kordit . </seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children , and cannon fire in the distance . " You or you take the flight ? </seg>
<seg id="21">Who is at all ? </seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being waged at all . </seg>
<seg id="23">" Lack of facts , " Englund finds , " were on assumptions assumptions , hopes , fears , hare-brained ideas , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumours contribute . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">" Beauty and horror " of individuals such as Florence Farmborough , an English nurse in the Russian army , and Richard root , a young German ship sailors . </seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories have been Africa-centric memories , letters and other already (material removed . </seg>
<seg id="26">Their life reports can be shocking or simple , but they are very alive in Englunds details in the possession of small moments . </seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them act of shortages and aban Behelfen . </seg>
<seg id="28">In the history of a German Schulmädchens he is telling: " replacement , substitute everywhere . " </seg>
<seg id="29">' replacement aluminum coffee , wrong , wrong eraser , paper , wood buttons . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He tells more of the replacement eat in Germany . </seg>
<seg id="31">He describes ' meat , which made large rice and was struck in Hammelfett (and least was served with a false bone from wood), tobacco , which was made from dried roots and dried and potato , shoes , which were besohlt with wood . " </seg>
<seg id="32">It was , as he noted , " In 837 , spare funds , which were allowed in the manufacture of sausages , 511 registered coffee spare resources . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories act of honour and bravery . </seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognises his own drive to the ferocity and says about the war: " We feel that this is in spite of everything , rather than for men , was to sit in the Lehnstuhl , with the evening , or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand , and to do so , as is such a veneer of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely , acknowledges a British soldier that he probably die and nobody notice or would be done . </seg>
<seg id="36">" If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves , , we would like to think that this is happening in front of a crowd , " he writes . </seg>
<seg id="37">Instead , it is so terrible as " a convicted man who was hanged in secret . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations of the old Europe act , which does not fall apart , and on new kinds of terror . </seg>
<seg id="39">" The conflict was becoming an increasingly economic competition , " Englund writes , " a war between the factories . " </seg>
<seg id="40">He starts the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the Bestiarium of young century ' , ' the word streamlined and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick , the slaughter , while he is sitting behind a desk . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unforeseen ways and there is also frivoles behaviour as heroic . </seg>
<seg id="42">Englund is the soldiers who were actively being infected with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease , in order to escape the front . </seg>
<seg id="43">" The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade with Gonokokken-Eiter , because soldiers and on their genitals grease , in the hope that , come to the hospital , " he writes . </seg>
<seg id="44">" Those who were really desperate , rieben him in the eyes , which led to the rest of their lives they were blind . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves will Englunds versemongering elastic and intrusiveness and fits in perfectly with his human task . </seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes is he the kind and a way , as the war " has a unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . " </seg>
<seg id="47">The people are starting to ask why their leaders they bring to the fighting . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War were distorted as Paul Fussells ' Great War and Modern Memory " or novels like Erich Maria Remarques " nothing new " in the West as extensive history books . </seg>
<seg id="49">Englunds band is an unconventional Ruhmeshalle . </seg>

<seg id="3">All , was what we needed , was the success of the revolt , the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and an end to the American interference . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Thursday , the Committee for international relations of the Senate a resolution , which the chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">" This resolution is a tribute to the brave people of Libya , which started with the reconstruction of their country , " said Kerry . </seg>
<seg id="6">" It is a validation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may sound innocent , but so far nothing was simply in the Libya debate . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer strove legislators of both parties and the White House on the wording of a series of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the US military 's role in the Libyen-Mission ΝΑΤΟ . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June , Kerry and McCain a resolution , which approved the limited use of US military forces in Libya . </seg>
<seg id="10">The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties and there was no vote . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But on the same day , this law in the Senate by the chamber . Right-by-right outvoted a decision to cut the funds for American operations in Libya . </seg>
<seg id="12">This US , the mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress , which was upset enough to criticise Obama 's approach within the mission , but not angry enough to him once and for all the rug from under our feet . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events . </seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October . </seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate may be willing to take action . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the Committee for international relations " congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their exceptional perseverance in their own liberation " and " praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners , the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya , for their exceptional courage and professionalism . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also repeated " the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya 's transition to democracy . " </seg>
</p>

<seg id="3">It should not happen , there are hundreds of prosecutor ready for the next hearing . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers . </seg>
<seg id="5">It was in October 2008 and they just returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego the dinner with a friend , when they met at a male colleagues , the one he Pack; beer in 12 . </seg>
<seg id="6">He asked them , whether he is likely to accompany them along a drink in her room . </seg>
<seg id="7">My alarm went to " , " Lyman said . </seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns . </seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: ' Oh , no , he is 19 . </seg>
<seg id="10">He is from Texas , " she said . </seg>
<seg id="11">" I wish I had listened to my gut instincts . " </seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer , the man behind it , put it down and raped them , it claims . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week , on 18 November , wait; Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials fearful of a process with a historic hearing in Arlington , Virginia , which will decide whether a complaint , it against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld , have made , will be allowed in court . </seg>
<seg id="14">The complaint alleges that Gates and not Rumsfeld against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Rose to 28 in February by Susan Burke , a lawyer in Washington , D.C. , the complaint initially covered 17 claimants , but in the coming months:25 women and three men , all of which claim that they were raped by Soldatenkollegen or sexually abused , and that the military failed to identify , condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks , available to it . </seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says she has the top military leadership , as will the problem there . </seg>
<seg id="17">" The military is hierarchical , " she says . </seg>
<seg id="18">" Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture retaliate; of ? The leadership . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also says that she has contacted since February approximately 400 more survivors , many of them could be part of future complaints . </seg>
<seg id="20">Their strategy: instead of all the plaintiff adduces lay their eggs in one basket , they will , if necessary , many more complaints , in order to maintain the pressure . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence , led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride , has made an application to reject . </seg>
<seg id="22">The files of the court , the Newsweek , in detail the defence strategy , primarily for the military , not of current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for injuries , which have occurred in the armed forces . </seg>
<seg id="23">Because of a law of the Supreme Court , which dates from 1950 , the so-called Feres-Doktrin , the government is not responsible for violations , the soldiers on active service . </seg>
<seg id="24">" The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs , " states the document . </seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950 s . </seg>
<seg id="27">If women are not permitted to service is still in the fight , it is the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts . </seg>
<seg id="28">Team of female soldiers increasingly important roles to play in both Iraq and Afghanistan , particularly in the contact with local women in the war zones . </seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between the two wars , 150 soldiers have died , two thirds of them in hostilities . </seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that will modernize the military , says Burke . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And it is not alone in their struggle as: three further complaints are out of their pending . </seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School , the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four most important military colleges because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere . </seg>
<seg id="33">This is independent of the voluntary Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military , to be out the diagnosis " personality disorder " focused , received the rape victims , in order to release them from the service - a way in which the activists as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women 's Action Network , a human rights group . </seg>
<seg id="34">Their group was in December complaint against the veteran administration (of .: management of war veterans), in which they did their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people , saying the , have been sexually abused in the service . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties submitted to the Congress , which will provide a number of leads . </seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010 , according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (sposi .: Department of Defense Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) 3.158 sexual abuses . </seg>
<seg id="37">But the majority of the abuses are not reported at all and , after the own estimate of the Pentagon takes account of this number around 13,5 per cent of the estimated 19.000 cases , which it per year . </seg>
<seg id="38">The report , which was published in March , is also examining the Strafverfolgungsraten:2010 was 20 percent of the cases in the military , only half as many as in the civil law in court . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in Burke 's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of non-newsworthy . </seg>
<seg id="40">In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack . </seg>
<seg id="41">In the night , she says , has been asked it 11 times , the details of the rape of a number of police officers , doctors and to tell commanders . </seg>
<seg id="42">They had a rape set and the blood of the shooter that arose from a cut on his arm , was found in her bed . </seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later , in April 2009 , was heard by a judge . Lyman during this hearing was asked after the sex , they had before the attack with her friend . </seg>
<seg id="44">Six people have said , as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator , who was acquitted . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">" I well remember the day when the verdict was read out , " Lyman says . </seg>
<seg id="46">" I thought the labor would use . I ran screaming from the courtroom . " </seg>
<seg id="47">" They brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that I , when I go back to my commander , said: this was not his procedure . That was my procedure . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman has been invited to visit a military psychiatrist , a personality disorder diagnosed and said for service . </seg>
<seg id="49">In January 2010 , it was honorably discharged , so that they have no support . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the complaint , the Lyman and the other plaintiff , have tabled , is pure speculation , says John Turley , professor of law at George Washington University Law School . </seg>
<seg id="51">Nonetheless , it says: " in my opinion they should move forward . " </seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a judgment , is this doctrine , criticised the will , for the first time since she was called into question . </seg>
<seg id="53">I am a critic of the time life Feres-Doktrin . </seg>
<seg id="54">The military is lagging behind a decade , because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence , which is a liability . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: " The chances are against it ... but it is important for them that they try it . " </seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change , if good people are ready to fight . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing is not their way , Burke , the lawyer for the plaintiffs , start with hundreds of other plaintiff for future cases . </seg>
<seg id="58">" We will continue our struggle against the military in this regard , until it comes to reforms , " she says . </seg>

<seg id="3">On Monday had Breivik , who has been , in a killing spree in Norway in July , in which 77 people were killed , his first public court hearing . </seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik may have acted alone , he is not far from alone in cyberspace;: he has spent much time until his attack on his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists , support the extreme right-wing groups on social networks . </seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people . </seg>
<seg id="6">But as we find them ? </seg>
<seg id="7">This is easy - we must EUDemocrats.org only on Facebook . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">" We have found that it was not difficult , to go to them , " says Jamie Bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="9">Facebooks and personal data is so enzyklopädisch , says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply Werbetool the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - as do retailers for years . </seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team was half a million fans of far-right groups in Europe and visierte to them with Adds , but rather than with a new collar; or to set a new diet product , have invited the Adds users to a survey in which , after their level of education , was asked its attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Thanks to Facebook , Bartlett and his colleagues were in a position to more than 10.000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without even once her office that they would have had to leave . </seg>
<seg id="12">" It is a fairly new research method , " says Bartlett . </seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results hardly surprising . Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young , male and resent the immigration . </seg>
<seg id="14">But in a kind of surprising mispresentation " those who their online activism with a Offline-Aktivismus combine sensible , democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to welcome a new tool in the hands of scientists . </seg>
<seg id="16">Ideas; factories , medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to society; trends such as " Likes ' , text messages and status updates . </seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users , which add an average of three content per day , generated Facebooks " data supernova explosion " a research multiplier-accelerator , the number of scientific work under the name of this side in the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that we can study this side people , you normally with his Clipboard not achieved in the streets . </seg>
<seg id="19">" If you tried to ask people to the British National Party , earlier , it was very difficult to identify them . " </seg>
<seg id="20">" They were the first party and which would have given them never access , " says Bartlett . </seg>
<seg id="21">' on Facebook is a everything away - you will go directly to them . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve . </seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook , significantly more problem drinking are as students who remained silent on this issue . </seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno proposes that equal students , for example , the Wohnberater , monitor and help a postet these students , if too many status updates . </seg>
<seg id="25">" You can 't solve a problem , if you have not recognized , " said Dimitri Christakis , Morenos Ko-Autor and director of the Child Health , Behavior and Development at Seattle Children 's Research Institute of the Washington Post . </seg>
<seg id="26">" We have found a way to identify children at risk , the different; had not been found . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also zapft constantly the data of its own people . </seg>
<seg id="28">The data team has statistics on the side of the relationship status and Valentine 's Day , the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National bliss-inducing index (which have been used in the first place , has only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have known for a long time that should make the side their great data treasure trove for other for research purposes .) </seg>
<seg id="29">But the users of Facebook , know that the side they observed , whether they like it or not . With a friend , which is thousands of miles away , to play Scrabble , the side 's own personal data will be allowed . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey that they do not even know something ? </seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have strict guidelines laid down , as they collect their data offline , is online . </seg>
<seg id="32">" I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that researchers have their profiles could study , " says Neil Selwyn , a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab , a study in 2006 , in which he investigated the public sides of students on Facebook . </seg>
<seg id="33">" What they are concerned , it was only for them and their friends . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of the methodology . </seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline , there is no guarantee that is a research participants absolutely honest . </seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook , it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a profile and in contributions are true . </seg>
<seg id="37">" What you on Facebook says and what we do outside of Facebook , are two completely different things , " says Selwyn . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore , Selwyn despite his years as a technology that researchers are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools , can use the each . </seg>
<seg id="39">" There is no substitute for it to go in the real world and to speak with real people , " he says . </seg>
<seg id="40">" Social research must take care of the social aspects - lots and lots of social life is still offline . " </seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons from the interviews with the late Steve Jobs , was shown this week in a theatre </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Compared to the death of Steve Jobs on October 5 , some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology; genius as a great modern inventors . </seg>
<seg id="3">What are Apple-Fans but perhaps the most in the recently discovered Jobs-Interview , which has been dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets , is how has this very creative head; business processes and procedures . </seg>
<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer , a dreamer and even appointed Hippie , but he was also a meticulous detail organizer , the bastelte to Diagrammen - a man who believed that many business leaders " a disease of thought , ' that ' is a really great idea 90 per cent of the work ... [ but ] there is a huge amount of craft-type art between a great idea and a great product . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">1995 , Bob Cringely the TV series ' triumph of the computer . Fachidioten " with the dawn of the staff and he was sitting for more than an hour with jobs , in the one of the rare , detailed talks led . </seg>
<seg id="6">At that time were passed over 10 years , since then had been pushed jobs; from Apple , and already he was working hard on his new computer companies NeXT , and looked forward to the broad adoption of the Internet . </seg>
<seg id="7">While used a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots , he says that the lack of Kopiervorlagen interviews in the supply . </seg>
<seg id="8">Only after Jobs death discovered a full VHS-Kopie in the garage of the director . </seg>
<seg id="9">This easy; revised film material is the basis for the 68 film of " Steve Jobs: The Lost interview , " which is this Wednesday and Thursday in the Landmark-Theater . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is known for its extensive interviews , jobs here surprisingly busy in its technological philosophies and business strategies . </seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly pause . </seg>
<seg id="12">In the course of the interview it is four times to longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds Nachsinnen , where jobs is clearly his thoughts balance and accuracy . </seg>
<seg id="13">There are moments in which jobs ' perfect days , when he apparently impatiently awaiting Cringelys issues to react and it anschubst , faster on issues or Nebenhandlungen of greater importance . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before the era of Pixar , iPod or iPhone seems somehow that people interview included far-sighted , if jobs , what other companies with him right or wrong and its own vision for the future of the computer . </seg>
<seg id="15">It is a thing; posthumous awards the career jobs ' to read , but jobs here as the thrill of greedy dreamer to see , which is on the leap to the grandeur , is something quite different , original and inspiring . </seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things could be and should be . </seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after he had said all this here , he drew and made it . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the Verlorenen interviews: </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As he learned to lead a company: </seg>
<seg id="20">" Throughout the years in the business I always ask , " Why are you doing things ? " And the answer , you always get is , ' Oh , it will be easy . " </seg>
<seg id="21">Who knows why he does what he is doing , nobody in the business to think very carefully about things . </seg>
<seg id="22">I have noticed that . </seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs continues its efforts to streamline from , the accounting; Apple . </seg>
<seg id="24">Were amazed to see costs recorded - predominantly began with " Standardkosten " , the mere suspicion been costed and which were then adapted with " deviation " - it developed an automated factory , who ensured that the recurring costs until the regulations could be determined . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">As has been veralbert the Pope: </seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs; told of the " Blue Box , " which he has built with Steve Wozniak , a device , with the people in the telephone company creep and could lead to talks in vain . </seg>
<seg id="27">Has been on the machine , but jobs enthusiasm , as he describes the bluebox as an act of Selbstbemächtigung , is contagious . </seg>
<seg id="28">He describes how he Wozniak and test the box; would , by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone , and then working a phone call from a AT in another , while it so many durchschleifen satellites as possible . </seg>
<seg id="29">" We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if we grölte into the phone , came a minute later in the telephone next door , " said kichernd jobs . </seg>
<seg id="30">" We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves , can control the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world . " </seg>
<seg id="31">We both , we did not know much , but we were able to build this small things that can monitor a huge thing , it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them . </seg>
<seg id="32">Sake; tells us further away from a glorious gimmick , the Wozniak and he almost made have withdrawn , in the middle of the night via bluebox in the Vatican phoning and wanted to talk with the Pope , while it as far as they could Henry Kissinger nachmachten . </seg>
<seg id="33">As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night to have been called in to speak with the American diplomats , the two loslachen , before the Pope to the telephone . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he is in the technology; president (Bill Hewlett and unprepared dispute): </seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 , when it was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters , he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him . </seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after their 20 -minute telephone call , jobs for the summer work part-time in Hewlett-Packard . </seg>
<seg id="37">" This has had a remarkable impact on me and it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company; and how well his staff treated . " </seg>
<seg id="38">Later , Jobs one of the HP-Mitarbeiter , the corporation 's research laboratories in Palo Alto visited; , where he was " the first Desktop-Computer , of the ever produced . " </seg>
<seg id="39">He was as big as a suitcase , had a small screen with Braunscher tunnel and I admitted in him . </seg>
<seg id="40">I would take the HP upwards as a teenager , and are committed to this machine and programmes for they write . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How innovation improved: </seg>
<seg id="42">Several times in the interview , jobs , how do we invent spontaneously new products . </seg>
<seg id="43">Some boards early in his career , when he einbaute , he was asked by a customers , the whole computers to assemble them . </seg>
<seg id="44">He was working with a payment period of only 30 days and both had to rethink the processes and the extradition of the earth-orbiting equipment . </seg>
<seg id="45">Later in Apple is he is reminiscent of the problems , which he had in the development of a mouse: </seg>
<seg id="46">" I remember quick-dispersing arguments ... you cried to me that it would take five years [ to build a mouse that would cost $ 300 ] and I was on , went out and found a manufacturer . " </seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later we had a mouse , we have to build for $ 15 , which was incredibly credible . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">On large companies that continue: </seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he Apple lead , saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants with their vision in founder and lost control of their shares . </seg>
<seg id="50">" We say , you are working with IBM , Xerox , make you a better room or printer , so what ? " </seg>
<seg id="51">They have the equities--were monopoly , is not the company more successful . </seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and marketing such people make it successful , so [ there are ] , which ultimately lead the company and the product , with which people are being pushed out of the decision-making process . </seg>
<seg id="53">The product genius that has led to this monopoly , will of the people who have no concept of good products versus bad products , stamping-out - craft-type art . </seg>
<seg id="54">This happened in Xerox ... </seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have the whole computer industry . </seg>
<seg id="56">It could have been ten times greater , could have been the Microsoft of the 1990 s ... </seg>
<seg id="57">They have caught the defeat by the victory . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation as art form: </seg>
<seg id="59">" It is a lot of Handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product ... when we have these great idea , changing it developed and is growing . " </seg>
<seg id="60">We are learning a lot about his legalisms . </seg>
<seg id="61">It must be votes , certain things that you can 't do , but electrons , glass , machines; factories . </seg>
<seg id="62">We must mark 5000 things , these concepts , and bring it all together ... </seg>
<seg id="63">Ultimately it is tantamount to the taste , it comes down to is that an attempt is being made with the best stuff that people have created , and then tried to bring these matters to the together , what you do . </seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy , great artists steal . </seg>
<seg id="65">We are always shamelessly stealing in the great ideas . </seg>
<seg id="66">Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there , musicians , poets , artists , Zoologen , historian who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world . </seg>
<seg id="67">It would not have been in the computer business , they would create fantastic things in other areas . </seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health legislation , as a court case over-accepting </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day of the Supreme Court behind closed doors to discuss the political part of the question as to whether it will hear a challenge to the health legislation by President Obama , two of its judges , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , part of a dinner , which was of the firm gesponsort that will take the case to court . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday , and met all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration . </seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases was a complaint , the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care , which were decided last year by Congress , a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the US the catchphrase . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed to the hearing in March and is expecting a 5 1 / 2 -hour basis for discussion , which probably the result will probably increase the presidential campaign of 2012 , at the time , which will give the court decision , will be in full swing . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer who will argue in court , and that is to overturn the law , will probably be Paul Clement , once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clements Office; , Bancroft PLLC , was one of the nearly two dozen companies , which supported the annual dinner of the Federal society , an ancient group , which the defence non-socialist legal principles . </seg>
<seg id="8">Another company , which represents the dinner has sponsored , Jones Day , one of the business , the National Federation of Independent Business , the challenge the law . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc . , which is involved in the outcome of the process . </seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was a few hours after the court deliberated on the case , in a Washington hotel . </seg>
<seg id="11">Service , among other things , Mitch McConnell , the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health reform </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests of the dinners ? Scalia and Thomas . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This is nothing new: the two judges visit events organised by the Federal society for years . </seg>
<seg id="14">And it is not against moral rules . </seg>
<seg id="15">In fact , to judge by the code of conduct , which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">They were , they would probably fall within principle 4 c of the code , which states: " A judge can participate in the near fundraising law and other organisations , with the judge not a spokesperson , Khadaffi or according to programme must not be a guest of such events . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless , the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case with the related firms , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in this , in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">" This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code of the complaints of some judges lie , the court is to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said Bob Edgar , president of the common cause-célèbre , a civil rights movement in the United States . </seg>
<seg id="19">" The judges , and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending procedure on court . " </seg>
<seg id="20">Their presence and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any right to impartiality and are not acceptable . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas show little respect for critics who say that they would court matter too easily with groups that are off the agenda , such as the Federal society; mix . </seg>
<seg id="22">And the Thomas ' wife Ginni is a known conservative activist . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">However , the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan , who have a moral problem , not Scalia and Thomas . </seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was General prosecutor under the Obama administration , as the first legal challenges in the first instance in court . </seg>
<seg id="25">Their critics , Kagan , withdraw itself from the hearing of the case because of bias , since it is very committed to the defence of the law , in order to be impartial . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">" Are not affected during the war , in the fight against terrorism by the seizure , would influence the serious interference in the budget of the war effort , " Panetta warned . </seg>
<seg id="11">" Staff attitudes were being cut , leading to delays in the attitudes and the attitude , who support the war , would lead . " </seg>
<seg id="12">" The salaries of staff would be cut to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">" The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would take a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world . " </seg>
<seg id="15">" We are strongly against this draconian action , " the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon , when they Panettas letter . </seg>
<seg id="16">" This is a result that we cannot live with , and it is certainly not one that we should impose on us . " </seg>
<seg id="17">" The confiscation is a threat to national security interests of the United let us create and their commitment should not be allowed . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings from the senators the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon of cuts , remains to be seen . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has been increasingly outspoken the possible cuts , although he could have many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House , before he came to the top of the Pentagon 's , and that he is serious decisions . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference in the last week , the defence minister a gloomy picture , which could face - a military with skin , but without nuclear . </seg>
<seg id="21">" It is a ship without sailors . " </seg>
<seg id="22">" It is a brigade without ammunition . " </seg>
<seg id="23">" It is a squadron without sufficient trained pilots . " </seg>
<seg id="24">" It is a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission , " Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon . </seg>
<seg id="25">" It is an armed force , there is a lack of morality and alert and it is not in the position , with potential opponents . " </seg>
<seg id="26">" It will be a really angry . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham led to Panetta new details , such as reductions " self-creating significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis , conflicts and disasters , serious restrictions on our global nature; and intervention capability , which leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that could be some of the biggest defence projects of the victims , including those that have been tested and are already in the early planning stage . </seg>
<seg id="29">To this list also includes the fight , F35 Joint Strike Fighter , a planned new bombs , the next generation of ballistic submarines , the new Ship our , and the new ground vehicle , the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">We would stop the further development and testing of the F35 , this would be in the next 10 years to save $ 80 trillion , but the supporters say , that it is an important next step to armaments; , so that can be possible dangers posed by China and other opponents carefully; . </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much deception we see ? </seg>
<seg id="14">We as studies show , lie between 10 and 200 times every day . </seg>
<seg id="15">Many of these lies are valid but as lies . </seg>
<seg id="16">One other study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting . </seg>

<seg id="24">I have spent several years , the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of drug-dealers .

<p>
<seg id="34">Then you pay attention to accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviors . </seg>
<seg id="35">If you look at these accumulations as bells , the strident , not as proof of a exposing . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People who deceive , congealing , perhaps , if they try to remember their history and perhaps have their feet in the door or they are in the direction out-come , change their position in a significant way or show a " relaxation after the Einstellungsgespräch , this deep , " entspannende of and the change in the position that if all the hard questions are over . </seg>

<seg id="41">The most frequent verbal signs are subtly . </seg>
<seg id="42">Some people use " qualifying language , " if they answer a vexed question: " Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know is ... in good faith and conscience . " </seg>

<seg id="33">I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs , can play everyone likes another song , so that the decision , which we will play , is not easy . </seg>
<seg id="34">If we have two or three song , which we have long been not played , recorded in the repertoire , we maintain our focus better and they can surprise us , because they are the reasons why , we like this song , otherwise they could be forgotten . </seg>
<seg id="35">This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe and , therefore , for the audience . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour celebrating your ways history . </seg>
<seg id="37">If it looks back , you find it hard to believe in your success ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes , totally . </seg>
<seg id="39">First of all , I believe that none of us has presented itself to play once in a great rock band , and that more than 20 years , which is like a dream . </seg>
<seg id="40">We are also further on this blessing and find it , still able to make music together . </seg>
<seg id="41">We can and we are thrilled to produce music . </seg>
<seg id="42">We are fortunate to be able to go to the places in the world , which we have always wanted to visit again . </seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What it meant for you , to have actively participated in the birth of the way ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It has always been an honour to be part of this group of large band . </seg>
<seg id="46">We are good with the people of Sound Guards , friends Mudhoney and Alice in Chains . </seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising and very unusual , if a movement from a group of friends . </seg>
<seg id="48">Now and then , a bond from a city , but it is unusual , if five or ten groups at the same time from the same city . </seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group . </seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we still play together . </seg>
<seg id="51">Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guards on their tour , and we look forward , still friends with them all to be and it is to be part of this that Seattle-Sounds . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very unusual that a band as your zusammengeblieben is with the same musicians such a long time . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes , four of us play together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us , and that alone is much more time than last for many band . </seg>
<seg id="54">First of all , I believe that we are all happy to be still alive , and also we care about each other . </seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friend , why have opened up musical paths to allow everyone the freedom to experiment . </seg>
<seg id="56">A familiar with the others and its music , and it could not be better off . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with fame has not always been easy , on the other hand , why their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a . </seg>
<seg id="58">How is it a balance ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The way in which we are up to , has made it easier for ourselves , to find a balance . </seg>
<seg id="60">We are sure , not to be too often on tour , because it is too easy to forget this game with huge numbers of people who love your music , to escheat . </seg>
<seg id="61">As long as we keep in mind that the people are because of the music here , it reminds you that you , the music and what it has created , respected , without being too keen to be a famous rock star , which has never interested in us . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">How have you to your other project Mother Love cuts ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I believe that we have very good song written and to the beginning , it was great . </seg>
<seg id="64">We were a band for three years , until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a record . </seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed , for so long , and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (TD), with us were the collar; friends when I hear a song or see photos , I think , what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , to laugh together and on music and football and many other issues . </seg>
<seg id="66">He was an extraordinary person and we miss him . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica . </seg>
<seg id="68">Is it true that it knows its work , especially Eddie Vedder , and the band for the opening selected ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes , the production sent us videos of several groups and this band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live can offer , which will be exciting . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why change the text by Yellow Ledbetter always , if you live others-plays ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This is a question for Vedder Ed (Eddie), I have no idea . </seg>
<seg id="72">He sings it , and I believe that he is the first thing he chooses . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">By whom President; influenced you as Bassist ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Of so many + </seg>
<seg id="75">The first to come up with me , Geezer Butler , John Entwistle , C. J. Ramone , John Doe , Paul McCartney , Chuck Dukowski ... </seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many that I could talk about the Bassisten , which I liked , all afternoon . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How has it Pearl jam , the way to keep alive , even though it is no longer a fad ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word for . </seg>
<seg id="79">If I think about it , I can think of the band , which I have mentioned previously , for example , Mudhoney Sound Guards , nirvana and all the others who were at the same time , if they are still important , I think the great , because it is interesting to hear the music and band as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially was their music dark , now it is positive . </seg>
<seg id="81">Why ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting , because I believe that there are a few songs on the new album , which could be something lightly , but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark song , although they also have a good thing in itself . </seg>
<seg id="83">To two of the tears when I heard it played as Ed . It is very dark song . </seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if you are older and is something drastic in your life - for example , if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced the your artistic creation and your music and these two songs are the clear for me . </seg>
<seg id="85">However , I also believe that we can make a happier person and still dark music . </seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain ? </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects agree apart from the squabbling over the fees with the tender . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid 1980 s , the peak of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola . </seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure , den Berg described as a massive city park in Barcelona . </seg>
<seg id="6">He was even in figures; compared with the Central Park in New York . </seg>
<seg id="7">With the sinking of the CMB in 1987 , the park in the eyes of many of the ceiling of Barcelona , because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction , but upwards (mountains) and (Sea). </seg>
<seg id="8">The classification Collserolas as park plays with this idea . </seg>
<seg id="9">As a model was no longer the Central Park , but yellowbox Stone with wild pigs in the role of the Yogibärs . </seg>
<seg id="10">So far it was , as the city in September a huge Tendering , consisting of 16 competitions , spend for further access to Collserola gates . </seg>
<seg id="11">Undoubtedly , a gateway to the concept of a parks . </seg>
<seg id="12">Either this is the case , or somebody has to put doors in the country . </seg>
<seg id="13">The question arises of themselves: Collserola , park or mountain ? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The announcement is not only from organizational power , but also in a reflection on the city about the discussion of all architects from Barcelona . </seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a rekurrentes issue to the two members of the old eingesessenen caste , who meet in the lift , can use . </seg>
<seg id="16">Think about it , and this fact offers the stuff of one of the rare matches between what three architects from Barcelona , and some university professors who have applied to the project . </seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán , Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For Roldán " it is necessary , " after the attack on the coast on the " front " in the mountains , the discourse of Ildefons Cerda , on the green apples , has been held . </seg>
<seg id="19">" It should be based on the principle that mainly largest Park is the beach . </seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things , because it is easily accessible . </seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex , " is the architect , for whom the title " doors of Collserola " an " impressive " is: we must not " as access to a park , but as a limit of areas where we need to act . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol , as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience , viewed the proposal as a " intellectual challenge " that " some risks ' . </seg>
<seg id="23">Risks from the " uncertainty , which brings with it the creation of a public space today " from the 1980 s , after the experience in the field of the forum had their ' swan song ' . </seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the limit to what can be developed . </seg>
<seg id="25">" Contain something always means to determine the next step " to go beyond that . </seg>
<seg id="26">" We need to think about new urban planning instruments , because the current [ in response to the bluebrint General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol , which is close to the issue , simplified , the side of Collserola , in the sense of Valle Ana , " can be understood as a Park , not the direction in Barcelona ' , and for Judenstaatrein involved . </seg>
<seg id="28">Modol , pointed out that there is already a study by the patronage-based de Collserola , which should not " fall on deaf ears , " even though he was grateful to the City Council that it has given his body the way , " " from the first to participate in this project . </seg>
<seg id="29">He also notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief , which allows the architects , to participate in the debate , although its " doubt " to say whether this technical profile the Multi-disciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing , " he says), ' We architects should only be a tool . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex , because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: ' 16 competitions were advertised in the sample , " he says , " on the Gebirge-Meer axis . But there is no Längsschnittperspektive , the area in its entirety . " </seg>
<seg id="31">This has led at least in his case that he is participating in the 16 competitions . </seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise would clash the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors . </seg>
<seg id="33">His opinion , the city should absolutely guarantee that the swath directly on the whole length of the Ronda de Dalt is so that a soft transition between city and belt . </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Would the signs that are based on the road surface , respected , it would not be necessary to fix almost 200 000 potholes , if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera , researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM , and gave warning that if this were to happen and laying the maintenance of the Asphaltbelags , reduced the number of potholes , or even be avoided completely . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">" Bumps " from a technical point of view , in his speech he gave at the International Year of Chemistry , he knows that the laboratory , for which he is responsible , with Polymeren modified Asphalte was developing , however , in order to establish a the asphalt similar mix , the greater mechanical resistance both at high and low temperatures . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera said Nájera that this type Asphalte modified in areas with extremely hot climate , such as in some cities in the north of the country , should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of the holes . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon link , which is part of a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other a low - the so-called Malthene . Together; give them the road surface be typical zähelastisches behaviour . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C as a liquid , at 120 ° C , it is very liquid , and in 50 ° C , while he is in very low temperatures fragile . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">" That means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the roads is not uniform , but on a day depending on the weather and temperature changes change ' , the engineer . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers said the FQ , the streets of Mexico City have majority a flexible road surface which , together , from six material; classes , which included the last three asphalt . </seg>
<seg id="10">Between the top classes is a abrasion-proof layer of asphalt , from the small , in gebadeten asphalt and then entrenched stones . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Every single piece this decay , had been bathed in asphalt . </seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles to travel and produced forces , this class a good forces; distribution in the road surface . </seg>
<seg id="13">" If it were modified asphalt , would distribute the forces , even better , " said the chemical engineer . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">" On the Verschleißschicht " , he tells us , " will be a final layer , the so-called Tragschicht , interpreted the from tiny stones , that is , from sand , which has also been in asphalt sweating . </seg>
<seg id="15">Because they are class in contact with the car tyres , they need a greater force than the mechanical abrasion-proof class and they must produce friction . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The this road receives the most forces and distributed , the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is , must be maintained . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather conditions , including humidity and temperature fluctuations , are more important to take into account factors , above all , the water , " he said , " because it affects the behaviour of the abrasion-proof class . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the site is a wet , water in the class and is only difficult; back; that caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and as a result , the incidence of stroke . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a pothole , " he said , " will make the Titanic-Maru class , while the abrasion-proof class then , but the damage is not immediately , but it is a process that should be maintained at the first signs of proper maintenance programmes . " </seg>

<seg id="20">The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores national research system (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the presence of the holes , so must the thickness of each class of the surface and in relation to the vehicle , and it must be ensured that is respected in order to prevent frequent blow holes this arrangement . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="7">The big question that there are many today is: What was missing ? </seg>
<seg id="8">Because the result is the demise of a big favorite , which had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia . Not for nothing that she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor at Jolie of Vogue , title , which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro , and took the crown of Miss Colombia with home . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The first factor that is seen as crucial for the jury 's decision to appoint them to the first Miss , is that it has the answer to the question " what book you most and why ? ' , which affects their of Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria had Leamos , was not convinced . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied the author: </seg>
<seg id="11">" I read a lot , I think quite to the literature , I believe , it is a kind of ended , ultimately , I believe that the book , for my childhood most era--was , ' the small Prince ' is a very deep book . </seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement . " It is a book of universal culture that we should read all I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski , a Russian , a wonderful book , ' passions ' . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A response that was , firstly because of the term ' more civilised , ' and , secondly , because they had not declared , in what way each proposed book they had influenced . </seg>
<seg id="14">But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result , " The universe is wise , it happens , what needs to be done . </seg>
<seg id="15">And for all people: read a bit ' The small Prince ' and it is a great book . </seg>
</p>

<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the measures , which are all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to get all the prices had (Gastronomie-Wettbewerb Oster , Publikumsabstimmung on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), " made the other candidates jealous , what the Queen stresste , which could therefore not shine on the stage .

<seg id="21">Was also Valle at the end of the press from the road - a mistake . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Is a further hypothesis that could not convince the Valle Jurie on their interest in social work , which is the essence of the National beauty competition . </seg>
<seg id="23">There must be a reason that , two days before the international jury Lucy Doughty , they were a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">" Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia . We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social feeling , that she had already worked on projects from participation in the competition , " she said . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is speculation that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and fibrosis , which said it in the stomach area , had sinned , but it is inconsistent , because the jury , as a candidate for ' natural beauty , with a healthy body , good eating habits and good physical work . </seg>

<seg id="29">Their body is never their strong side , and this job; they had to pay . " </seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death . </seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians are a really out to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an excellent report by the Royal Society of Canada , were involved in the six experts , the different subject areas , including ethics , justice and medicine--a are linked . </seg>
<seg id="7">This body , the Government to amend the penal code so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia , where this election , and for patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As a prelude to the experts a recent poll by the independent EIU society , which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the Erdballes . </seg>
<seg id="9">Although has placed in Canada at the 10 th , the study noted that " has produced the death medical care in Canada a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medical care or not:77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers , tell us the of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts . </seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the desire of the overwhelming majority of Canadians , to die at home , so die , however , 68,6% of these in the hospital . </seg>
<seg id="12">The whole country is considered the rate with 86% in hospital deaths in Quebec . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the sensitive issue on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide are the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government , which has already geäuert , no changes to the law on euthanasia and want to begleitetem suicide , are against . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But now there is according to the experts , the gleichermaβen all those countries have inspected; , whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or drug use , we have no proof that such a non-criminalisation Miβbräuche in their application , so the Praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting persons would entail . </seg>
<seg id="15">Quite the reverse you encounter much more cases such breaches in the countries in which are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , as yesterday Jocelyn Downie , a co-signatory of the report , in a teleconference . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">" Euthanasia is illegal in Canada , where they are clearly , practised . " </seg>
<seg id="17">" Also physician-assisted suicide is practised in Canada , although clearly here illegally , " says Jocelyn Downie . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians support the euthanasia </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We have that , according to a -approximately- in 2010 Angus-Reid-Umfrage already carried out 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had , as they are of the opinion that this would allow it to alleviate those at the end of their career , their diseases; . </seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that do not have the issue of legalisation of euthanasia , to convey the message that besäe the lives of older or disabled people less value . </seg>
<seg id="21">In terms of the people who already have implemented a assisted suicide , the respondents to 41% are of the opinion that this should not be prosecuted . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">As far as maintenance or the resources to patients , the situation is less clear , the authors of the report . </seg>
<seg id="23">Similarly this in their Empfehlungsverzeichnis should be close to that in the penal code tunnel; , that the possibility of the funds , for the legal rejection , there have been not as criminal should apply . </seg>
<seg id="24">The panel of experts , that should be trained health care professionals in the task to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life , and this without fear of prosecution . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The body , said that governments , institutions , health care and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources , and this is also about the cancer cases . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Least , calls on the body where already wide-ranging in the Canadian institutions to health care means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen , at least to consider it , because these little as well as the euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and they relate to the same procedures spawned . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Reservations other experts </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts report published by the Royal Society of Canada . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">RA Pierre Deschamps , specialist in health law , has the attitude of the report " experts interests--including as ' extremely ' , because this is the practice of euthanasia in the final stage no borders . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">" This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and more than 18 years to ask another person to be him in his suicide help , " RA Deschamps , who had looked at yesterday a summary of the report . </seg>
<seg id="31">RA Deschamps also stresses , the author of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual above all others who are involved in the social upholstery of society . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">But now , he says , there would be " guidelines and obligations in a society . " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Margaret Somerville , expert on health law , also has a " strong opposition " to the conclusions of the report , which they described as " Pro-Euthanasie-Manifest ' . </seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville , which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada , is in particular , the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide , such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon . </seg>

<seg id="5">It is reasonable to take a Wahltreffen for a reason , to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy . </seg>

<seg id="8">Although there are 7 billion people on the planet , the demographic evolution a doubling of the electricity demand by making 2050 , must not give up a huge share of the world 's population in a vital element . </seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time , it must be the scarcity of fossil resources , in order to be able to continue to produce residuarity electricity , without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , a lost from the environmental debate issue , to forget , to combat climate Unregelmäβigkeiten . </seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters . </seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore blebt Germany continue to isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power . </seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case in Belgium , which is the decision of the need to find a replacement objectives--before replacement source , in Switzerland , which is just to build more nuclear power plants in the last generation . </seg>

<seg id="14">The United States have decided , after Fukushima , its Park another , using the following the nuclear accident Sidmar Three Mile Island once again go into operation . </seg>
<seg id="15">Even if the focused on renewable energy sources , German model occasionally as an example , that is , however , the reality the discourse . </seg>
<seg id="16">The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of the means , one by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence in particular of Russia , an increase in the gas and coal plants CO2 emissions . </seg>
<seg id="17">The whole of this unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months to come . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Denmark is a cause for thought the case . </seg>
<seg id="19">Denmark is European tables leader in wind energy , from which it takes 30% of its electricity , but the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas , used it with wind energy; because of his CO2-Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average . </seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French budgets by 40% higher electricity bills . </seg>
<seg id="21">As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key role of the competitiveness and the stability of the industry at national soil , the French electricity companies because of the best in Europe . </seg>
<seg id="22">Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy , what the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to liesse illusion . </seg>
<seg id="23">Polls showed that the price is , the very broad majority of French people , as well as little is willing to pay , they resistance against the principle of this energy source . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remind ourselves that our country 's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 inferred jobs . </seg>
<seg id="25">Because of their strong Exportcharakters brings them a whole lot of specialised small and medium-sized businesses on the international markets and makes these authors of countless jobs . </seg>
<seg id="26">France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power , it would put a Groβteil SMEs to victims , and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and Kernenergieexport would be more and more greatly reduced . </seg>
<seg id="27">The electricians would make a work on sixty years designed EPR , when is the decline of its producers ? </seg>
<seg id="28">In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are no more a as a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity . </seg>

<seg id="32">Their work teams , who have made a name for their professionalism , are the safety position just had . </seg>
<seg id="33">The nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents within 50 years . </seg>
<seg id="34">Only one , and at Three Mile Island , under normal operating conditions has occurred , and so has he been without consequences for people and the environment . </seg>
<seg id="35">At Chernobyl was the tragedy of reactor design and unendschuldbares , human error . </seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters unprecedented scale , which caused the deaths of several thousand people . </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">On this issue , there is a wide consensus between right and left . </seg>
<seg id="6">Of right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac , 1976 , had declared that " 900.000 people unemployed , including about 2 million immigrant workers , should be not a problem for a country ' , of Manicheanism side by Michel Rocard , 1990 , France " could not accommodate all the poverty of the world .

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden , as a problem , can possibly have an effect on the elections; however , it is economically costly . </seg>
<seg id="13">As we consider the economic experts Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work that combines the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How Our World Shaped migration and does Define Our Future , May 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 S.), is among the specialists; a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth , jobs and wages in the immigration; countries . </seg>

<seg id="16">Experience shows , however , that the immigrants in truth complementary are as much as the local wage workers , because they have schwerpunktmäig professions in sectors that are work technically unausgelastet . </seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract the local wage workers , the better the immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which is a result of inadequate training the labour supply . </seg>

<seg id="21">And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the Ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and the economic growth (high proportion naturalized -immigrants under American Nobel laureates; from Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants). </seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom is the timely and accurate point completion of this huge cornerstone as a victory . </seg>
<seg id="11">The project was in Poland and the Baltic States strongly contested . </seg>
<seg id="12">The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany , avoiding any train-path course by third countries (Poland and Ukraine) in the country . </seg>
<seg id="13">This is why these two countries will lose some of its power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia , by threatening to film the access to European markets . </seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw , most involved in the debate , the Nord Stream pipeline was not be avoided , with a " new deutsch-sowietischen pact " in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to compare to the occupation of Poland in 1939 . </seg>
<seg id="15">This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuerst . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe has the support of this enlargement--despite project won an even greater security of supply . </seg>
<seg id="17">But at the expense of enfeeblement European energy , because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europe were beaten . </seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has brought it in almost five years , his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich , Western countries , the strong Gasverbrauche and go to the gas out . </seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">The management is a long queue of metal , difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme , which is suspended on the entire length of nothing: either through valves , maintenance stations . </seg>
<seg id="28">A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden , but the project leaders have refrained from Sweden , as were the little eager to a Russian state company on permanent way on their shores up to see . </seg>
<seg id="29">" In the event of an accident we film the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute , " Mr Müller clarified . </seg>

<seg id="31">This case is regarded by the designers , however , only unlikely , as has been estimated the Schweinähte on a consistency of a leak per 100.000 years . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will both guaranteed by a robot under water , which is regulated to external surveillance purposes of preventing , as well as a device which is at the heart of the gas pipeline . </seg>
<seg id="33">It has the form of a cigar , miβt a metre diameter , will be introduced in the interior of the pipeline and by the gas pressure moved . </seg>
<seg id="34">After three full days of transport by the leadership at a speed of 3 metres per second , , the machine in his arrival detailed information on possible deformations such of the metal . </seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years , without being subject to the slightest repair . </seg>
<seg id="36">The Gaszirkulation is quite simply by pressure . </seg>
<seg id="37">This is 200 cash in the Zutritts- , 100 cash to the exit . </seg>
</p>

<seg id="44">" Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity , no matter how great the real grit is gas , " Mr Müller clarified . </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the gas pipeline construction has been secured to 30% of shareholders and to 70% by bank loans . </seg>
