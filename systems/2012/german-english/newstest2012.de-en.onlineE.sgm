<seg id="11">Previously more took student at the project than 12 thousands out of 4th and 8th classes part.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Maintain pro - a stylist must be also a good psychologist</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the initiating article about how stylists learn, had moaned I a little that that was a little too much material for the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">There I did not suspect in the slightest, what yet comes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Presentations of three pros out of the industry, that garment of problematic figures and a seminar about how that runs "on the place".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It yet more badly should come.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more closely the test moves, all more the more more information and practical tasks are forthcoming us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But also if the course takes place every Saturdays and Sunday, it fully is covered nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we debated with director Alena (at the course takes no single man part) how one dresses a woman, who has no ideally proportionate figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And those are nevertheless that of us.</seg>
<seg id="10">The one have boy stick are a too short neck, the other one too figure without orderly curves and again others cozy.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is the thing of the stylist to conceal wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or the necessary curves do magic forth.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We got dresses also tips, like one a woman type such as Jennifer Lopez - therefore with large breast, wide hip and narrow waist - lovely and figure emphasized, without that it causes all too provokativ.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If for example the difference between waist and hips is so large, that the skirt or the pair of pants really does not fit, one should let himself at least a piece after measure tailors.</seg>
<seg id="14">One not certainly will regret that, for well sitting clothing is simply prohibitively expensive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made skirt, one feels namely much better, than in one of the pole, that slips continually highly and, in the waist stands off, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Jungenhafte figures can permit themselves again to carry garment with folds, billowing, applications, embroidery or Raffung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">In this quantity of information and figure types, I am happily that I have an entire week time let go myself all thoroughly through the head.</seg>
<seg id="18">And nevertheless I have anxiety that it to is not to be created in view of the applied homework almost.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the course participants got allotted namely a Promi, contrive should for the Outfits suitable it - day garment and evening gown.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time we should consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I should "dress" Miranda Kerr, know that you possibly out of the campaign Victoria's it Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">In the interior, I rejoice, for that is for me personal much better to dress than for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, that increased recently probably at the hundred kilos, (well good, that is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">We should cut out the garments out of periodicals or should seek on the Internet, print out and process subsequently graphic.</seg>
<seg id="24">In the "Moodboard" how the entire result is named, should come then our entirely personal style and our relation to the graphic formation to the expression.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is namely very important, also to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.</seg>
<seg id="26">The stylist pulls the Models namely not only purely physically on, but rather also the so-called product site in the journals (after concrete specification, for example trend purses, coats, etc.) forms.</seg>
<seg id="27">Therefrom told us the stylist and designer Mario KamenÃ­k.</seg>
<seg id="28">But that first on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">That is that a stylist must have a good entire overview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">The Saturday presentation filled with information about figure types was spiced immediately by three visitors out of the industry:</seg>
<seg id="31">Of the stylist Jan PokornÃ½, of the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub remembered us that fashion illusion is and that should be a stylist able to exploit this.</seg>
<seg id="33">And sent in stylist is able to do to work with a single garment piece on entirely different manner.</seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word is named variability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">So one can lived carry for example a trenchcoat how over the jeans, therefore like a T Shirt or coat, one can carry it however also on the naked body, can dress paragraph shoes in addition and carry it as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">It passes to roll up the sleeves or the collar and immediately the entire Look sees very differently from.</seg>
<seg id="37"> "Plays therewith", emphasized it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most came lain me however the following advice: "First perfectly must know" its the rules.</seg>
<seg id="39">"First then may it it injure", said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Finally becomes clearly why we must study all these theorems, what one with what combine can and why, also to me if one gets to see other in fashion journal frequently entirely.</seg>
<seg id="41">Of fashion shows very to are quiet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I know now that a stylist must have prepared much more garment variants, than he in the end photographs.</seg>
<seg id="43">Therefore one must be prepared for a Fashion story with ten sides (sprich ten Outfits) on that, at least fifteen to stylen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also, that the garment looks on the photo in combination with further accessory sometimes very differently, than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With all that, one must calculate therefore in the formation of the Outfits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and Styl settle sometimes the half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan PokornÃ½.</seg>
<seg id="47">There one needs himself only once madonna to look at a not exactly brilliant singer, out of whom image and marketing made a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic, one stands reserves the services of a stylist sooner vis-Ã -vis.</seg>
<seg id="49">Also confessed consider personalities this frequently to be out thrown money (the essential matter is, that I something would bring, like I there would look is secondary).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if already someone lets herself of us stylen, we should calculate therewith that it or it forces us with large probability an entirely other (smaller) size, when it or it needs in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then one needs subsequently only to googlen in order to assess with security that the popular press writes, the corresponding Promi would have again to or decreased, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Jan and Mario put us on Sunday at the heart, to believe not that a stylist to focus himself only on the fashion and needs "to assemble" then the Outfit.</seg>
<seg id="53">In its work, he must communicate above all with the people, must be that he stylt and he a crafty psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">People estimate, stand without itself anzubiedern and to its opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If any manager orders us in order to sight its closet and in order to supplement pretty pieces, can clear and say we its not the entire closet - my God, that am yes terrible".</seg>
<seg id="56">"One must at least a couple of things commendable find, to which one recommends, what one in addition carry can", says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It showed us also very concretely, what must include such a so named "place pocket".</seg>
<seg id="58">Therefore so a pocket that one carries one at the waist zuknÃ¶pft and in that all necessary proprieties with itself.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Except such clear things, like scissors, Abroller to that hair distant or security needles it does not abstain also such utensils, like a nylon thread (therewith helps the stylist in the photographing of products, like purses or watching out of), special Clips, with which behind the clothing is snatched up, if it is to largely (pin or other clamps are prohibits, therewith the material broken goes) and naturally vicinity thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">So that we however not only must listen, but rather also somewhat practically try can, learned we how one really lower glues shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">Also in the photographing in the studio where the floor is even, one can damage the sole, not to mention that outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">O we glued and glued ourselves...</seg>
<seg id="63">With the scissors, one may not touch the shoes once so that one does not damage it.</seg>
<seg id="64">Therefore one must really sent advance.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario delighted me in that it praised my "creation" without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="66">The mentioned skill is namely not straight my strength.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All this was only the fraction of that what we got to hear in at the second Wochenend continuation course.</seg>
<seg id="68">One clearly became in the meantime to me - on professional level to dedicate itself to the Styling, is no children's game.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">The originally carefree trip becomes avoidable, amateurish mistake through a series totally the routine trip to the early layer.</seg>
<seg id="4">It succeeded to be sure to fulfill the ambitions to a large degree, but what that utilizes already if obviously no one was in the mood to do a little more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Already before it came on the counters, the new part woke expectations high with the subtitle "The Run".</seg>
<seg id="6">It promised yet to shift the already aged game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the game cash demonstration examples, it seemed to be actually not only an of many Action race game.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious how the fit passages fall out, in which the head protagonist climbs out of the car and goes on on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But how one it in NFS already accustomed is, is in the end effect of much differently when one had expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Certain - quite respectable arcades races are potential it, but altogether the game is lessened of some superfluous mistakes, are present that in this series more or less already a couple for year.</seg>
<seg id="10">Therefore are it actual no more mistake, but rather sooner sign of an in principle inconceivable laziness the game developer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very good.</seg>
<seg id="12">First of all one is introduced into the story, whose principle figure has Jack certain problems of personal character; the single solution seems to be, to participate in an illegal race diagonally through America.</seg>
<seg id="13">In San Francisco, therefore at the west coast, sits down one at the steering wheel - with the task of being firster in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The reason idea includes an entire row of interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The entire route is divided in ten stages and in more than fifty single races.</seg>
<seg id="16">That means that each race is expedited on other stretch and that the single stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.</seg>
<seg id="17">One has would offer no moment the impression, that game again and again the same.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Many environments yet are expressed in addition to look at lovely although the technical level of the graphics does not go out over that of the earlier parts of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">Therefore nothing Weltbewegendes.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the trip through the desert, through autumnal landscape or highly above through deeply snow-covered landscape cause visually very comfortably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">There and again atypical elements bring a little change into the single races.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert for example one is surprised of a desert storm, that strongly restricts the visibility.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains again one must pay attention infernal that one is not spilled by an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Incidentally quite well sequentially the single races are incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="25">Pass to be sure only a couple, but it.</seg>
<seg id="26">One tries a while so to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), has one time to make up (classic race against the stop clock), expects one another personal duel with a single contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And in addition also yet the police interferes, that wants to ruin one the entire thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Passages in which Jack leaves the vehicle are a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="29">At the same time it concerns sooner certain interactive animations, in which Jack escapes before any someone and must help where it the players, in that he presses the correct button in the correct moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Therefore nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It surprised to be sure that it gives much in the game fewer such passage, than one expect would become (concrete probably only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">In the end this is the thing sooner to the advantage, for so this element has at least no chance to become boringly - it belongs in the context to that above said to the elements, that more varied make the game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The load model steps in the FuÃtapfen of the previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is, of current view point seen, tears it to be sure no trees from, on the other hand could one do not maintain, it would be bad.</seg>
<seg id="35">He who seeks realistic simulation, must look around itself elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">The local load model becomes but an action loaded race load also further very well just although one could find better in the competition.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until there, all in best order is so far.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems emerge first after certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">In contrast to the load model, the collision model O. K is not entire.</seg>
<seg id="40">Of a game of this type is to be expected hardly that it calculates complicated deformation and collision, but if one has practically before no impact on any an object premonition, how the car behaves, is obviously not all in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">Typical example: In the narrow outdated or driving past "roves" accommodating car one at many places the other vehicle only easily, in other, almost identical situations comes one however into the hurling and turns wild pirouette.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or goes the carts immediately to scrap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the remainder type system, that continues to be sure nothing from, from annoying is it always.</seg>
<seg id="44">The remainder type are solved so: if one has total damage or lands far to one side of the stretch, throws one the game back at the last criterion of the stretch.</seg>
<seg id="45">Only - in every race one has only five remainder types.</seg>
<seg id="46">If one emptied it, all goes at the beginning loosely..</seg>
<seg id="47">The remainder type are not therefore sooner something akin to a remedy, for the case that somewhat does not succeed, but thereon left should itself one rather.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes helps helps however not even the remainder type, there nothing other when the critical section out of the head to learn.</seg>
<seg id="49">Expressed unpleasant is that the same things happen often at the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">One must pass through many curves for example on entirely specific type and manner, fits otherwise one simply not through.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere one meets at the corresponding place of "civil" car always in same configuration, equal whether one comes firster or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.</seg>
<seg id="52">That is especially in situations annoying if one sees, that the contractor passes by before one playing at two accommodating car, but until one arrives even there, the vehicles are already in such a position that one must bypass or brake it.</seg>
<seg id="53">And it is equal when one arrives there, everything is conceived namely so that it comes to this situation always thickly before your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The contractors have even further advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">In the entire game, there is a couple of places where one is overtaken always at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without consideration on the moment.</seg>
<seg id="56">At the displaced, this is to the conclusion of the game on the long bridge, that one happens in against direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The contractor must come overtake one here obviously on devil out.</seg>
<seg id="58">And if it is then already once before one, it takes one naturally the visibility so that one goes there at the beginning the own car a couple of time in Klump.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Clearly - the game wants to make is one simply more exciting and more exciting however this intention so clear that it one quickly the joy in the game vermiest.</seg>
<seg id="60">And that is a shame, for in spite of simpler load model, the game is altogether quite entertaining and in places also so aktionsgeladen that one knows almost no longer, where one the head stands.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in principle is is equal, what "guilt" on that - the draft with fifty unique routes, that arrangement of the races in a manner that no boredom can arise, or somewhat entirely other...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is also the vehicle change in the course of the races.</seg>
<seg id="63">One may not survey at the same time the gas station at the stretch, for just here one can change the car although in most cases the car suffices, that one just has.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are subdivided in three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are suited well for the municipal areas, the strong American saloon cars for the straight freeways and exotic super sports cars for the technical trips, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the mode of the game story goes also the tasks mode (challenges) - therefore the races in the single localities that one knows out of the story.</seg>
<seg id="67">Here there are not only medals, but rather to win also experience points for the own profile, that is joint for the tasks (challenges) and the story.</seg>
<seg id="68">In order to arrive at the higher driver level, different objects must be opened begun: by the car, up to the Backgrounds for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">This is connected simultaneously with the Online function Autolog, that among other things the own obtained results with which other player compares and provides also for further collective functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">A situation in the last race of the story is one of further incomprehensible blunders.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here one comes namely with the car into an U-train-tunnel (on my account) where one long races (on my account) in the dark on the rails.</seg>
<seg id="72">On the Tacho, figures between 150 a look comes 200 km/h (on my account), but there all at once of behind a SUBWAY and goes one uncompromising to scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorship, we will fight probably yet long about whether that was a Blackout of the game fashioners or whether the authors consider us to be so stupid.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is is nothing overwhelming however at least the visual overall impression in most cases quite impressively and here and there even brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="75">More all the more annoyinger is that in some exciting moments the picture repetition frequency becomes itself slower and this sometimes rather dramatic.</seg>
<seg id="76">That concerns however nominally the accidents with larger number of involving where one a continuous FPS utilizes anyway nothing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The tone reproduction is so far O. K. and the Soundtrack is taste thing.</seg>
<seg id="78">Address in the exertion to a scale possible as wide as only of rather young audience, emerged a Soundtrack a lÃ¡ "by everyone something" - however who buys itself such a game already because of the music?!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are mixed sooner.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game would not be lessened by the mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to maintain with the breast tone of the conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in the last years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But so the game causes somehow unfinished.</seg>
<seg id="82">At for itself a class pleasure, but one should be prepared on that that one these mistakes with the Power of airport floodlight prick into the eyes.</seg>

<seg id="1">EU ambassador VicenovÃ¡:</seg>
<seg id="2">The Czechs have the call of Negativisten and Euro skeptic</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">"The contract of Lisbon brought" the balance under the single institutions perceptible out of the Lot.</seg>
<seg id="4">I would not have expected, flare up that such a hard war".</seg>
<seg id="5">"It becomes five, six years last, until itself the wave smoothed and itself all at its new roll accustomed have become", began Milena VicenovÃ¡, the Czech ambassador in the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the juristic faculty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously it takes the motto "intelligibly and openly over Europe", it showed already in the first part of its presentation, in which it succeeded you to describe the single organs of the EU and its mutual relations on a such manageable and intelligible manner that it so many a lecturer of the juristic faculty of the Karl university can would have envy therefore.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Woman VicenovÃ¡ praised at the same time also the new permanent chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"Originally criticism became would be loud, he inconspicuously - a gray official, who had not grown such a roll, but I must say, it has all the breath cunningly how well he took on the thing.</seg>
<seg id="9">"It is a person who brings it ready to listen twenty-seven member countries patient, to communicate with them and the presentations clear above all therefrom has how it should go on with the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The new position of the high representative for foreign matters and security policy explained it then as an answer to the question: Who is that actual - the European Union? Should which number I call"?, therefore as an important step to the unification and better legibilitys of the EU politics vis-Ã -vis countries, e.g. China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">No one wants to forbid us our ÃlmÃ¼tzer Quargel</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Woman VicenovÃ¡ dedicated lived herself also the agenda, in accordance with that the European Union, lives and thought to live in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">It designated the Czech chair of two years ago as a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs would have mastered the finance crisis and the gas crisis and would have arranged also the summit meeting for eastern partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">The case of the government during the chair designated it as a large Negativum, that strongly had damaged the image of the Czech republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU has presently all hands fully to do.</seg>
<seg id="17">With the words of the ambassador said, went it not only in the chair, but rather also in the subsequent crisis, that is overcome until today not yet, quite hectically to.</seg>
<seg id="18">And there yet the seven-year-budget of the EU must be approved, what the thing makes just because of the current economic situation much complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whether it becomes a slim and thrifty budget, which branches of the economy receive precedence, which countries more and which fewer promoted become - all this stands now on the order of the day.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador reminds one also of its own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Intelligibly over Europe".</seg>
<seg id="21">"If I somewhat do not like, are it grayish shorthand symbols, foreign words and specialty jargon that no one understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">How I actually should know as a citizen whether one devises in Brussels really crooked or round cucumber and differently large bananas or whether actually someone wants to forbid us the Quargel.</seg>
<seg id="23">It would have used the ground of the EU also gladly in addition in order to got more Czechs into European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe of that two or different speeds in outlook</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Czechs in the call stand in the opinion of the EU ambassador, to be Euro skeptic, who perceive more the negative, than the positive sides of the thing.</seg>
<seg id="26">More all the more annoyinger is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">On that many factors guilt are not, among other things also the restraint of our candidates whose inabilities to write, motivation letters and finally also the weak support of the Czech side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Except the successful Czech chair, it lifted also the power and collaboration of the Visegrad group, that so-called. V4 forth.</seg>
<seg id="29">"You believe me if a pole or Ungar to me comes and is a Slowake in the vicinity, mean the Frenchman next to me: "He, what sticks its there the heads together - is that already again your V4?" and there makes a rather sour countenance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Woman according to VicenovÃ© the EU in the future expect above all hard rules for the budget politics of the member countries.</seg>
<seg id="31">As much more honest, than a "European federation" it looks at the draft of a Europe of that two or quite different speeds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">"We the countries of the Eurozone and the countries have here to one side of the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have have the Schengen room and we already the institute of a strengthened collaboration".</seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time was said that only the countries should collaborate, that want it and that that do not want it, should quietly to one side of stand".</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be more and more such institutions, runs out what in the end on a strong" Europe of the different speeds"", expects woman VicenovÃ¡.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this regard, it lauded discussed will must also the roll of the Czech republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the execution of the principle, according to that all subjects with effect on the entire EU by all member countries and not only by the countries of the Eurozone.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fire story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovator IBM steps into the second century of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If one wanted to search for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most exactly, this would be well the word "longevity".</seg>
<seg id="4">For the wide public, IBM is that synonymous for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern business although since its foundation already a century is slipped away.</seg>
<seg id="5">The base to this longevity its first boss put already - that Thomas J visionary. Watson sen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Already it represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems let easily solve themselves if the people were ready to think a little.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Its slogan "Think!" became so the trademark, around which life of the future giant should happen, (and simultaneously to the title of the proprietary periodical, that one in IBM already in 1935 to publish began).</seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the base of the business culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.</seg>
<seg id="9">"For us out of IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement toward the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also therefore an entire century successfully because it faithfully remained to its principles and back did not frighten before that to change all other all around.</seg>
<seg id="11">That permitted us to transform in the course of our first century, the technologies, the business and also the company.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope, create that we in the next hundred years yet more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the business out of occasion of the anniversary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thought out system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson operated already social care of its employed in the thirties years - in similar manner, like the entrepreneur in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had paid vacation, an insurance as one of the first American employed through the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as a work garment and a thought out remuneration system for best innovator and dealer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Just as contrived are also the long-term relations of IBM with its customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The business was from the beginning brilliantly in the talent support - as one of the first firms worldwide lifted IBM each discrimination on - and accordingly was able to choose itself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In harmony with this antidiscrimination strategy, also the present plan, the Palmisan is alternated becomes at the tip by IBM in the next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">That is took in already thirty years in IBM there, previously it the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing boss and strategy boss.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM makes so-called Online brainstormings in the last years, out of which many future strategies and innovations maturely.</seg>
<seg id="20">No wonder - there are is busied ideas enough, in the business almost a half million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with good call</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Your imperturbable position in the business guarantees the business a strong image and according to this interior and outward.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the beginning had IBM sooner the draft of an institution, than a bare technology business", said Economist the professor of the Harvard businesses School and the author of a beech over IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is no technology business, but rather a firm, the business problems with the help of of technologies solve helps", joined George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research thereto.</seg>
<seg id="25">How the business itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be on the market only presently or to form it through this presence directly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - in because of the countries of its Logos informally "Big Blue" named, is grown up in a century to one of the largest businesses of the world.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the most multilateral technologies businesses generally - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation achievements in an incredible product width - from servers to there to the nano technology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of all technology business of American IBM possesses were priced most patents and already five of its colleagues with the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">To its best known inventions, for example bank vending machines, credit cards, finance wap, stroke code or also the diskette belong.</seg>
<seg id="30">With ca. IBM was 220 billions of dollar stock exchange value (market capitalization) this year the second largest technology business (same after Apple) whereby it overtook for the first time since 1996 Microsofts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The view ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">All products and innovations did not encounter the taste of the customers of today - unfortunately were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the Online services Prodigy or also the computers IBM PC jr.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Business is based on the forward movement, therefore may one itself not emotionally at the past bind", means in addition Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore IBM has no problem to build its reason wall on different platforms - and if they do not function to leave it also again.</seg>
<seg id="35">In contrast to the opponent Microsoft that in principle with its operating system Windows stands and falls.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technologies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">At the profits of IBM take part involve in largest mass of services, software and hardware itself to respectively one-fifth.</seg>
<seg id="38">At the same time was represented yet 1990 hardware with a more than fifty percent share in the strongest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000 IBM little profit sold invested assets throwing off in the value of 15 billion dollars, in which same time it however 58 billions of dollar of technologies seminal into the purchase.</seg>
<seg id="40">In this Investionen, IBM continues also after 2008 when the modern finance crisis swept for the first time such as a storm over the world.</seg>
<seg id="41">Also here IBM remained the legacy of its first boss Thomas J. Watson faithful, that middle in the large world economic crisis its investment circumference increased.</seg>
<seg id="42">Previously it seems that the business overcomes IBM the current crisis in spite of.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rockets-like around 120 percent and the net profit of the business are awake kontinuell.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The business slogan of IBM reads: everything can be changed - only the values not.</seg>
<seg id="45">Also therefore may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM story: Of the cheese tailor to universe flights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The company established one hundred years ago in New York IBM (internationally business Machines) had at the beginning a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">It received originally concerned the name IBM first 1924 - it a brand-name label for an agency in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The fusion of four businesses, whose story go back into the 80 to years of the 19th century, put the cornerstone to the later company IBM.</seg>
<seg id="50">They possessed technologies such as for example the famous Stechkartenuhren to the registration of the work start and -endes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">To the architect of this new business, Charles Ranlett Flint, that had also the chair in the supervisory board until 1930 in, became.</seg>
<seg id="52">And it was Flint, that the boss of the rival company Thomas J. Watson adjusted so that it this helped in the direction of the business.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Leader placed then even the founders of IBM in the shadow - on Watson's it ideas is based until today the invincible culture and identity of the business.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the business until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM, began how already the name betrays, with the manufacture and the sales and marketing of all possible machines for the trade - of sausage and cheese tailors, up to cash registers.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four decades, in which Watson led the firm, it doubled its revenues on nine million dollars and the business expanded gradually on all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was for the firm so indispensable that it sat entire for forty years in the boss armchair, first then became it of its son, Thomas Watson junior removed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under whose direction IBM began to work at the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first programming language.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the '60's technician and computer of IBM of the NASA flights in that helped all to lead - to the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of the person to the moon.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile IBM in 1964 developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the row IBM system/360.</seg>
<seg id="61">A classic PC, that determined the computer standard of that time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.</seg>
<seg id="62">IBM later sold twenty years its computer production at the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand it bought however the consul aunt part of the business PricewaterhouseCoopers and climbed with this fully and entirely into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high value-added on.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, that itself IBM in the last three years pays is the draft "Smarter planet".</seg>
<seg id="64">It embodies the intention to use technologies in smart manner in not yet once planned areas, for example also to the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the city administration.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the trade sector, IBM introduced recently the platforms "Smarter commerces", that should help the dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM has a strong story also in the Czech Republic.</seg>
<seg id="67">IBM established already 1932 an agency in the at that time Czechoslovakia - as a generally first country in central Europe and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today IBM operates among other things also a strategic Outsourcing center in BrÃ¼nn.</seg>
<seg id="69">The headquarters for central Europe and Eastern Europe settles in Prague and here is also a Top researcher team of world level that with the technology of the voice recognition is concerned.</seg>

<seg id="1">Development of the trip prices since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, it gave in the travel agency at that time only five allowed national: Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The travel agencies of sold at that time above all solely trips into the socialistic Eastern bloc countries, into the west might at that time only selected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And so Czech tourists traveled at the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), into the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the peninsula rummaged at the black sea), to Bulgaria and Rumania at the black sea and to Hungary at the Balaton.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A light exception was the period of 1962 to 1972 when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, hit Yugoslavia a per western course and therefore the trips strongly were restricted to Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">A large paradoxically those socialistic times it was that it was not permitted once citizens of the Eastern bloc (therefore also the Tschechoslowaken) to travel in the frame of the socialistic countries freely.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen of that wanted to travel for example individually to Poland or quite into the Soviet Union, he did not need were in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Already at that time the travel agencies also trips offered into the west, had to take one however gigantic snakes in purchase or spend the night also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, and/or at least "good acquaintance" in the travel agency have.</seg>
<seg id="9">Also so the thing had not run yet long.</seg>
<seg id="10">That so-called. Foreign currency promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was given only "politically dependable" people - the other were allowed to travel not at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The Czechoslovakian currency was would have been impossible namely no free exchange cash currency, without foreign currency promise it therefore to find the necessary finance means (western currency) for a trip into the west.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The from afar most Czechs of spent therefore its vacation in the inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought themselves chateaus innumerable and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">A trip revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 on the foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">While until 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs in the past year 4.5 million of its foreign vacation spent into countries of the entire world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A powerful paradoxically, whose one is aware himself today not at all more, the fact is that one was not able to travel into the presently most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 at all, because it was part of the at that time Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Same of the start of the '90's of the past century at the foreign currency duty was canceled into the neighboring west european countries, what evoked a powerful wave of short visit above all to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken were not able to get long time of its trips into the west simply enough, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of day there.</seg>
<seg id="18">So the Czech vacationers slept in trips to Paris in the tent in the park, for who would have had at that time already the money for a lodging in the hotel or in a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature in trips abroad of Czechs was at that time a with canned food, beer and hard sausage etc. of full thrilling trunk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">A further important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchange cash Czech crown - after decades finally freely were able to shop itself our tourists the western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our life level and hereby also the average salaries increased, what flowed 1997 into a further important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demands after trips, the travel agencies began to prepare trips after 1997 regularly through charter flights by what means the flight trips to negotiate thanks to the possibility, bulk discounts, in comparison with the past incredibly reduced in price.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The Czechs had end of the '90's, with exception of the USA, already foreigncurrencyless payment traffic with all advanced countries of the world, what made the traveling even simpler.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">To a further interesting moment in the story of the "postal service samtenen of" holiday traffic it came in 2000 when thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight was dispatched into an exotic country - to Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since then annually direct charters airplanes with Czech passengers in far fly removed sunny countries; this year one flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations on.</seg>
<seg id="26">At the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually into exotic countries!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">A further important moment in the epoch, that our "postal service marked revolutionary" development, came in the year 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On the 17th of November 2008, the visa duty canceled the USA for Czech tourists by what means our country joined definitively under the advanced countries of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008 spent the Czechs for the first time more than the half of its vacation abroad (50,3%) and for the first time in its story they gave inclusive of the costs for a single vacation stay at the vacation place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head from.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The general meeting should find a new chairperson - again threatens a stalemate.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Already almost for five months, the Czech soccer has no chairperson and at the same time threatens that the successor will not be of Ivan HaÅ¡ek at the tip of the Czech soccer association once after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday well known in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until today, there is namely yet no unification about that, after which election regulation selected will should.</seg>
<seg id="4">And without this, no voting is generally possible over the three potential successors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties would like to manage the Czech soccer - Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and TomÃ¡ PaclÃ­k.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June HaÅ¡ek of its function resigned whereby it had requested its colleagues in the retirement in addition to agree and to find a strong personality, that could lead the soccer in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only - in the era after HaÅ¡ek the old arguments between both association chambers broke out again, that cannot agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This appeared plainly and clearly on the 16th of September when the new chairperson should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegated of the general meeting had come very for nothing into the people house in the citizen of Prague quarter SmÃ­chov, for the negotiation led to no result and at the same time it concerned not only the choice itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">One was able to agree namely not even about that, is who in the full collection actual stimmberechtigt - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries equipped with an authority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point, one obtained at least partially unification why also the recommendation of the institute contributed for country and right, whose opinion would not be after a representation admissible on authority basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">The disputes around the election regulation last however further.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Also the Exekutivausschuss brought no longer clarity into the thing, in whose sessions - equal, whether orderly or extraordinary - in principle generally does nothing stand other more on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also if the views changed with regard to the choice a couple of time - the neuralgic point remained the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">Does the question read: how one should advance in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate situation?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The issue concerns the question, whether one in agreement with the statute advance should, or whether an entirely other model found will must", placed you at Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairperson the firmly, that represents the pro soccer in the management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to statutory model, that candidate, who receives the larger prozentuelle support in the chamber, wins in the third round, for which he runs for office.</seg>
<seg id="18">MÃ¤hren is nominally ready to go in on the compromise that that candidate wins, who receives the higher number of votes out of both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side again insists on the condition that the victor receives at least a two-thirds majority in this prozentuellen voice counting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"Then have both preliminaries generally no sense more, this mode would become the entire bicameral draft in question place", understands Svoboda the objections of the mÃ¤hrischen side that it would find best, that thereto do not bend election regulation, but rather to select according to valid statute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Surprisingly also TomÃ¡ PaclÃ­k agrees that, also if is outlined, that the statutory election regulation of all candidates comes at that soon probably contrary to Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is "my wish that most extensive after the statute selected becomes".</seg>
<seg id="23">"Therewith no absurd replacement variants contrived become, how in the last general meeting", declared of the owners (the soccer club) Victoria of that for the first time runs for office and delimited itself in its attitudes above all vis-Ã -vis Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains however optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">According to its opinion the new chairperson will be well known in Nymburk and believes he that the candidates in the future will collaborate also constructive.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification of the national team for the soccer EM at the current day would contribute" certainly to calming of the minds.</seg>
<seg id="27">"If the soccer first on the euphoric wave rides, is also the readiness for the collaboration larger", means the functionary out of Jablonec, that of all three Adepten the largest experiences brings along, and this both on professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is there more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope for a unification, but the situation is unfortunately conflicting".</seg>
<seg id="30">"That is no thing between the people out of bohemian and MÃ¤hren, but there are bend right certain efforts, the directions to own purposes""."</seg>
<seg id="31">A renewed blockage "therefore is not excluded" in the general meeting.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope however, that the healthy common sense in the end wins", said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Only - much time to the agreement of all sides remains no longer.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should happen nominally directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the FuÃballgeneralitÃ¤t will be generally complete to the qualification game.</seg>
<seg id="35">The charter airplane, with which among other things Dalibor and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, was able to start searched at the morning in Prague because of a technical interference not at all and so one feverishly for a replacement variant to bring a part of the executive committee like one yet yet at the venue of the bar rage away game.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In the end is then yet well the meeting on minister plain decisively, to which it should come nominally on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Josef DobeÅ¡, the minister for school system, youth and body upbringing would have moved the split parties within the largest sport association of the country gladly to a unification.</seg>
<seg id="38">Much stands namely on the game: national grants that VertrauungswÃ¼rdigkeit of the Czech soccer and also the standing general meeting should the that the Czech sport after the finance problems of Sazka the new direction of wise.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">PaclÃ­k goes into the fight for the position of the chairperson because he sees no suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If TomÃ¡ PaclÃ­k, that boss of the Pilsner soccer players would have been able to settle a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all its presentations over the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, he would not have gotten involved at all with the fight for this top position.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there were a good applicant, I would fight for it and forgo" the choice.</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the present situation succeeded it not, such an Adepten to find", said PaclÃ­k.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for PaclÃ­k to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Rajchl, is to be prevented it therefore that the alleged favorite of the choice, Pelta at which tip arrives the.</seg>
<seg id="44">PaclÃ­k emphasizes also that it thought to exercise the function of the chairpeople in the case its victory only a year, therefore until 2013, to the appointment the general meeting orderly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of the chairperson, he would have learned seen gladly one Top manager, who is not entangled all too very into the soccer events.</seg>
<seg id="46">"With some people coming in question, I personally spoke".</seg>
<seg id="47">To believe "hardly that some said me, it did not want to identify itself presently with the Czech soccer.</seg>
<seg id="48"> "Such views gladly would have changed", led it on.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Most of everything, PaclÃ­k disturbs nominally the connection Pelta's it with the chairperson of the Pilsner of district soccer association novel Berbr, a man with controversial call, who counts behind the scenery as a powerful lobbyist, to influence with the capacity, Delegiertenabstimmungen on general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="50">For PaclÃ­k, it is for this reason unacceptable that Pelta would have the position of the chairpeople in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"In its victory, the current condition would be preserved on and in the Czech soccer, it would not go at all ahead".</seg>
<seg id="52">"The support through Berbr, a clever Businessman, would get the soccer doubly badly", emphasized PaclÃ­k.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">With this it alludes also on that that Pelta's it name fell some time ago in connection with TelefonabhÃ¶rungen to the ascertainment in a corruption affaire, out of which Pelta followed however exempt.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I does not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta that (tsch.) Soccer bring in should".</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how would become we in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA stand there", said PaclÃ­k, that its earlier statement, "it would become the Pilsner soccer club sell, if Pelta chairperson would become", but already something calm sees.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">If PaclÃ­k in the Thursday choice should win, he thoroughly could imagine however a future collaboration with Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Just as also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl, that PaclÃ­k had supported before the general meeting in October, that ended with a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"It (Pelta) would be go would become" the first, that I.</seg>
<seg id="59">"It has large capacities".</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could introduce" me it well for example as a boss of the national team.</seg>
<seg id="61">"But I do not believe that it is able, to lead" the association as a manager.</seg>
<seg id="62">"I stick my nose yet not in matters, of which I would nothing understand", said PaclÃ­k, that had provided in September therewith for sensation, that it stood behind the recall of the arbitrator commission with Macela at the tip, that Dagmar DamkovÃ¡ replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">PaclÃ­k itself maintains, it would feel grown the roll of the association chairpeople.</seg>
<seg id="64">And has called at the same time on its capacities in the direction of private firms, for past summer is itself it also boss of Pilsen who celebrated with its support in May the first triumph in the league.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the Power in addition to change something in the soccer milieu and to contribute" to one certain cultivation of this.</seg>
<seg id="66">"Around the influence of certain interest groups to restrict, that in addition tend, disciplineed commissions and calling commissions to influence, what into repulsive situations degenerates", cited PaclÃ­k, that makes no Hehl out of its antipathy for example vis-Ã -vis the Sparta boss Daniel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one its priorities it would look at the establishment of the relations between that and the Czech Olympia committee, with whose aid it would become lobbyieren at the political tip politicians for that, that more money flows out of the lottery tax into the sport.</seg>
<seg id="68">"That is one of the decisive things which the new chairperson should" dedicate itself.</seg>
<seg id="69">"If it to the taxation of games of chance comes, how the political parties declare, grasp I its argumentation, must it however also plainly and clearly say, where the money goes", said it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Its connection to the Pilsner club does not look at PaclÃ­k either as a Handicap although he himself emphasizes, the chairperson the would must "non-partisan" be.</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta again is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the citizen of Prague Dukla.</seg>
<seg id="72">"That is not exactly ideal".</seg>
<seg id="73">"It makes my opinion however also not much sense, my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritical on a third person to transmit, around after one and a half years again to return", placed PaclÃ­k clearly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised would exclude new statutes the the one stalemate situation in the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">One of the candidates promised strongly would make itself two days before the general meeting of the soccer association for the Vorsitzendenamt, namely Miroslav Pelta, he in the case its choice for that that the new Statute gets, that in the future disputes exclude over the election regulation from the start.</seg>
<seg id="76">The functionary out of Jablonec is the Thursday ago negotiation in Nymburk confident and believes, the campaign certainly would defuse itself in a possible success of the Czech selection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta had promised already before the not realized choice in September, he wanted concentrate in the case its choice on the national team and the winning of finance means.</seg>
<seg id="78">He decided liked to help first on the last moment to be involved in the choice before the last general meeting and so it the two-month recess to defend its presentations over the direction of the soccer and to introduce in a wider context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People on all levels dedicate themselves to the soccer, they are impatient and expect therefore that the chairperson will be" on Thursday well known.</seg>
<seg id="80">"It feels that it is highest time, that the association is led by someone, means the man, who is connected above all with the Jablonecer club, that acted however also many years in Sparta and in the Exekutivausschuss.</seg>
<seg id="81">Also therefore it means that it would control sufficient experiences in order to lead the Czech soccer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">It is convinced that for the current problems with the choice the euphoria is responsible, that at times of Ivan HaÅ¡ek ruled.</seg>
<seg id="83">"Unfortunately statutes were approved in the general meeting in June, were not so perfect that how it had supposed everyone.</seg>
<seg id="84">If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had as of September already a chairperson", meant Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">It used just the revision of the most important document of the citizen union as an enticement for the delegated.</seg>
<seg id="86">I "should become chairperson, I take myself its personally on and am to bear ready personally responsibility if it out" does not work.</seg>
<seg id="87">"That is a fundamental thing, without that it be not can", maintains Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In the further, he does not try to delimit himself vis-Ã -vis its contractors.</seg>
<seg id="89">Already earlier it had announced, could imagine it a collaboration with Rajchl, that it acknowledges because of its juristic development and good knows it, that its against candidate would be its first representative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">It attacked also TomÃ¡ PaclÃ­k already long no longer, let that again no dry thread at Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">In the soccer moved he herself already over a year and can refer already to certain successes".</seg>
<seg id="92">"Its attacks were however reducing and many people were of its choice campaign shocked".</seg>
<seg id="93">"Also therefore doubt now many its actual character", addressed Pelta its contractor, that would remain well faithful to its Proklamierungen, that it already in September expressed have.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">According to its opinion its strongest weapon is the knowledge of the soccer of the lowest game classes, up to the national team.</seg>
<seg id="95">And this should be the hallmark of Czech soccer.</seg>
<seg id="96">"I would strive me also therefore to conclude all affaires - of the Causa Bohemians, up to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of the past year".</seg>
<seg id="97">"Equally after that would become I me on negotiations with the private and national sector fall, around sufficient finance means for the entire soccer to guarantee", said the six and forty year old candidate two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">At that time it promised also that its entrance would mean no personnel cleansings into the tip of the Czech soccer.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I must me first once with the work contents of all employed trusted make", said it toward Strahov where based on the long anarchy understandably nervousness rules.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">In spite of the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the standing general meeting, it believes that the delegated do not go to the Thursday for nothing to Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If actual the single debatable point should be, how one selects in the third round, let's come about that away".</seg>
<seg id="102">"The soccer needs credibility and that wins it only through it back, if it finally a new Leader has", remains Pelta two days the possibly decisive day ago its functionary career optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that that begins to work under it hard</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">If the previous deputy chairperson Rajchl should be selected on the general meeting on Thursday to the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech republic, this would become alleged many people in the association the mood vermiesen.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises namely that one would begin to work in the case its choice hard.</seg>
<seg id="106">It wants to introduce system changes and responsibly wants to make the members of the executive committee for single soccer areas.</seg>
<seg id="107">Moreover it promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relations to the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and to continue otherwise the work, that the prior presiding Ivan HaÅ¡ek began.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As chairperson, I would like to dedicate" myself the soccer as entire.</seg>
<seg id="109">Begun of the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, over the national selection, the professional soccer, up to the achievement soccer for the youth".</seg>
<seg id="110">"Therewith wants I do not say, that I all alone make wants", said Rajchl in the conversation for.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the competences in the Exekutivausschuss so that each member dedicates" herself one certain to area.</seg>
<seg id="112">And I will distribute hard tasks, make headway so that the soccer in every segment with mile step".</seg>
<seg id="113">About that many would not be charmed just because they to criticize, instead of only the work of other to work now even really hard begin must", joined it thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement had pulled in deliberation to not to run for office more at all.</seg>
<seg id="115">"Of me is well known that I work" 20 hours at the day.</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I must know, that it sense makes and that people behind me stand, that me not incessantly club between the legs throw and every step, that I make, in question place", said he as an explanation why he had hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people said however that I would not be allowed to abandon, to me because it would become" do otherwise also others.</seg>
<seg id="118">"That is confidence, that one do not lose may", said it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">Nominally motivates it also to be allowed to continue the work, that it began under HaÅ¡ek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"In two years, we mastered a large piece of work and not simply want to throw away" that I now.</seg>
<seg id="121">"It became processes started, that probably not until a couple of years the validity come and I only unwillingly would see, that it someone stop", it meant and expresses with this its objections that for the case, that the other candidate would be selected himself - Miroslav Pelta, that could return situation into the times before HaÅ¡ek.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe is in systematic action and that somewhat, what does not bring" Mirek Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind it, people who would make the soccer so stand above all, that he would be" selected only for there.</seg>
<seg id="124">One can reproach probably a few things for me, but would be partial not, that I".</seg>
<seg id="125">"I strive me, objectively to its".</seg>
<seg id="126">"I wants soccer for everyone, because it then all well goes and not only that selected", noted Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It contradicts also the statement, let it be only a chairperson of the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Also if many people maintain the opposite to do" I have really before, the optimum for MÃ¤hren.</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example it is to be considered time whether one should not subdivide the league in a Czech and a mÃ¤hrischen part, whose winners climbed" then respectively into the first league.</seg>
<seg id="130">"Then could it do not happen, that today only three mÃ¤hrische club in the league play, what especially for the young players in MÃ¤hren a problem is", means Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club TomÃ¡ PaclÃ­k joined to the fight for the function of the chairperson, Rajchl does not trust itself to estimate its chances that he is selected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I perceive a strong support in the Czech chamber, that me to its deputy chairperson selected has and now recognizes, that clear successes behind me stand", cited Rajchl, that also the savings of hesitated millions crowns for unfavorable contracts, that looks at agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as its success.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand he gives himself in part the guilt that the association does not pull at a single cord.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While it says of Pelta, "it would be from the start disqualifies, the Czech soccer to new confidence in to help", holds it the second rival - PaclÃ­k for a strong candidate, who has to offer really something to the soccer.</seg>
<seg id="135">"No one can question that it has" performed excellent work in Pilsen into only a year.</seg>
<seg id="136">"Should it selected become, would become it probably the things continue, that Ivan HaÅ¡ek initiated has and also the personnel occupation in the commissions would become it obviously not basically change".</seg>
<seg id="137">It would not want to bend there the things certainly to its favor", judges Rajchl over its rival.</seg>

<seg id="5">A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If iris Meder in the past one and a half years went on investigation trip, one in its baggage was not allowed to be missing: its bathing suit.</seg>
<seg id="7">Backwards on the water lying, looked it highly in skillful formed procuring, it swam toward marble Putten, that at the basin edge at it waited, and marveled over meticulously restored art nouveau floating halls.</seg>
<seg id="8">If a bath pleased it, took it it flight into its notebook on - including interesting detail over the method of building and story of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Architecture historian explored more than 200 swimming pools Meder in this manner - and she introduces now "bath joys" in its just appeared book: People floating halls in Munich, historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore Betonbauten" in the Taunus.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Through 13 countries, it led its "trip to the most extraordinary baths in central Europe" : Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, the Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Rumania, Poland - and respectively a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">A true bath culture enthusiast is the 46-year-old Germans.</seg>
<seg id="12">With sport, it has not much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water would be that differently.</seg>
<seg id="13">Annoying only that floating fans with blue tiles and chlorine stench must come to terms, while joggers can inhale the betÃ¶renden aroma of spruce forests or can listen cheerful bird twitter in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"I have me one day asked, why swimming pools actually always so ugly its must", says the Meder living in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">I "therefore began to gather" beautiful baths.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Water surface doubles architecture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">GeplÃ¤tscher in the leap basin and ethereal saunas oils - the wellness factor in baths would be therefore so large because all senses are served, so Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builder effort gave itself, floating halls can be a true eye feast: "Instead of a floor, one has a water surface" in baths.</seg>
<seg id="19">"You is on the one hand transparent, reflects on the other hand however the beauty of the entire building against".</seg>
<seg id="20">Everything doubles itself optically: high vaults, colorful tile, leap boards.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The kleinformatige picture volume "bath joys" mediates interesting on 190 sides over the architecture story and culture story of historic wellnesses oases - makes however above all desire on a leap into the blue.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable copies in its investigations in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">SzÃ©chenyi bath of old next to grand well-being baths such as the 100 years in Budapest found it a nitrate containing waters in an urigen KarsthÃ¶hle (cave bath in Miskolc Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, whose basins with alkali containing water are filled and be in a bottle-shaped building, (VÃ¡rosi TermÃ¡lfÃ¼rdÃ¶ in JÃ¡szberÃ©ny).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Spectacular outlooks on the other hand offer many heated outdoor swimming-pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the entire city of the ZÃ¼richer roof bath in mind, one can look in the outside pool of a bath in St. Anton at the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath, there is a window out of which one can observe the driving on the ski track.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The pool design most extraordinary perhaps expects bath guests in length field: The Aquadome Ãtztal looks like a UFO landed just in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="26">Out of three towards the top open scarves, it steams in the winter while in the background the mountains of the Ãtztals jut into the sky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Alhambra in the Black Forest</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder did not climb the smell of chlorine into the nose.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal baths smell stink after sulfur, in the ÃrpÃ¡d bath in the Hungarian BÃ©kescsaba it so strongly after heating oil, that one does hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes of the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen well-being water, that almost blackly is and whose ooze glues one at the skin, as soon as one can be glided into the basin - a wellness experience of the special type.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">At a place, iris Meder was disappointed on its search for beautiful bath places however also: When it wanted to visit the freely bath and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it found a closed off grounds.</seg>
<seg id="32">Bath formed was closed that 1902 of the architect you at Jurkovic in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a Meder a view through that windows weathered knows threw the red--yellow art nouveau building, saw it how weeds proliferated between the tiles.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">The decay worked against has one on the other hand in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the palace thermal in bath wild bath.</seg>
<seg id="35">This bath has three building phases already behind itself; discover one cannot only neoromanische elements, that come from times of its erection in 1844, but rather also a maurische hall in the Alhambra style that was added around 1900.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Since the careful modernization 1995 is the palaces thermal the favorite bath of the pool connoisseur iris Meder - and that not only because she comes originally from the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It is already an achievement, so different architectural styles to one so romp about unit to fuse", says Meder.</seg>
<seg id="38">In such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is evidently only minor matter.</seg>

<seg id="3">Of Ingeborg Wiensowski</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">An architecture story with heights, depths and Happy End: The Austrian World Fair pavilion of Brussels 1958 obtained prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood empty and degenerated.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now it will reopen as a display house.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If by more in more a more modern more manner post-war architecture is enthused, of clear forms, glass halls, courageous would swing and believe in are new building materials, that typical for that the technical progress, is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl of tails for the BrÃ¼ssler World Fair 1958 an appropriate and famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Schwanzers pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d' architecture for its easily and floating causing steel-glass-construction.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building counts until today as a milestone of contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">It made the architect so well known that that constructed pavilion also in the next World Fair of Austria.</seg>
<seg id="10">With its legendary BMW four cylinder house plus bowl-like next to building in Munich, it became 1973 in the end internationally famous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Its as pavilion planned temporarily display building one had set up garden to the World Fair in the Swiss in the Viennese south railway station, had rebuilt and opens 1962 therein a museum of the 20th century - the "20 house" was named it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Suited was the building however neither spatial and technical as museum - no walls to the hanging the art, no good climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001 the building has stood empty and came down more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect rebuilt Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, is named he now "21 house" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday evening opens the museum Belvedere to which the house belongs, there the first display - a windfall in every regard.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Put through has Agnes Husslein Arco, that became 2007 new director the Austrian gallery Belvedere, the new beginning.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein Arco, graduated art historian with notable career among other things in the youth as an EiskunstlÃ¤ufererin, later in Sotheby's it, that Guggenheim museum and as a foundation director of the museum the Salzburg modern, put through the reconstruction emphatically with politicians and DenkmalschÃ¼tzern, it procured public means and private sponsor moneys and determined the utilization.</seg>
<seg id="19">Except present art should be issued the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the of the same name foundation, should be a cafÃ© and a bookshop there, and an office house had to be constructed in addition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Severe supervision, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">For the execution, Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only, because he rebuilt Joseph Olbrichs sec meal ion in Vienna sensitive, and expands and won had the competition, but rather because he studied in tails at the technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for it an "enormously important place", at which he had looked at "almost each weekend" the displays.</seg>
<seg id="23">It knew the original design, and it knew the problems of the building that lost already in its transfer to Vienna and its repurposing at generosity and lightness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">In the present reconstruction, there were far larger problems: The building was "an energy sling", says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, were used optical fiber reinforced insulating glass and replaces the glass roof by special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Cold bridges steel girders were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos filled covers were rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two first floors brought place for the new utilization, a layered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still the easy tail pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The originals outside doors remained, that painted is house in the old reddish brown rustproofing shade.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the movie theater hall is even yet very exactly so how it was earlier.</seg>
<seg id="30">And that of all under severe supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often must a material found become, that well is and approve is and also the historical preservation office pleased", Krischanitz says and shows on a ruppigen ground in the first floor there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">In spite of all compulsions, problem and rebuilt is the building flexible and easy remained.</seg>
<seg id="33">It would be difficult been with the pavilion, "that from Brussels came therefore", said Krischanitz recently, a typical âDrop-in-the-City-Geschichte".</seg>
<seg id="34">So an architecture stands "always at the incorrect place" and wanted awake" nevertheless "a correct consciousness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the 21 is not house however at the incorrect place, for a city structural windfall entered: Around the Swiss garden around just the "central station quarters" newly planned totally emerge, with office and dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another windfall yet will enter perhaps: The 21 house could get strengthening of one other Krischanitz building, for the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought hears the Berliners temporarily art hall, and how one, negotiated it already with the city around a neighborly location in the Swiss garden.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">After the disclosure of the "Zwickauer cell", Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks quite about one "bloody ideology" that would revive now again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The murders at eight Turkish sturdy and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.</seg>
<seg id="5">On this message is reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with anxiety and worry.</seg>
<seg id="6">For for many Germans Turks, an a long time dead believed ghost returns therewith: Since the fire attacks in MÃ¶lln in November 1992 and in solo gene in May 1993 there were no comparable force with right-wing extremist background more against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That there is hostility towards foreigners in Germany, never stood nevertheless in question.</seg>
<seg id="8">The uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals however sizes whose dimension is yet by far foreseeable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Does the bloody ideology "live again on"? titled the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand emphasizes that one of the culprits is supposed to have been a V man of the constitution protection, and appears provides that also German authorities could be involved into the radical right-wing swamp.</seg>
<seg id="11">Prudently community Germany reacted the Turkish: It reminded one of the weekend with a warn watch before the Brandenburg Gate at the victims of racist force.</seg>
<seg id="12">First two weeks before community in Berlin had thought the Turkish jointly with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.</seg>
<seg id="13">In cheerful colors, living and working together had been produced - as a story of the success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">How a slap the reporting of some Turkish media causes there: The heading of an article in the Turkish Internet platform reads "Germany gift to the fiftieth" "Haber X" that the backgrounds of the murder series reports.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also the Germany edition of the "HÃ¼rriyet" does not let itself take it to pull this intellectual connection.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It catches on to stink", is named the title of the column of Ahmet KÃ¼lahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">It emphasizes therein that people had been murdered, who would have paid taxes and would have performed with its work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.</seg>
<seg id="18">Extremely critically the action of the police and its late search success is discussed in German Turkish Internet forums.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why it had not occurred already much sooner to the German authorities, to search in right-wing extremist circles for suspects, the authors are surprised.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many one appears at least rhetorical to drastic means ready: "Here further is been sloppy, remains the migrant nothing other remaining as the self-defense and the armament".</seg>
<seg id="21">Probably the best self-protection will be" "that.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Of the goodness of the clarification and appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network hangs very strongly the internal peace in Germany from", writes "selenium".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The attacks of MÃ¶lln and solo gene in the nineties clarified what means if the internal peace in Germany in danger is.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photo of the fire ruins of solo gene deeply is anchored in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">For no other event showed the Turk living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and can flow the Germans, that mistrust and distance in right force.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks sharpened however the we feeling on Turkish side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Do not repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press, the failure of the German politics was criticized at that time above all after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused, who to visit surviving of MÃ¶lln.</seg>

<seg id="30">Very so, as the value of a person calculates itself after the height of its tax duty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The present reporting of the Turkish media shows again once how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is into the local rule of law since then.</seg>

<seg id="1">The scandal bank of the ZÃ¼risee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The adventurousest bank of Europe does not sit in Italy or France, but rather in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS went in the finance crisis almost bankrupt and slides since then of a crisis in the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now it should arrange a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So it not certainly had thought itself Axel weaver.</seg>
<seg id="6">After its spectacular departure of the tip of the German Federal Bank was acquaintance become in July that it would begin 2013 a nearly just as spectacular new job: Supervisory board president of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel weaver was happy publicly, praised Switzerland whether its beauty and the UBS whether its newly won solidity and let fall friendly comments over the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"The UBS created" the Turnaround.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I please me on the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald GrÃ¼bel".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Yet already in September became clear that all would come very differently.</seg>
<seg id="11">A dealer of the UBS in London had gone around all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billions of Euro verzockt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS chief executive Oswald GrÃ¼bel, a not only in Switzerland of praised bank, had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The supervisory board president of the UBS counts since then also as struck - and ask everyone: When does Axel weaver come finally?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Already became well known that weaver may advise the bank of February 2012 at.</seg>
<seg id="15">It receives and the supervisory board chair already in May - not first in 2013 how the bank announced on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">For Axel weaver, that becomes hard.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is no bank, rather economy professor and central banker and certainly compel would have had a training period.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a blow, it accepts then the responsibility for the strategy of a bank, that proved just now once again, that it earns a long time the title scandal bank of Europe" "largest.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the UBS is on the one hand tremendously - until recently was it the largest asset manager of the world - and has slid on the other hand for years of a scandal in the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, seems it, remains the once so proud Swiss bank saved.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It began in the finance crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the concealed and solid, but also ausgebufften of Swiss asset manager it had combined with ambitious goals: It wanted to become an entirely large number also in the Investmentbanking.</seg>
<seg id="24">So the UBS 2007 administered on the one hand more money of being able to do customers with 1.6 trillion dollar than each other bank of the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank into the league of the largest banks of the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">That made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The bank former and later long-time bank professors in Zurich Hans violinist tells: I placed" "my student the UBS at that time always as a pattern of a good bank.</seg>
<seg id="28">"From current point of view one asks himself: How was I able to be mistaken only so"?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">It was mistaken powerfully.</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2007 became for the first time obvious that somewhat proper in the UBS sloping ran.</seg>
<seg id="31">Middle of the year resigned chief executive Peter Wuffli surprisingly, that counted until there as more highly more intellectual and just as brilliant bank.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later one suspected why it had gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Investmentsparte of the bank had itself with verzockt Subprime paper and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to shoulder that, the UBS announced an increase in capital in height of would say and would write 13 billions of franc.</seg>
<seg id="35">For that it found still would have actually investors, to be sure which, over that of many an until shortly before the nose gerÃ¼mpft: an opaque Asian country fund from Singapore and an Arabic country fund that was concealed so, that one did not learn once its name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Yet that was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">It came in April 2008 more badly.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce new billion losses, supervisory board president Marcel Ospel, 2006 yet of that at the second-best paid supervisory board of Switzerland, stepped back.</seg>
<seg id="39">The catastrophe followed in October 2008: The UBS stood in view of its misinvestment in the finance crisis before the breakdown and had to be rescued by the country.</seg>
<seg id="40">The national bank bought the UBS for hesitated billions of problematic securities, the Swiss confederacy gave become could six billions of franc for a compulsion change loan, over that it co-owner of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The entire Switzerland was shaken - then it noted how dramatic it is for a small country, if it harbors so large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the end the balance sum of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphics).</seg>
<seg id="43">"Once again could we the UBS do not rescue", says bank researcher violinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">At the first catastrophe, the second joined.</seg>
<seg id="45">Already few months on that capitulated the UBS in the tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of being able to do customers, that had defrauded if possible taxes by means of the bank.</seg>
<seg id="46">Moreover it agreed a payment of 780 million dollars to - as a repayment of unjustified profits out of these businesses including punishment impact.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">Therewith well known the UBS more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">Simultaneously it lost been was something, that for time immemorial its capital in the competition around rich customers: the Nimbus of the discretion.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal, the Swiss was bank secret no longer that.</seg>
<seg id="50">The resignation of chief executive and supervisory board president followed it.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the Exodus of customer moneys.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">So the bank had lost its credibility in both central company divisions within less months: in the Investmentbanking through the false speculations and in the fortune administration through the aid to the tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And straight as it again somewhat quieter became, thought just than one, would manage now the UBS it already again, follows there this unfortunate dealer story: A single dealer verzockt 1.7 billions of Euro before the bank notices, that somewhat sloping runs.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it becomes obvious: With the risk management in the Investmentbanking, it does not work out obviously still.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case Adoboli has one assess must, that itself the risk inspection too little changed has", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the bank institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">Also the head of finance of a large German bank is certain: "The problem of the UBS is that they has not" the risk inspection in the handle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">At the same time it had been yet exact the idea of the caution, with which the Swiss was begun bankers long time ago, to become hats of the large fortunes of the world: no all too large risks, for that security for the money - the world liked to collapse also on the far side of the Alps republic once.</seg>
<seg id="58">The vaults of the Swiss banks had become landed the symbol for imperturbable reliability how and SprÃ¼ngli for especially noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich fits yet to the clichÃ© of the solid Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.</seg>
<seg id="60">Already the situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters at the ZÃ¼richer railway station street, that leads of the central station out of directly to Lake Zurich, that will frame of the snow-covered summits of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings here are splendid, the store rents belong to the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">One finds jeweler such as Tiffany's it here between Swiss tradition businesses such as the Confiserie SprÃ¼ngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries the Swiss has resided here banks: of the national bank over the palace of the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks such as Julius bear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">One enters the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are marble disguised, stand before that thick leather armchairs, next to the bank Logo a large reference sign to the "safe".</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows, what the customer seeks here: Security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">Both Swiss displaced this idea of the Swiss bank large banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however sometime - or betray how the boss of a small Swiss finds private bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">It would not like to read its name rather in the newspaper, makes in the end it, like all Swiss bankers, also with both large banks of businesses.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS had become much too large, finds it - above all in the Investmentbanking where moreover the hinge Saxons would have spread out.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss would have there nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if yet, they adapted" itself a long time to the customs of the hinge Saxons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Actually it was gave the Anglo-Saxon Investmentbanking that changed the UBS, its profits first high and then the debacle: No European financial institution lost so much money in the Subprime jungle like the Swiss large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">On the 15th of October 2008, the catastrophe became visible.</seg>
<seg id="75">"At that Wednesday concluded the government coalition of the small seven million country the largest rescue operation in the story of its nation", writes the author Lukas HÃ¤ssig in its book of "the UBS Crash".</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billions of Euro of allowed the politicians in order to rescue the large bank standing before the bankruptcy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How was it able to come in addition?</seg>
<seg id="78">If one speaks with Swiss banks, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998 merged themselves two of the three Swiss large banks to a powerful group.</seg>
<seg id="80">A bank emerged was, that already in the fusion to largely for the small Switzerland - and always further grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">At the same time helped that both different precursors banks of the UBS supplemented itself: one pass, but sleepy bank with the focal point fortune administration in Zurich and a poorer, but already more strongly internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly the internationalized investment banks came favorably at much money, with which they were able to turn a gigantic wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are connected with this ascent of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 group bosses of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairperson of the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I thought always, Wuffli and Ospel would be a dream team", says bank researcher Hans violinist.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, the Hochintellektuelle, modest, that much of models and statistics understands worked up here has" itself, and Ospel, the belly person, that of the bank scholar until very above.</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel had depended to the end on Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli had made a decisive mistake at the end probably: "It thought, its models would be the reality", says violinist.</seg>
<seg id="88">"That is a tragic case".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragically, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">Is clear: Insolence came before the case.</seg>
<seg id="91">Colleagues of the UBS remember clearly the management Meetings, on which group boss Wuffli issued again and again the same slogan: Knock Goldman special it of the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="93">It cited the "League Tables", that results tables, that documented the success of the banks of that time.</seg>
<seg id="94">There the UBS wanted, after very above.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps already had succeeded its.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the foreign currency business and in the share trade, it played very above.</seg>
<seg id="97">Management consultants who were delegated emphasized however a weakness: In the international interest business, in the bank language "Fixed Income", would give it a powerful distance to the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS has spaces in American mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">In order to close this space, UBS proceeded into an adventure, that cost it almost the existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungrily after growth, invested both the bank itself and a before its established Hedgefonds into American Subprime plants.</seg>
<seg id="101">It developed to a powerful machine, the securities on American mortgage credit packed and passed along - at the same time however also even risks retained.</seg>
<seg id="102">When other banks sought a long time the exit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"Yet in the summer 2007, when the American real-estate market in flames stood, has the UBS there bought", says bank expert violinist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager after the other had to go when the attempts fell out to clean up more hard than thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Posts in the UBS became the sling seat and are shaky until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">He who leads the large bank now, has a nearly impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">It must find a strategy for a bank, that all nearby business models are missing come.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Bank researcher violinist has already an idea: End with the Investmentbanking, concentration on the fortune administration, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">Very so far the bank does not want to go to be sure (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But the Investmentbanking strongly should shrink, so much is now already clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">At the coming Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce its future strategy.</seg>
<seg id="113">Italo Swiss old the 51 years was thought actually only as a temporary solution when the bank separated itself surprisingly by predecessor GrÃ¼bel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile he prevailed: It should lead durably the businesses of the UBS, divided the ZÃ¼richer bank on Tuesday with.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants to cut back the investment bank on the state middle of the nineties.</seg>
<seg id="116">It paints 3500 places.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">That not however will pass.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">With what does it want to earn money?</seg>
<seg id="121">Those are certain now already asks themselves the questions, that Axel weaver.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly he says would seek himself until now only, he with his wife first once a dwelling in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">In many places sowing crows count as a "problem birds" : Yet out of the cities, the highly intelligent animals can be banished by far more, maintain experts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The one like would like to get rid of it, that others it very quickly: Crows have belonged for centuries to the cityscape, but in many communities, resident troubles heap themselves over dirt and noise of the animals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">At the same time a means against the "problem is birds" not yet in visibility.</seg>
<seg id="5">Sowing crows would be to gotten out of the cities no longer, said experts in the first crow symposium in the east Frisian Leer.</seg>
<seg id="6">There specialists prepared out of the entire federal territory over possible exits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">They seek alternative in the cities</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Conservationists attributed at the same time the problems in cities also to the country flight of the especially protected sowing crows: The chemistry use in the agriculture destroys increasingly the traditional habitats.</seg>
<seg id="9">The hunt, increasing development and that cases of typical brood trees made the birds life heavily.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Crows stand under environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are sowed large colonies with more than 600 brood couples among other things in the westphalian, in the northwest among other things in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen as well as in Leer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">There a disputed project to the abundant killing of crows in the district had provided 2005 for negative headline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Critics had the catching of the animals in Vogelfallen and the killing with club as especially brutal designated.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="17">Let VergrÃ¤mung be only as an exception at hospitals, age homes or schools conceivably.</seg>
<seg id="18">"We must live with them, we get it no longer away".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Without the surrounding countryside, the problem in the cities could not be solved, meant mayor Wolfgang waiter out of Leer.</seg>
<seg id="20">Let a combination be conceivable out of frightening away of the animals out of sensitive living areas and curl offer in order to establish it at other places again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">"Information chalkboards instead of chain saws" the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta OF Maria JÃ¼rgen advertised on the other hand for a completely other contact with the animals: We can bear" "a pimple in the face in the end best self-confident.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">JÃ¼rgen had established with the Ascheberger crow scholar path in Schleswig-Holstein, at which reference signs inform about life of the highly intelligent sowing crows.</seg>
<seg id="23">The project would be supposed in the meantime already of tourist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an own opinion had JÃ¼rgen: "There a lot of communication, that is have itself much to say".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Sowing crows use not only remedy in order to come at a delicacy, but rather place its tool as a remedy even even here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Behavior researchers of the university Cambridge tested recently at four sowing crows how far the intelligence of the birds passes.</seg>
<seg id="27">In an experiment, the birds learned quickly that they must bring a scaffolding with stones to the collapse in order to arrive so at a moth larva.</seg>
<seg id="28">Without much training of recognized it purposeful, which size and form must have a stone, in order let collapse the platform.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In a second attempt, the smart crows had to solve then a kniffligeres problem.</seg>
<seg id="30">In a vertically set up cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.</seg>
<seg id="31">With the beak, the birds were not able to reach its prey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">To be sure the researchers had left them wire pieces.</seg>
<seg id="33">From that all four animals formed a hook, with whose aid it then the bucket at the handle out of the tube of fished.</seg>
<seg id="34">This succeeded three of the four sowing crows even on attempt.</seg>

<seg id="1">Massenschlachtung on a personal plain</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Perceptively and generous Peter begins book new Englunds "beauty and frights. A story of the first world war, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of head people, that goes one too heart.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Here a tip, how one advance could: Cut out this side carefully and make it to your bookmark.</seg>
<seg id="4">They will become acquainted with these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these head people will function as your GPS when lighthouse in this few moments in which you are lost like Englunds men and women in the fog of the war and are robbed your illusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is moreover the new permanent secretary of the Swedish academy that determines the Nobel Prize for literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">It wrote an unusual book, that it does not describe incorrect as an "a work of the Anti story".</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains only few names large, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassador, racing reporters or discussions over tactic and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is fewer a book about that what happened, explains it, but rather sooner "a book about, how it was". It is about "feelings, imprinting, experiences and moods".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"Beauty and frights" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, of schoolgirl and botanists up to mountain climber, physicians, ambulance driver and office employee.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of these people become heros.</seg>
<seg id="12">Some become war prisoner, lose limb, will displace or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these life flickers on like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come thereto while other extinguish.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It corrected had been moreover the presentation, the first world war only the devastating position war at the west front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Beauty and frights" hikes with expert view over other war scenes: the Alps, the Balkan Peninsula, the east front, Mesopotamia, east Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the soldiers in this book, bee baskets fall celebrates, one Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an unsolvable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">This is almost from the beginning a moving book.</seg>
<seg id="19">The war inundates life of these people such as a natural disaster how a hurricane Katrina that smells after Kordit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine, you are hears a woman who is with its children at home, and canon fire in the distance. Do you remain or seize the flight?</seg>
<seg id="21">Who comes generally?</seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands, what is happened or is waged war why this generally.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Missing facts", assesses Englund, "became with suppositions, acceptances, hopes, anxieties, quick ideas, conspiracy theories, dream, nightmares and rumors revamped".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and frights" follows single people such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stump, a young German ship sailor.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your stories were taken main memories, letters and other already published material.</seg>
<seg id="26">Your life reports can be frightening or seizing, but they are extremely living in Englunds of the aggregation losing in details of small moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them are itself about deficiency and stopgaps.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the story of a German schoolgirl, it tells: "Replacement, everywhere replacement".</seg>
<seg id="29">"Coffee substitute, incorrect aluminum, incorrect eraser, paper associations, wood buttons".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">It tells more of the replacement meal in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">It describes "meat that made out of pressed rice and in Hammelfett baked became (and finally with an incorrect bone out of wood served became), tobacco, that was made out of dried roots and dried potato scarves, shoes, that with wood sole were".</seg>
<seg id="32">There was how it notes, "837 registered nourishment replacement means, that in the manufacture of sausage permits were, 511 registered coffee replacement means".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories are about honor and courage.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American recognizes its own pressure to the wildness and says over the war: "One feels that that is in spite of all that, what to sit planned was sooner for men than in the armchair, to do with the evening newspaper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand, and so, as would mean such a facade civilization and as would give it no barbarism behind the own strengthened and covered shirt breast".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Reversed recognizes a British soldier that he probably die and no one would take therefrom notice or would be concerned therefore.</seg>
<seg id="36">"If one of the thought, itself to sacrifice, distance takes, would like one think, that this before an audience happens", writes it.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead of its it is became" as terrible as "a convicted man, that in the secret hanged.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations are about the old Europe, that falls apart, and over new types of the terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict became increasingly an economic contest", writes Englund, "a war between the factories".</seg>
<seg id="40">It catches the arrival its, what it names "a new species in the Bestiarium of the yet young century" : Measure murderers turned and ideologically convinced "the words in the measure suit who slaughters while he sits" behind a desk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave gives on unforeseen type and manner and it just as frivolous behavior such as heroism.</seg>
<seg id="42">Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect itself at a prostitute with a venereal disease, in order to escape the front service.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The grotesque expression its can in the trade with Gonokokken pus discovers become, for soldiers bought and itself on its genital greased, in the hope, so into the hospital to come", writes he.</seg>
<seg id="44">"That that really were doubted rubbed it into the eyes, what led in addition, that they were" blind the remainder of its life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation out of the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englunds poetry becomes pliant and yet unobtrusive and fits itself perfectly at its human task on.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes, it catches unleashed the type and manner, like the war "in unique manner uncontrollable powers: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".</seg>
<seg id="47">The people begin to ask themselves why its leaders bring it for fighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books over the first world war were was usually sooner falsified like Paul Fussells "Great and modern memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "in the west nothing new" as extensive history books.</seg>
<seg id="49">Englunds volume joins an unorthodox renown hall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Its book has devastating that end of which I read ever in a non-fiction book.</seg>
<seg id="51">I yield it no longer.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Hundreds of police officer were involved on that, some of them carried use helmets.</seg>
<seg id="3">One had decided on Monday night because to this time hardly people in the Zucotti park are.</seg>
<seg id="4">The operation secretly was held and were informed only few officials high-ranking. Everyone others believed originally to participate in a practice.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Chief of police Raymond W. Kelly was middle under them and its presence unterstrich the fact that the operation of full challenges stuck.</seg>
<seg id="6">The occurrences of the past weeks such as the use of pepper spray against protester, what violates the rules of the Dezernats and provided the squatters an enormous increase at public sympathies, were allowed to repeat itself no longer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">And so the police action became removing the protester out of the Zuccotti park after two weeks of the planning and training carried out.</seg>

<seg id="18">Mr. Kelly said that in the course of the day many people in the park go in and go out, almost like commuter so that 1 clock per night is a good moment in order to go in.</seg>
<seg id="19">"It was appropriate, this to do, if itself the slightest number of people in the park delays", said it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Rescue vehicles with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were available before the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive in the vicinity of the Manhattan Bridge.</seg>
<seg id="21">The lamps and the beforehand recorded messages that roared out of the loudspeakers, seemed many protesters to intimidate.</seg>
<seg id="22">When the public officials in its bright blue windjackets penetrated into the park, many protesters collected simply its things and left the place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The police said that until 1:45 clock no tents would be grasped in order to give the protester time, to pack its Hab and goods together.</seg>

<seg id="26">Paul J. Browne, speaker of the chief of police, said would be happen, this to its own securities.</seg>
<seg id="27">But many journalists maintain that one wanted to hold off it therefrom to observe the police actions in the park. And they said, the contact of the official had been very rough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mr. Browne said that TV vehicles in the Church streets would have been able to make photos at the west side of the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">As itself the police toward west through the large disorder at personal things of the protester, among other things suitcase, art lawn and paper bags with dresses, moved, followed its employee of the city cleaning, that canceled, what had been put back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Some protesters, that refused to go, were dragged after outside. Pictures hereof appeared already short time later on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="31">A head kernel of protester related position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the warehouse in the center of the park.</seg>
<seg id="32">Some erected barriers and the police continued its methodical arrests.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Approximately 10 people in the epicenter of the warehouse tied themselves to its arms together.</seg>
<seg id="34">And two people chained themselves at trees, said Mr. Kelly.</seg>
<seg id="35">Officials of the catastrophe protection were called, around it loose tailored.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">How Mr. Kelly said, became until ca. 3:30 clock no arrests in the park carried out.</seg>
<seg id="37">The clearance was locked after statements of the police after 75 minutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.</seg>
<seg id="39">To most arrests, it came how it said, based on "improper conduct and resistance against an arrest".</seg>
<seg id="40">The official most prominent on the spot was Joseph J. Esposito, the boss of the department, the official highest uniformed of the department.</seg>
<seg id="41">Phil T. Pulaski, department boss of the criminalists, was also there.</seg>
<seg id="42">In spite of its presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead" "the operation" how Mr. Browne said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">For the case that they take action, waited a second group of official at the eastern side of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar street.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">In the Cortlandt streets, a street block north of the park, and in the Pine streets, a block further south, were erected barricade.</seg>
<seg id="45">It could be observed how by these locations out of the police the vicinity always further around the Zuccotti park around expanded.</seg>
<seg id="46">At a place was observed how several officials, many of them with protection sign, people drove after outside.</seg>
<seg id="47">Approximately 28 people were in the northern vicinity.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<p>
<seg id="2">It looks in the end so, as would be republican and democrats in Washington already to notify itself with respect to the uprisings in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="3">All what was necessary to this, was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of the American interference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Thursday the committee will conclude for international relations of the senate a resolution, which is subordinate the chairperson together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph 1ST Lieberman (Connecticut) to John Kerry (Massachussetts), whereby one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US American troops for its "courage".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution honors the courageous people Libyens, that with the reconstruction of its country begun have", said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"You is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts through two parties".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language innocently likes to sound, but previously was nothing simple in the Libya debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Legislator of both parties and the white house fought this summer over the word choice of a row of resolution to the approval or disapproval of the roll of the US military in the Libya mission NATO.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June Kerry and McCain produced a resolution, which approved the restricted utilization of military powers of the USA in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The law was rejected in the senate through a wide edge group of both parties and came it to no voting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Yet at the same day, this law in the senate fell through. Moreover the chamber overruled a decision to the abridgment of the moneys for American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">Through it the US mission ran into a type legislative sweep ivy - with a congress, that to be sure raised was not enough to criticize Obamas procedure in the frame of the mission, but furiously enough in order to remove it finally the ground under the feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then the irresolution of the congress was overtaken of the events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripolis fell was killed in August under the Libyan rebel and Gaddafi on the 20th of October.</seg>
<seg id="15">NATO mission ended officially on the 31st of October.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the senate is perhaps ready for actions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the committee for international relations "congratulates the person Libyens to its enormous courage and its extraordinary endurance in its even release" and "praises the men and women of the US American military and its coalition partners, who support the military operations to the protection of the people in Libya, for its extraordinary courage and its professionalism".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution strengthens moreover "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable transition Libyens to the democracy".</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">In this week, an important hearing decides about whether 28 women and men are not accused because of intervention in a rape before the court martial.</seg>
<seg id="3">If it should not come in addition, hundreds of complainants stand for the next hearing ready.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when it was raped at night by a soldier colleague.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was returned 2008 and it just to its barracks in Miramar north in October of San Diego of the supper with a friend when it encountered on a masculine colleague, who carried a 12 pack beer with itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">It asked it whether it would be allowed to accompany it on a Drink into its room.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My alarm bells went at", said Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texan wiped its objections aside.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: "Alas what, it is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is from Texas", said it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wished, I would have heard" on my belly feeling.</seg>
<seg id="12">Few minutes after they had gone on Lymans room, the man stepped behind it, pressed it downward and raped it, maintains it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on the 18th of November, Lyman and 27 wait other present and earlier military employees anxiously for a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which decided becomes, whether a complaint, that they raised against the earlier Minister of Defense Robert Gates and its predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, is allowed, before court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complaint maintains that Gates and Rumsfeld against the far common rape within the military and under injury the constitutional right of the soldiers did not advance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer out of Washington, D.C.S submitted, comprised the complaint originally 17 complainants, who increased however in the following months on 28: 25 Women and three men who maintain everyone, that they were raped or sexually abused by soldier colleague, and that the military neglected it to make available to determine, to convict or an appropriate jurisdiction after the supposed attacks.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says, it would pursue the uppermost military leadership because the problem would begin there.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is hierarchical constructed", says it.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the single people who are in the position to eradicate the culture reward of that to? The leadership".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke says moreover that it contacted for February almost 400 further surviving, many of them could be part of future complaints.</seg>
<seg id="20">Your strategy: Instead of that all complainants put so to speak its eggs into a basket, become it if necessarily, many further complaints submit, around the pressure uprightly to receive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of the defense for the defense ministry, cited of federal district attorney Neil MacBride, placed a proposal in order to reject complaint.</seg>
<seg id="22">The acts of the court that exist Newsweek itemize in detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be accused by present or earlier soldier for injuries, to which it came in the military forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">Based on a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, THE so-called Feres doctrine, sticks the government not for injuries, that are added itself in the active service of present soldier.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The presumed damages emerged during the military service of the complainants", purports the document.</seg>
<seg id="25">The defense ministry denies every commentary to this story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The things changed since the '1950's.</seg>
<seg id="27">If women are not allowed yet always to the service in the battle, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams play attach roles increasingly important by soldiers, especially in the contact with domestic women in the war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: between these two getting 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them in battle actions died.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And it does not stand there in its battle alone: three further complaints except hers are pending.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the Yale Law School prepares the veterans' legal services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of presumed support of a misogynistic atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">Hereof independently veteran gathers the public-spirited Vietnam of America a complaint against the military before, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis "personality interference", that rape victims received to release around it out of the service - an usual procedure according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's it Action network, a human right group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Your group passed in December complaint against the veteran administration (dt. : Administration of the war veteran) on, in that it its practices discriminating in its contact with achievement claims for people reproached, who indicated to have become sexually abused in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws was produced independently from one another through a mixture out of senators and representatives of both parties the congress, that offer a row of criteria.</seg>
<seg id="36">2010 became according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (dt. : Office for prevention and message of sexual abuse) the defense ministry 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.</seg>
<seg id="37">Yet most abuses are not reported at all and after the own estimation of the Pentagon, this number considers ca. 13.5 percent of the appreciated 19,000 cases to which it comes per year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report that was published in March examines also the punishment pursuit rates: 2010 came 20 percent of the grasped cases in the military before court, only half so many like in the civil law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The complainants in Burkes case describe its attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Lymans case, it reported the presumed rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this night, says it, became it 11 times asked to tell the details of its rape of a whole series of policemen, physicians and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">It had was found a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of its aggressor, that came from a cut at its arm, in its bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, was listened to Lyman of a judge. During this hearing, it was asked about the sex, that it had spread before that with its friend.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people stated as character witnesses in the name of the presumed culprit, who was absolved in the end.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I remind one me yet well of the day, when the judgment misread became", says Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought would use, the pains. I raced screaming out of the courtoom".</seg>
<seg id="47">"You brought remember into the psychiatric department and I me that I came out, when I again, to my commander said me: That was not its procedure. That was my procedure".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was requested to search for a military psychiatrist, who diagnosed in the end a personality interference and it for unfit for duty declared.</seg>
<seg id="49">It became release in January 2010 dishonorable so that it receives no support at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the complaint, that Lyman and the other complainants submitted, makes headway,, is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence at the George Washington University Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless, so it notices in: "In my opinion, they should make headway".</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a sentence, is this doctrine, that is criticized, since it was questioned for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am for life a critic of the Feres doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military limps a decade afterwards, for they do not possess the same stimuli and the same deterrence that entails a liability.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="55">It adds: "The chances stand against it... however it is important to it, that it it try".</seg>
<seg id="56">These things will change only then if good people to fight are ready.</seg>

<seg id="1">If wound have eyes: How researchers observe you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before it became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Behring Breivik was differently only an of many boys, who sent its Anti immigration opinion Online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday Breivik that stood had to have committed in a crazed rampage in Norway in July, with which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before court.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik alone may have acted, it is by far not alone in the cyberspace: It spent much time to its attack before its computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalist, that radical right-wing groups support on sides of social network.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this in the summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet how does one find it?</seg>
<seg id="7">That is easily - one must log on only with Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We assessed, that it was not heavy, to them to come", says Jamie Bartlett, the head author of a most young appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOES over the digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Data personal Facebook ambush is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett that the researchers must use simply the advertise tool of the side to determine around its desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so like it marketer for years have done.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team found a half million fans of radical right-wing groups throughout Europe and adjusted it then with Adds on, but instead of linking itself with a new volume or a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a survey, in which after its development state, its bearing vis-Ã -vis force and the estimation of its own future asked became.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and its colleagues in a position, more were to be questioned than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without that they must would have left also only once its office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a quite new research method", says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results surprise hardly. Online promoters of radical right-wing groups are usually young, man-like and be angry about the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But in a type of surprising twisting, "that, that more sensibly combine its Online activism with an Offline activism, are, more democratic and less violent as that, that remain" sit behind its computer screens.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Only an example is DEMOES work how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Idea factories, medical researchers and politics scientist use the side in order to study all, of health questions up to company trend such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">Users active with more than 800 millions, who add in the average three of contents per day, "data generates Facebook supernova" a Forschungsboom that the amount of the scientific works with the name of this side in the title in the last five years let climb around almost 800%.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers, the beautiful of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this side people, whom one does not reach normally with its Clipboard on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If you earlier tried to question people of the British national party, to identify" was it very heavy, it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"You must first the party inform and that would have them never access grants", says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"With Facebook, that of all falls away - you go directly to them".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the side offers a possibility to recognize and to solve social health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and its colleagues found out that students, who discussed its full intoxication on Facebook, tend, significantly more strongly to the Problemtrinken than students, who were quiet over this subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example accustomed adviser, who supervise side and help a student, posts if this too many status updates.</seg>
<seg id="25">"You can a problem do not solve, if you it not recognized have", said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development by the Children's it Research institutes in Seattle of the washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We did not find differently found become were" a possibility to identify endangerd children, that.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook taps moreover permanently the data of its own population.</seg>
<seg id="28">The data team of the side has statistics over the relation status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout at the between choices 2010 and one nationally good fortune index generated (where primarily statements uses became, on that only Facebook access has - master of the digital freedom know for some time, that the side its large data treasure trove for other research purposes accessibly make should).</seg>
<seg id="29">Yet the users of Facebook do not know that the side observes it, whether they want that now or. Around with a friend, who is removed thousands of miles to be able to play Scrabble, permitted one the side the own personal data pass from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what do if the users of Facebook part of a survey become, of which they not know yet once something?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have guidelines exertally determined, how they gather its data Offline, is permitted Online everything.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I believe not, that many users generally over the fact thought have, that a researcher its profiles study could", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in the London Knowledge lived, to a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public sides of students on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="33">"What concerns it, concerned it only it and its friends".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is yet the question of the methodics.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even Offline there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">On Facebook, it is to be known impossible how many of the statements in a user profile and in contributions are true.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What one on Facebook says and what one outside of of Facebook makes, are two totally different things", says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore Selwyn thinks in spite of its years as a technology researcher that a Clipboard and a pencil are yet always the best research tools, that everyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"It gives no replacement for that, into the real world to go out and with real person to speak", says he.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research must attend to the social - and a lot of social life finds yet always Offline instead of".</seg>

<seg id="1">7 Lessons of the interview with the deceased Steve jobs that this week in a theater was shown</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After death of Steve jobs on the 5th of October some compared it to Henry Ford and lifted at the same time the technology genius as a large modern inventor forth.</seg>
<seg id="3">What Apple fans find however perhaps informativest in the most young again discovered job interview, which became in this week before special film demonstrations on the important markets entstaubt, is how very this creative head understood business processes and work flows.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hip pi, but he was did handicrafts also a meticulous organizer, that enthusiastically at charts - a man who believed, that many managers suffer from "an illness of the thinking", "that a really magnificent idea 90 percent of the work settles... [however] There is an enormous quantity at craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">1995 developed quaked Cringely the series of TV "triumph the specialists with no other interests" over the departure the personnel computer. And it sat more long than an hour with jobs together, in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this time had passed as a 10 years since jobs had been pressed out of Apple. And he worked looked already hard at its new computer business NeXT, and forward to the wide acceptance of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialists with no other interests, he says that the copy model of the interview were absent from the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="8">First after jobs death one discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This easily revised film material forms the base for the 68minÃ¼tigen film "Steve jobs: The lost interview", that this Wednesday and Thursday comes into the country marks theaters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone, who is for that well known that it detests detailed interview, appears jobs here surprisingly enthusiastically in the explanation of its technological philosophies and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly reflectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the course of the interview, it comes four times to longer recesses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds pondering in which jobs weighs unambiguously its thoughts and is striven around accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There is also moments, in which jobs comes' Perfektionismus too days, if it reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and to go in it anschubst, more quickly on subjects or subplots of larger importance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone received appears the lost interview somehow uncannily farsighted if job values, what other businesses its opinion make correctly or incorrectly and its own vision to the future the computer represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is a thing to read posthumous assessments of the career jobs'. To see but jobs here as the desirous dreamer, who is on the leap to the grandeur, is somewhat very differently, originally and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">It has a vision how the things could be and be should.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after it had carried out this here everything, it pulled loose and made it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A fast view of seven remarkable sequence of the lost interviews:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">How it learned to lead a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">"During the entire years in the business I ask always: "Why do you do things"?. And the answer that you always get is: "Oh, so it simply is made".</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why it does, what it does. No one in the business thinks really detailed about things.</seg>
<seg id="22">I assessed that.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs continues its efforts from to streamline the accounting in Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Astonish, recorded became developed like costs - usually began one with "standard costs", that on bare supposition there numbers became and that then with "deviation" adapted became - it an automated factory that guaranteed, that the business costs could be determined into the smallest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">How the pope ridiculed became:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs tells of that "Blue box", that it constructed with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one was able to sneak in into the telephone company and long distance calls was able to lead for nothing.</seg>
<seg id="27">Over the device, much was written already, but jobs enthusiasm when it describes the Blue box as an act of the SelbstbemÃ¤chtigung, is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">It describes how Wozniak and it would test the box, in that they use a chargeable telephone, a call of active and then of an AT&T-network in another combine while they possible grind through so many satellites such as.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We sent things a half dozen once around the globe and if one into the telephone grÃ¶lte, came it a minute later in the telephone next door again out", tells jobs giggling.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we learned that we ourselves can construct something, the trillion of dollar at infrastructure in the entire world control can".</seg>
<seg id="31">We both, we much did not know, but we were able to construct this small thing, was believe that can control a gigantic thing, that an incredible lesson and I not that it would give without it Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs passes on of a glorious stroke, that Wozniak and it nearly had drawn-off, when they called middle in the night via Blue box in the Vatican and wanted to speak with the pope, during it so well it Henry Kissinger could imitated.</seg>
<seg id="33">Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned middle in the night, in order to speak with the American diplomat, must loose laugh both before the pope himself came at the telephone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">How it into the technology fell in love (and unprepared Bill Hewlett called) :</seg>
<seg id="35">At the age of 12 years, when it searched for spare parts, in order to construct a frequency meter, it searched Hewlett in the directory for Bill and called it on.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after its 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer a part-time job in Hewlett pack Ard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the single business, that I had seen in the age, and it formed my views about that, what a business was and like good it its colleagues treated".</seg>
<seg id="38">Later became jobs of one of the HP colleague, that visited the research laboratories of the business in Palo Alto, where he saw produced became" "the first desktop computer, that ever.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was as large as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown scissors tube and I enamored me into it.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would climb in HP as a teenager towards the top and would hang on this machine and write programs for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How one innovations improves:</seg>
<seg id="42">Repeatedly in the interview speaks jobs about how one invents spontaneously new products.</seg>
<seg id="43">Already early in its career when it incorporated some platinums, was asked it of a customer to assemble the entire computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">It worked with a period allowed for payment of only 30 days and must both think out the assembly and the extradition of the finished devices.</seg>
<seg id="45">Later in Apple, he remembers the problems, that he had in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remind one me of decisive arguments... You schrien on that it would last five years [around a mouse to construct, that $ 300 cost would become] and I stood me, went out and found a manufacturer".</seg>
<seg id="47">We later had ninety days a mouse that we were able to construct let for $ 15. That was incredibly trustworthy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Over large businesses, that diminish:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before it let Apple revival, predicted jobs the ways, on which so many industry giants with its visions in stumbling ridden and the control lost of its shares,.</seg>
<seg id="50">Say we "work, you in IBM or Xerox, therefore you make a better copier or printer, well and"?</seg>
<seg id="51">They possess the share monopoly, therefore the business is no longer successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">VerkÃ¤ufe and marketing make lead it more successfully, therefore [are it such people], that in the end the businesses and the product with which the people are pressed out of the decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The product genius, who led to this monopoly position, will have no draft of the people, that regarding good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craftsmanship necessarily.</seg>
<seg id="54">That happened in Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have been able to possess the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">One more largely would have been able to be ten times, would have can the Microsoft of the '1990's its...</seg>
<seg id="57">They caught the defeat of the victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Over innovation as an art form:</seg>
<seg id="59">"It lies a lot of craftsmanship between a magnificent idea and a magnificent product... if one this magnificent idea develops, changes it and are awake".</seg>
<seg id="60">One learns much over its subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">One must undertake votings, determined things, that one cannot, but electrons, glass, robot, factories.</seg>
<seg id="62">One must notice himself 5000 things, join these drafts, and it everyone...</seg>
<seg id="63">In the end it runs out runs on the taste, it on that out that one tries, with the best thing, that people created, apart sits down and tries then to join these things to that, what one makes.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, magnificent artists swipe.</seg>
<seg id="65">We are always shameless in the stealing of magnificent ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Part its, what magnificently made Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologists, historian were, who are accidental the best computer scientists of the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">If it had not been the computer industry, they would create in other areas fantastic things.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health laws when court case supposes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">At the day, at which the Supreme Court meets behind locked doors, in order to discuss the politically dividing question whether one will listen to an attack of the health laws of president Obama, took two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a Dinner part, that became of the office gesponsort, that the case before court represented becomes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The occurrence took place past Thursday when all nine judges to a discussion met in order to advise over the petition to the test.</seg>
<seg id="4">A complaint, that 26 countries against the long-range reform of public health raised, was one of that to treated cases, that were concluded past year by the congress, a law that became at the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the slogan.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed the hearing. Actually a 5 1/2-stÃ¼ndige base discussion is expected in March, will boost that probably its result probably the presidency battle 2012, that will be at the time, at which the court decision is announced, in the full gear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer, who will stand and maintain before court, that the law is to be tipped over, will be probable Paul Clement, once general district attorney under the government of George W. Bush.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two dozen businesses, that supported the annual Dinner of the federalist company, an old-established group that dedicates itself the defense of conservative right principles.</seg>
<seg id="8">One of the business associations represents another business, that the Dinner sponsorte, Jones Day,, that nationally Federation of Independent business, that contest the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">A further sponsor was the pharmacy giants Pfizer inc. that enormously is involved financially in the result of the process.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Dinner took place few hours after the court had advised over the case, in one Washington hotel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Service had among other things Mitch McConnell, the floor leader of the republicans in the senate and a declared opponent of the health reform</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">That is nothing new: Both judge have visited for years organizations of the federalist company.</seg>
<seg id="14">And that does not violate moral rules.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the deed judge of the code of behavior frees itself, who regulates the actions of the low federal judges.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">If they were it, they would fall probably under principle 4c of the code, that following purports: "A judge can at Benefizveranstaltungen law more closely and other organizations participate whereby the judges may" be no speaker, guest of honor or according to program no guest of such an organization.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless sufficed the extreme vicinity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the offices standing with the case in context as well as to a business with a massive financial interest in this in order to alarm moral-and-government activists.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">"This stunning breach with moral and the contrast to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court would comply with the same rules, that for all other federal judge count", said quaked Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil right movement in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with floating procedures at the court".</seg>
<seg id="20">Your appearance and its support of a fund-raising campaign for this organization undermine each claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Scalia and Thomas show little consideration on critic, who say, they would become court matter too easy with groups, that can be led of the order of the day, how for example the federalist company, mix.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the Thomas' wife Ginni a well known conservative activist is.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">On the other hand the conservatives do not maintain that it would be judge Elena Kagan, that would have a moral problem, Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kagan was general district attorney under the Obama government when the first law attacks in first instance came before court.</seg>
<seg id="25">Your critics pressed Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the trap because of prejudice because it would be engaged too very in the defense of the law in order to be unbiased.</seg>
<seg id="26">Kagan makes no institutes to do this.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">"During the wartime units in the anti-terrorist battle through the seizure not directly concerned are, would become the serious intervention into the reason budget the war efforts disadvantageously influence", warned Panetta.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Personnel attitudes were shortened become, what would become" lead delays in the attitudes and the attitude supervision, that support the war.</seg>
<seg id="12">"The salaries of the personnel would be shortened, what leads to late payments at wartime dealer and disturbed" would be the legal like also political support.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Panetta answered both senators 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic abridgments on the defense ministry.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of a seizure of the defense ministry would initiate" a fast decline of the United States as a leading military power of the world.</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are vehement against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint explanation on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is is a result with which we cannot live, and it certainly no that one should" impose us.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The seizure is not should become" a threat of the national security interests the united place and its entering allowed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">To exempt whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or demands will reinforce, the Pentagon from abridgments, remains to await.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta expressed increasingly blunt the possible abridgments although it was able to gather many years experiences with the budget in the congress and in the white house, before it came at the tip of the Pentagon, and knows that it stands vis-Ã -vis heavy decisions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">On a press conference in the past week, the Minister of Defense painted be forthcoming could a gloomy picture, what - a military with shell, but without kernel.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailor".</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without ammunition".</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is a Luftwaffengeschwader without sufficiently educated pilots".</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, building and bombs without sufficiently educated soldiers, that in a position are, the mission to fulfill", said Panetta in its opening talk in the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a dispute power, that it lacks at moral and alarm readiness and that is not in a position, to receive" it with potential opponents.</seg>
<seg id="26">"You lets become" one actually furiously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In a supplement to its letters at McCain and Graham, Panetta cited creates new details, like reductions "significant strategic risks: Delays in periods of crisis, conflicts and catastrophes, serious restrictions of our worldwide use capacity and intervention capacity, what to an unacceptable risk in future war operations leads".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the largest defense projects of the deletion could fall victim, inclusive those who already were tested and be already in the early planning phase.</seg>
<seg id="29">To this list, also the battle flyer belongs F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomb airplane, the next generation of ballistic U boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground battle vehicle that Army and navy need in order to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">If one would stop the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years to 80 trillion dollar, but the advocates say that it is an important next step to the rearmament, so that possible dangers by China and other opponents banned will can.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">A view of the current headlines shows, like doubtful and far spreads are deceit and lie in the daily life.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The presidency candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is busied therewith to become the accusations of sexual annoyance on the part of several women gentleman. Both sides accuse themselves mutually the lie.</seg>
<seg id="4">The direction of Penn State is accused the perjury because one held back nominally reports, after which a retired Footballtrainer boy sexually abused.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In the past week was listened to with over an open microphone when the French president of the state Nikolas Sarkozy maintained vis-Ã -vis the American PrÃ¤sidenten Barack Obama, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu would be a liar.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Lies destroy careers and shake countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">That congresswoman New York and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made itself to the fool when it brought denials in circulation, that were refuted very quickly by irrefutable proofs.</seg>
<seg id="8">The earlier presidency candidate John Edwards is accused the offences in the campaign financing, that stands in the context with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.</seg>
<seg id="9">And then no one whom it experienced forgets naturally, the medium circus that President Bill Clinton released, when he put during its second tenure in the oval Office regarding its sexual relation to Monica Lewinsky.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Stories over cheating in the school and in College tests far are spread.</seg>
<seg id="11">There were occurrences, with which teachers purported its student the test answers, so that it itself stood there in its achievement examinations well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">How much do deceit we experience?</seg>
<seg id="14">How studies cover, let's lie every day between 10 and 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many of these lies count however as a need lies.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study shows that strange lie to itself mutually three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To recognize lying and/or to uncover" "lies is one, that importantly is to be learned for every person, and this both out of personal like also for professional reasons.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Far of a company game such as for example Scharaden removes, in which it is the goal, "Hab you"! to call, is the uncovering of a deceit a serious white area that is based on scientific data, that were gathered in the course of the past six decades at esteemed universities, that carried out long-range research projects, especially in the areas psychology and physiology.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A result of the research is that most old myths became uncovers over the lying.</seg>
<seg id="20">Lie view one into the eyes.</seg>
<seg id="21">They stutter, stammer, blush and fidget not always.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Hence one not however may close that these liars are to be uncovered and are to be uncovered heavily.</seg>
<seg id="23">A practiced LÃ¼genenttarner can permeate to the truth in that it learns something over the structure of the statement the fine expressions, over question and timing.</seg>
<seg id="24">I spent several years therewith to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the uncovering. And it is clearly that the uncovering of a deceit is a modern capacity, that is to be learned easily and helps us in the getting along in our complex world, especially if the adjusting or the questioning of people or negotiations or administration to the own professional responsibilities belong.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Good liars are very well therein, to estimate other people, whose interest to wake and to control the own emotions. And they sense intuitive how they are perceived by others.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Thanks to the research, we, who lie extroverted people more frequent than introverted people, know, that men serve more frequently "even oriented" lies as women, whose lies more "at others orient" themselves - as a rule want to protect it therewith the feelings of others -that married people frequently would adjoin its partners fewer than unmarried people (however the lies, that it tell, are most "fat lies").</seg>
<seg id="27">We know also that, if a person became uncovers as a culprit, other fewer indebted feel to have designed this person.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">How does one recognize whether someone lies?</seg>
<seg id="29">First, in that you observe the normal behavior of this person.</seg>
<seg id="30">One names that "Baselining", the exit position.</seg>
<seg id="31">It purports a general reference point for later valuing of variations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Observe the bearing, the laughing, the voice quality of its test subject.</seg>
<seg id="33">They better should know when someone do not accuse normally permanently with the foot trippelt, so that it it to wrong, if it during a Meetings with the foot trippelt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then you pay attention more noticeable verbaler and nonverbaler manners to accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="35">Do not regard this accumulation as an alarm bells, the shrill, as a proof of an uncovering.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">People who deceive, harden perhaps if they try to remember its story. Perhaps its feet show lean themselves toward door or it toward exit, change its position in significant manner or show one "relaxation after the attitude conversation", this deep, relaxing breathing out and the change in the bearing if all hard questions are past.</seg>
<seg id="37">Asking signal often falsely that an attitude conversation is past, to hold only around after this relaxation after the attitude conversation lookout.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Eighth you moreover on the language of your test subject.</seg>
<seg id="39">The slip of Scott Peterson is famous when it used the past form, when it maintained, its killed wife would be live yet at that and search released a national for it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">Deceptive people can use also a dissociating language: "I no sexual relation with this woman had... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a knifflige question in the entire.</seg>
<seg id="41">The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.</seg>
<seg id="42">Many people use "qualifying language" if they answer a knifflige question: To say âNun.. around you the truth... so far well known is me... after best knowledge and conscience".</seg>
<seg id="43">Hereby the answer becomes sooner perceiving as objective by what means often the alarm bells of shrill.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">There is no magic means for uncovering of lies, but one can learn capacities, thanks to which an uncovering is possible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">Thanks to these capacities, every can become rarer the victim of frauds, both in that privately like in the professional life.</seg>

<seg id="1">The court approves the transition for 2015 on the digital television in Mexico</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The transposition of the analogous on digital signals belongs in the last years worldwide to the most important variations.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The colonel of court Mexico (SCJN) shwas will must the constitution complaints, that were submitted by the senate and the house of representatives against the presidential directive, and on the basis of that the switch from analogous to digital signals of 2021 on 2015 embarrassed, based on missing eight voices, that are required to the law attack, back.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">A minority of four ministers, under that also the president the colonel court, Juan Silva Meza, was would have the view, the PrÃ¤sident Felipe CalderÃ³n its responsibility not exceeded when he published the law decree with the details over the switch on the terrestrial digital television.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">With this decision, that constitution dispute was rejected established by the senate because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight voices, so that the court could not decide over the constitution temperance or the constitution temperance. So the law in power remains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In the project for the complaint, that was prepared by the minister Olga SÃ¡nchez Cordero, was proposed to declare the law decree to be unconstitutionally because for that the radio and television is responsible regulation relevant the ComisiÃ³n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale commission for telecommunication in Mexico), why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">For the benefit of the project, only ZaldÃ­var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and SÃ¡nchez Cordero itself agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">With this argument passed both the senate and the delegate chamber constitution troubles against the law decree on. After acceptance of the complaints, the minister SÃ¡nchez Cordero used the law decree no longer and adjusted all activities to the arrangement of the digital transmission.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cabinet council rejected also the complaint submitted by the delegate chamber to enter without at the same time into the debate over the project, for which also the minister SÃ¡nchez Cordero was responsible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">In its contribution, the Prime Minister expressed to not to be with the arguments of the project agreed, and to be sure in the sense that the country government may not regulate with general directions the measures that the public administration should seize.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">"I do not believe also that, if one would do that, the independence of the regulation place impaired would become". It remembered also that for the planning of strategic politics areas, like for example the sector of the telecommunication, for constitutional reasons the centrally national governments is responsible, for this leads the country matters.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The replacement of the analogous signals through digital is caused one of the most important variations, that took place in the last years in the entire world, and it a better utilization of the radio electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more canals.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The postponing of the transposition, meant it, would be a delaying of the NutznieÃung of the digitalization, what a decision in the public interest would be, that would have not only technical viewpoints, "for it would comprise economic, social, political and safety aspects".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">These matters, emphasized it, "made the actions of the entire system required, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction through the country of included it a group of features, that the constitution into the hands of the centrally national government would put".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It called into the memory that many countries already would have carried out worldwide the digital transposition, and to be sure over the government, although it over highly specialized arrangements of ordered.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">One could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree would interfere into the competences of the congress, for the laws dismissed by the legislature would be kept", assured it.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="8">So that cannot under the following conditions in one or several choice packages contained voices partially counted out become the results in the protocols agree unanimously; the protocol over the voice counting and -calculation does not exist act moderate not or it is in the possession of the chairperson of the choice committee or it gives obvious mistakes or alterations in the protocols.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="10">The voice counting can result also in its entirety if after conclusion of the orderly calculation assessed becomes, that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate is on the second place same or more slightly than an one percent, prefaced lies it a specific proposal of a representative of the party whose candidate second became, before. In this case, the choice packages that were stopped a partial counting would be excluded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Worth mentioning is that the choices are in Morelia in the same situation, where in accordance with PREP the difference between the first and the second place amounts to nearly 0.16 percent, although the voices were not counted out of 129 of altogether 923 choice protocols yet.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="4">A communication out of the presidency palace announced appointed meet would become, that that on Sunday Monti on Wednesday with the president of the state, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of a government.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is assumed that it will introduce a cabinet put together by a majority out of technocrats, although yet clear is not, when the new Prime Minister will begin its office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Monti said, it would introduce the president of the state the results of the conversations with the political parties to the formation of a government.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"I would like my absolute confidence into the capacity of our country, with these difficult times finished to become, strengthen", said the former EU commissioner the journalist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Monti did not confirm goes specifically the formation of a government, but out of its commentaries forth that the hindrances are overcome.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">That "frame now well is demarcated", joined it thereto.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Monti created it in less than three days to form a government, that is much less time than normal. In the meantime Italy against a political and financial crisis, that drove the costs for the guilt into an intolerable height, fights.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The new government led by the former EU commissioner Monti must dismiss a hard austerity package, that was demanded by the Euro politicians, in order to recover the marred confidence in Italy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The pressure to that hurries, grown stronger that weighs on Monti, yet through the fluctuating market condition, as a result of which the Italian government bonds were burdened for 10 years with 7 percent interests. That corresponds to the state, with which Greece and Ireland saw forced themselves, to apply for the European rescue screen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria announced the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said would support" we this government after all powers.</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance, so that Italy comes out out of this need situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The chances of success Montis considerably were enlarged through the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, that had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe, that the exertions of the professor Monti in addition determines are, good results to induce", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-to the right-party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is talked things out essential, for until now many of its members against a government existing by a majority out of technocrats, that just forms Monti.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support of the parliament</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti requires a strong parliamentary support to the conversion of the probably unpopular savings measures.</seg>
<seg id="20">Resistance against its exertions or the out hesitation of the reforms could cause again a devastating attack of the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian association of foreign banks exercises would be with its reference, a failure Montis a catastrophe, also pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Monti began on Monday with its debates with political parties, labor unions and entrepreneur associations as well as with youth organizations and woman organizations.</seg>
<seg id="23">Tuesday evening is supposed to be locked the session round.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">After short sigh of relief toward the end of that last week when well known became, that Berlusconi would resign, reached as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister the costs for the Italian government bonds again critical boundaries.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A rescue of Italy with a country guilt in height of 1.8 trillion Euro, would be too much for the present EU rescue screen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said, its government would must to the next choices, that are held off presumably in 2013, last, in spite of the predictions that the politicians will give it only time to the conversion of the reforms to prefer in place of the choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti expressed, it would include gladly politician in its cabinet, but the large parties exist on that that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to its objections in view of the of the pressure of the financial markets imposed procedure.</seg>

<seg id="23">We love this country, we surf gladly and are enthused of the jungle. For that Costa Rica to the best countries of the world belongs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How did you become acquainted with Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many of our friends are have surfer and I a magnificent friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends went always for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the areas outstanding for surfing. In this manner, over people, who love the surfing, we learned therefrom.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">With a view of the tour, its Riesenshows with many songs offered.</seg>
<seg id="28">Which plans do you have for the organization in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Because we never played there, we sit down also no boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the optimum show with many different songs. We want to play a couple of song out of every album and want to offer our fan a good and multilateral repertoire.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">You never repeat your repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe, that is in part so because we can have nine disks and can play over 120 songs. Everyone pleases another song so that the decision which we will play respectively does not fall, easily.</seg>
<seg id="34">If we played two or three songs, that we already more long no longer, include in the repertoire, better uprightly can receive we our concentration and surprise it us because they call us the reasons into the memory, why these songs pleased us. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes believe the show more interesting for us and I, therefore also for the audience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour celebrates it your twenty twenty year-old stories.</seg>
<seg id="37">Do if you look back, it falls to believe you heavily in your success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, totally.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all once I believe that no one imagined of us to play once in a magnificent rock band, and that also yet over for 20 years. That causes like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We set also further on this blessing and find it crazy, also to be able to make now yet together music.</seg>
<seg id="41">We like ourselves and are enthused therefrom, to produce music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have visit wanted good fortune to be able to go at the places of the world, that we already always once.</seg>
<seg id="43">The things not better could stand.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What did it mean for you, at whom birth hour of the Grunge actively to have participated?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It was always an honor to belong to this group large volume.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are good with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friendly.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprisingly and amply unusual if a movement follows out of a group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="48">There and again a volume follows out of a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come simultaneously out of the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proudly on that and feel honored to be part of the Seattle group.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we play together still.</seg>
<seg id="51">In the last year, we were saw on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we Soundgarden on its tour. We are happy to be still with them of all friendly and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle Sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very unusual that a volume such as that remained together your times so long with the same musicians.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us have played together already for 21 years and mat (Cameron) knocked 13 years ago to us. That much is alone already survive more time, than many volumes.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all once I believe that we happily appreciate ourselves everyone to be yet alive and moreover we attend to one another.</seg>
<seg id="55">We everyone am close friends why musical ways opened themselves, that give every single the freedom for experimenting.</seg>
<seg id="56">One trusts to the other and its music. It not better could go us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relations to the renown was not always simple. On the other side were able to make its thanks to your success always that, what you wanted.</seg>
<seg id="58">How do you find a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The type how we grew, more simply made us it to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We place to be certain, not too often on tour, for it is too easy to decayed this game with gigantic crowds of people that love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">As long as one think, that the people came because of the music, remembers you that, that you the music and that what called it into life eighth must, without verse eat on that to its a famous rock star to be. That never interested us anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">Which memories do you have at your other project Mother Love Bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I believe, we wrote very good songs and to beginning, it was magnificent.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were for three years a volume that never had published to death of Andy (Andrew Woods) a disk.</seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed about that, to have needed so long. We are constructed yet always good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), that with us the volumes, friendly. If I hear a song or see photos, keep in mind I, what kind of incredible person Andy was and brought like he me for laughing. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh jointly and to speak over music and soccer and many other subjects.</seg>
<seg id="66">It was miss an extraordinary person and we it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">Robertas read are the native volumes for the opening of the show in Costa Rica responsible.</seg>
<seg id="68">Does it agree that it its works knows, especially Eddie Vedder, and chose the volumes therefore for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production sent pleased us videos of several groups and these volumes us best. Therefore we are to be seen curiously, read live offer can what Robertas. That becomes certainly exciting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter always if its live plays?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.</seg>
<seg id="72">It sings it, and I believe, it sings the first what occurs to it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Of whom were you influenced as a bass?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Of so many +</seg>
<seg id="75">To the first, that occur to me, Geezer butler, John Entwistle, belong C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">So many are that I could speak the entire afternoon over the basses, who please me.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How did it create Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge alive although it concerns no longer a fashion appearance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I believe, feel connected us we everyone not very with the word Grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I think about that, occur me the volumes, that I mentioned previously, for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all other that arose to the same time. If they are yet important also today, I find that magnificently, for it is worthwhile to hear this music and make volume such as Mudhoney now better music than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Originally its music was is darker, now it more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">That is interesting, for I there believe is, a couple of song on the new album, that somewhat frivolously could cause. But there are also other songs such as The End or just Breathe, that are classified as a very dark songs, although they have also something positive at itself.</seg>
<seg id="83">To both came heard played me the tears, when I like Ed it. Very dark songs are.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe if you more old become and something traumatic in your life happened is - for example if one a family member or a friend lost - influenced that your artistic creating and your music and both song embody that unambiguously for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">I am however also the view that one can be a happy person and can make nevertheless dark music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Park or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects are seen of the quarrellings over the honorariums with the announcement agreed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The municipal announcement over the 16 gates opens the debate over the significance of Collserola in Barcelona on the new.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Middle of the '1980's, to the highpoint of the CorporaciÃ³n Metropolitana disappeared in the meantime de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration its lampoon over the support by Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The pamphlet described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona city.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was compared even in numbers to the Central park of New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the downfall of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many became again the upper limit of Barcelona, for the capital Kataloniens belongs to the few, that does not spread out in north-south-direction, but rather towards the top (mountains) and below (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The classification Collserolas as a nature reserve plays with this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">As an example, the Central park served now no longer, but rather Yellowstone with wild pigs in the roll of the YogibÃ¤rs.</seg>
<seg id="10">One was so far when the city issued in September a giant announcement, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Undoubtedly a gate refers to the draft of a park.</seg>
<seg id="12">That either is so, or someone intends to place gates on the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question stands of even: Collserola, park or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The announcement is not only from organisational point of view, but rather also with regard to a reflection over the city the topic of conversation in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is already almost a rekurrentes subject, on which two members of this old resident box can fall back, who meet in the procession.</seg>
<seg id="16">And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare agreements between that, what three architects think from Barcelona about that, and to some university professors who applied themselves on the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel RoldÃ¡n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The announcement is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For RoldÃ¡n "is it necessary" to speak after the attack on the coast over the "front at the mountains" as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that was not expedited over the green apples.</seg>
<seg id="19">"One should come from the principle that Barcelonas is largest park the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because it is well accessible.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex", judges the architect, for which the title of "gates of Collserola" rescues a "lexical trap" in itself: One may not imagine it "as accesses to a park, but rather as a containment of zones, on which acted will must".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol, like RoldÃ¡n and Bayona with city structural experience, regards the suggestion as one "intellectual challenge" that rescues "some dangers" in itself.</seg>
<seg id="23">Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty, that the formation of a public room nowadays with itself brings" after the experiences out of the '1980's that had its "swan in the area of the forum song".</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is the own containment on that, what may be cultivated.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Something to limit meant always, the next step to determine" to exceed i.e. it.</seg>
<seg id="26">"One must think about new city structural planning instruments, for the present [reference taking on the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead" to a real catastrophe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol, that complies narrower with the question, does not mean simplified, the side of Collserola that goes toward Vallesana, "can than a park understood become, that in direction Barcelona", and to be sure out of purely topografischen reasons.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol does not remember that it gives already a study of the patronage de Collserola, that "on deaf ears knock should" although it gratefully would be to the city administration, that it gave its group the possibility to assist with this project "of the first moment at".</seg>
<seg id="29">Moreover he notices in that the vicinity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter, that enables it the architect to participate in the debate although he expresses its "doubts" on that, whether this technical profile the established multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the correct", says he) guide should "we architects should only a tool be".</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (social insurance institute of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and youth under the title "genetics of the obesity in childhood and youth", with which the genetic markers in connection with excess weight are supposed to be found.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Miguel Cruz LÃ³pez, leader of the Unidad de InvestigaciÃ³n MÃ©dica e BioquÃ­mica (department for medical research, focal point biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro MÃ©dico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team was constructed, consisting of physicians, sick caretakers, nourishment specialists and social workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This team becomes supported Salud PÃºblica (INSP) of specialists and students of the Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de and at the Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto PolitÃ©cnico Nacional (IPN).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The population is participate invited to that in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico where every Saturday from 8.00 clock tests with children and youth are carried out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">It emphasized that the investigation began on the sport field of CuauhtÃ©moc (in the west of the state MÃ©xico) and is continued for the 8th of October on the sport field of NezahualcÃ³yolt (in the East of the state MÃ©xico).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">If the goal is reached by 500 to 600 investigation people, the study is continued on the sport field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and is locked on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">It explained, let the goal of the study be the becoming acquainted with of the factors and the roll of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth to the prevention of chronic degenerativer diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">On the occasion of the worldwide day of the diabetes declared it, it would be striven for that three thousand children and youth in the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under supervision of its parents should fill out nourishment related questionnaires.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Also questions about are placed you its physical activity and its informal illness prehistory to control around risk factors, that could have diabetes or kidney insufficiency as a consequence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It carried out furthermore that at the named Saturdays the investigation people measured (weight, size, waist circumference), its blood pressure controls and determines would become blood value such as the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification of gene in the context with obesity at an early age).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz LÃ³pez emphasized, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the apprehension of the health personnel of person young over the alarming weight increase.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The health surveys out of the years 1999 and 2006 yielded that in almost six years the share of obese boy had increased around 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity around 47 percent. Also the overweight-ness dramatically had increased", emphasized the specialist of the IMSS.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">It indicated, the search for genetic markers would be established because the genetic story of the population of Mexico would differ of of that peoples other.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">It indicated that a (e) mexican (in) in the average to 65 percent would be Indianly More american, to 30 percent More european and to 5 percent of African descent, what would be reflected in the genes, that stand with diabetes and excess weight in the context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Very generally declared it, that genetics of the obesity would express itself in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us so that this would be warehoused in the form of fat.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The researcher explained, who would exist direct utility for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children, with which assessed would become, whether these showed a degree of overweight-ness or obesity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">It would refer even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the nape and at the interior arm (Akanthosis), that to the probability of metabolism interferences and diabetes in the before stage, examines.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">All information confidentially would be treated and would be announced the parents in writing by the physicians. The physicians explain all fair results to the parents and strike them changes of the lifestyle before, that are appropriate to the prevention of diseases.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Cruz LÃ³pez explained, would give it three basic factors, that are responsible for excess weight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: To spend movement deficiency, that is missing movement in the everyday life, most time of the day before the television and to use means of transportation, to go in place of short ways on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The high calorie reception, that is, an increased consumption at gezuckerten drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat reception and protein reception as well as the genetics, that is supposed to be analyzed in this research project.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers in order to make the mixture resistanter vis-Ã -vis weather conditions and variations in temperature</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">If became on the signs, that come from the street coating, respected to not to repair would be it required, almost 200,000 potholes if the rain time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle breaks out de MÃ©xico (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera NÃ¡jera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured considerably diminishes that if the displaying and the maintenance of the asphalt coating would happen appropriate, the amount of the potholes or Even completely avoided become.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In its presentation "potholes from technical point of view", that it held on the occasion of the international year to the chemistry, announced it that the laboratory for which it is responsible would develop with polymers modified asphalts in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, that shows however a larger mechanical resistance both in high like also in low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera NÃ¡jera meant that this type of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate should be used, like for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order to improve the behavior of the street coating and to avoid therewith the appearance of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon connection, of that a part a high molecular weight has - the so named asphaltic - and the other part a low - THE so-called Malthene. Jointly they lend be the street coating characteristic tough elastic behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Tough harvest table behavior of the asphalt meant that this behaves in high temperatures of almost 180Â°C like a fluid, in 120Â°C is it very viscous and in 50Â°C almost firm while it becomes in very low temperatures brittle.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"That is, that the robustness of the asphalt on the streets not uniform is, but rather itself at a day dependent upon the weather conditions and variations in temperature changes", led the chemical engineer from.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researcher of the FQ noted, the streets of Mexico city would have by a majority a flexible street coating, that would consist of six material layers, of which the last three asphalts included.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the uppermost layers, a wear layer out of asphalt, that would lie hardened would consist of small, in asphalt of bathed and then stones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each single stone of this wear layer, be bathed become in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles move away themselves on that and powers are produced, this layer enables a good distribution of forces in the street coating.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If it modified asphalt would be, would become the powers itself yet better distribute", meant the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"Over the wear layer", carried out it, "a last layer is displayed, consists, i.e. of sand, that so named base, that out of tiny stones that was bathed also in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because this layer in the contact with the vehicle tires are, they require must produce a larger mechanical power as the wear layer and it friction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">That this street coating most powers receives and distributes, requires must be held the base moreover an appropriate thickness and the material out of which it exists, in place.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather conditions, especially moisture and variations in temperature, are further, important factors to be considered, first and foremost the water", said it, "for it impairs the behavior of the wear layer considerably.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the terrain becomes damp, water penetrates into the layer and emerges only hard again. That causes a softening of all layers of the street coating and as a result the appearance of potholes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a pothole emerges", said it, "becomes first of all the cover layer worn out while the wear layer is impaired first after that. But the damage does not emerge immediately, but rather it concerns held become must a process, that in the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs in place".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load would be a further important cause for the appearance of potholes. Therefore the thickness of each layer of the street coating had to stand always in the relation to the vehicle load and would have to be guaranteed it that to the avoidance by frequent potholes this regulation is kept.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera referred wait let on that, that yet many research projects to itself, for example over Asphaltemulsionen, that would be in other countries even already on the market, and with which the potholes let repair themselves simply and without application of high temperatures.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Again once Valle del Cauca went out empty in the award of the crown for Miss Colombia.</seg>
<seg id="5">This time therewith satisfied had to give itself Melina RamÃ­rez Serna to stand on the winner platform, a silver crown and the volume, that expels it as new Miss Colombia, to place to the show.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">With the result preserved this night in Cartagena where Miss AtlÃ¡ntico took the crown and the cedar at itself, comes associates itself the Departamento already on 14 Misstitel and Melina to the legion by women out of Valle del Cauca, that had held the crown nearly in the hands. Belong to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara DomÃ­nguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Ãlvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga MarÃ­a arena (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), MÃ³nica Evers (1989), MarÃ­a Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), g sharp yard of GarcÃ©s Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie GarcÃ©s Aljure (2008).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The large question that today many stand reads: What was missing?</seg>
<seg id="8">For the result corresponds to the decline of a large favorite that had shown in every demonstration that it controlled everything in order to be the new Miss Colombia. For nothing it had not been selected to the queen of the police and to the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, took title, that also the beauty queens had received Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and that itself the crown of the Miss Colombia home.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Does the first factor, that apply as decisively to the decision of the jury, of appointing it to the first Miss, is, influenced that it the answer to the question "which book you most strongly and why"?, that its of MartÃ­n Murillo GÃ³mez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos placed become was, not convinces had.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman out of Valle del Cauca reciprocated the questioner:</seg>
<seg id="11">"I read much, I believe rather in the literature, I believe, it is itself a type to civilize, believe last of all I that the book that stamped for my childhood most strongly is, `Der small prince', a quite deeply going book.</seg>
<seg id="12">Currently I read `Schuld and would long'. It is a book of the universal culture that we should read everyone. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a russian, a beautiful book that is named `Leidenschaften'.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Civilize an answer that bumped against love into few first because of the term `sich and secondly because it had not explained concretely, on which manner of each had influenced of its book named it.</seg>
<seg id="14">Melina declared but after conclusion the ceremony to feel quietly and happily with the result: "The universe is would show, it happens, what must happen.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all people: Reads please a little `Den of small prince'. It is a magnificent book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among other things is said that the favorite is burned out by el Valle.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist out of Bogota did not indicate that the fact was, that it the preferred, that everyone of by cases had got einheimste and that in the forefield all prices, (gastronomy competition Oster, audience voting over the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously made had, what the queen stresste, that therefore on the stage shine could".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">One noticed and that in its first presentation in the bathing suit at the beach of the Hilton hotel and in both processions in the culmination celebration.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although it certainly appeared in both, was missing its yet the power and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and AtlÃ¡ntico to the show placed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como e casa" in the canal RCN did not mean that the fact was crowned, that Melina to the Miss, "shows, that the candidate, that during the competition most prices wins, in the end yet queen becomes".</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover Valle to the end of the press went out of the way - an error.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">A further hypothesis is that Valle was not able to convince the Jurie regarding its interest for the social work, what last of all the essential of the national beauty competition is.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will have already its reason that two days explained Lucy Doughty before the grouping of the international jury, they sought a woman who was committed to the social matters of its country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty alone suffices for a Miss Colombia not. One must look out over the physical and must concentrate on the social perceiving, participate cooperated had on that, that it already before that in the competition on projects", explained it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is speculated also that Valle with its defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose, that one noticed in its in the stomach area, had sinned. But that is contradictory, for the jury selected it as a candidate for `natÃ¼rliche beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The trainer of the queens, Jorge HernÃ¡n Orozco, admits that Melina had not the best body, that there would be better, "but its problem with the Fibrose at the belly, that for me honestly said hardly to note was, pressed its score at the last day".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In the meantime the journalist Guido Hoyos of the periodical Cromos of the view, the mistake of the woman is had been out of Valle del Cauca the surgical intervention which she had subjected herself.</seg>
<seg id="28">"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how it correctly should make let it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Your body never was its strong side, and it had to pay this place".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this price, that will forgive the first time of the national beauty competition, a cruel prediction, that should become in the night true, emerged after the entrance in the bathing suit. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a comfort price in order to not let come it into the enjoyment of the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Equal whether that agrees or is not, fact that Melina begins from today its domination year, to be sure to not to represent as a queen, but rather as a princess, a position, who offers its the possibility, on appointment of the national beauty competition Colombia with one of the international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">To be sure it becomes as one of the queens, that in spite of its overwhelming entrance for Cartagena the crown had escaped, in which story go in.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Canadians live in denial of death how out of a report of the royal company of Canada follows</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The group explained that governments to place collaborated, institutions of the hygiene and physicians with respect to analgesic treatment around the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian company lives in a denial bearing vis-Ã -vis death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of the Canadians admit die would want and meet actually on that to speak with its physician over conditions, under which it dispositions to this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report the royal company of Canada at which six experts were involved, who are connected on different areas of expertise, among other things ethics, right and medicine, together.</seg>
<seg id="7">This group recommends the government to alter the criminal law so, in order to permit accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice stands, and to make to be sure with patients, who are looked at as in a position, such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As a prelude, the experts quote a survey published recently of the independent company EIU that had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe together.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada placed itself herewith on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical dead care in Canada produced a culture, in which the people have anxiety to cut" the subject of death.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to analgesic means, report ordered that of the royal company of Canada experts to us.</seg>
<seg id="11">And in spite of the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home, die however in the end 68.6% of this in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">Of the entire country here observed the rate with 86% is at deaths entered in the hospital in the Quebec most highly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the delicate question regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report to conclusions come, that of the position of the federal government which already has to want no changes at all of the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide of distinguished, arranged contrary to are.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Now however there is loudly the expert who inspected all those countries, whose extension legalizes euthanasia and accompanied suicide or have entkriminalisiert, no proof at all that such an Entkriminalisierung would not stretch into its application, therefore the practice execution of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of unkompetenten or consenting people after.</seg>
<seg id="15">To the contrary meet substantially more cases of such infraction just in the countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalizeed, how yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosigner of the report confirmed, in a videophone conference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia becomes in Canada where it is unambiguously illegal, practice".</seg>
<seg id="17">"Also accompanied suicide becomes in Canada practice, although here unambiguously illegally", explains Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians advocate the euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Let's imagine that loudly one in 2010 carried out Angus-Reid-surveys of already 85% the Canadians for the benefit of the euthanasia had itself, because they are of the opinion, this would allow us it people at the end of its journey through life to soften its sorrows.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the circumstance of a legalization of the euthanasia would not have as a consequence to mediate the message that life of older or hindered people less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">With respect to the people, who have already an accompanied suicide practice, the questioned represent the opinion to 41% that these should be pursued not criminal.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">What concerns maintenance or attitude of the means with patients, represents itself situation as fewer clearly, so the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as these in its recommendation index suggest that in the criminal law indicated become should, that the dropping of the means, for which a legal rejection had produced, should not count, as criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The expert group demands in addition that specialists of public health should be educated in the task of respecting a dropping of the means at the end of life, and this without criminal pursuit fear to must.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The group explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and physicians collaborated with respect to analgesic treatment in order to place the best analgesic means ready, and this also over the cancer cases going out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Finally the group with respect to the means long-range used already in the Canadian institutions to the hygiene to pain relief or this demands to pull at least in deliberation because these served just as few like the euthanasia in addition to reduce physical pains and this on the same procedures would relate themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Reserve other experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts on the right zone of public health proposed already reservations with respect to the conclusions of the expert report of the royal company of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, has the bearing of the report lower drawing experts among other things as" extremely" designated, suffer would set because these the euthanasia practice in in the final stages no boundaries at all.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the gates for a situation, in that each, that suicidal and older than a 18 years is, another person to ask, it in its suicide helpful to be", so RA Deschamps that yesterday a summary of the report had looked through.</seg>
<seg id="31">RA Deschamps emphasizes also, the authors of the report seemed to place the individual responsibility of the single over all other values, that are involved in the social Gewirke of the company.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Now however, says it, would give it" guidelines and obligations in a company".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, expressed also" a strong resistance" vis-Ã -vis the conclusions of the report, that called it as" per-euthanasia-manifesto".</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, that is even member of the royal company of Canada, does not dispute especially the report statement regarding the model of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalizeed, like for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="1">Energy politics:</seg>
<seg id="2">Facts should win over dogmas</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">If a subject exists that on basis by short-term views or on the basis of emotions treated will not may, this is certainly the energy politics.</seg>
<seg id="4">Availability and costs of the electricity influence the buying power as well as the competitive stature of the businesses in direct.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is sensible to take a choice meeting to the occasion, to think about this subject as well as over the position of the atomic energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will carry only then fruits if it probes the entirety of more economic, social and ecological consequences of the proposed option.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Frenchmen should underpin its opinion on objective facts, rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Although 7 billions of person are on this planet, the demographic evolution pushes a doubling of the electricity demand to the year 2050, should forgo must not an enormous share of the world population a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">Simultaneously one must soften the shortage of the fossilized resources in order to be able to produce further steadily electricity, without forgetting the compelling necessity to the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, a subject disappeared out of the ecological debate,, in order to struggle against climatic.</seg>
<seg id="10">The accident of Fukushima changes no this parameter.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore blebt Germany further in its decision isolates to forgo nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is neither the case in Belgium, that subjects its decision of the necessity, of finding a substitutionsfÃ¤hige replacement source, yet in Switzerland, that intends just once only nuclear power plants of the last generation to construct.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Finland, Poland, the Czech republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil in order to name only some countries, pursue its projects on the other hand further with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States concluded would paint take on their part after Fukushima to incorporate its park a further unit, in that it the work shut down after the atom accident Three Iceland again in operation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also if the model directed, German on renewable energy sources is placed occasionally as an example, reality contradicts however the discourse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The choice in Berlin will find expression in form of an increase of the electricity price, a dependence reinforced energetic by the increased recourse to import gas especially of Russia, a climb of that of CO2-Emissionen caused by gas power plants and coal power plants.</seg>
<seg id="17">The entirety of these unpleasant effects noticeably will make itself already within less months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case Denmark gives occasion for meditation.</seg>
<seg id="19">Denmark is on the one hand European table leader with respect to wind power, out of which it relates 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the strongest users of coal and gas is used, alternating with wind power; aufgrunddessen are its CO2-AusstÃ¶sse as well as its electricity price respectively around 65% and 50% higher than the average value corresponding European.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the constancy of our energy politics, our neighbors pay one in contrast to our French households around 40% higher electricity calculation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because the energy price in the globalized economy represents a key roll of the competitive stature as well as a StabilitÃ¤tspfand of the industry on national ground, the franzÃ¶sichen businesses have an advantage based on the most favorable electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">Each significant reduction regarding the nuclear power would stretch therefore a strong growing of the energy price after, what let say become the noble about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defense of the buying power the illusion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Surveys yielded that that would be a price to pay that the majority of the Frenchmen just as few ready is how it lets recognize resistance against the principle of this energy source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let's imagine us that the energy politics of our country enabled it to construct a branch of industry jobs direct and 410,000 induced with 125.00.</seg>
<seg id="25">Based on its strong export character, it brings an enormous quantity of specialized small and middle-class businesses on the international markets and makes this of jobs innumerable to creators.</seg>
<seg id="26">If France should grasp the decision to get off of the nuclear power, would fall victim that a this KMU, and the annual 6 billions of Euro at capital goods export and atomic energy export would dwindle more and more.</seg>
<seg id="27">Which electrician would delegate an EPR conceived for functioning on sixty years if the decline of its maker is preprogrammed?</seg>
<seg id="28">To solve around the energetic equation one must clear that there is just as few a like a devil work a miracle means to the production of electricity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">That of the firm Areva developed, CO2-armen solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy witness of the complementarity of the energy sources.</seg>
<seg id="30">To received the highest possible security level uprightly an absolute imperative is for the nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a security authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections in already existing works such as for example at the building in Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whose work teams, that made itself based on its professionalism a name, are of the security presentation just to possessed.</seg>
<seg id="33">Within 50 years, the kernel industry experienced three serious disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only a more only, and to be sure in Three Iceland would paint, entered under normal operating conditions; so it passed without consequences for person and environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Tschernobyl, the drama through reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure was conjured up.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident never was evoked by two natural disasters existence size, that caused death of several ten thousand people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The kernel industry will pull its apprenticeships just as out of this accident how it had done according to this both preceded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">As a fruit of this procedure as well as a cooperation of the security authorities the French and German operators and designer of nuclear power plants, represents the EPR a design, that enables it robustness vis-Ã -vis such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because it is considered under the electrical engineer as desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, a building stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift at the competition of Areva and EDF in that one would let them clear track to tear the lead in the unavoidable nuclear power development at itself.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is indispensable and legitimate to search for the best Energiebouquet for our country, however it would be irresponsible, emotions let dominate dogmas and ParteimanÃ¶ber a debate, the just as economic, social and financial situation of our country determiniert.</seg>

<seg id="1">Is immigration load or chance for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The immigration politics led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized out of angles multifarious - overload by police organs, court organs and administration organs based on a politics subjected to the numbers, compatibility of this politics with the status one "country of the human rights" how France itself had entitled itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently the annoyance arranged against foreign students by official side had stamped the newsreel, had announced the Secretary of the Interior incidentally (see LibÃ©ration of the 23rd of May), compel would have that France" no talents, mason or waiter out of foreign countries".</seg>
<seg id="4">But this politics became only rarely of the economical viewpoint out of analyzed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Over this subject, a long-range consent between rights and left rules namely.</seg>
<seg id="6">Of right side, the tone was struck of Jacques Chirac, represent might that 1976 had explained, that" the 900,000 unemployed, under that over 2 million immigrated labor forces, no problem for a country", by left side by Michel Rocard, that 1990 had represented, France" the entire poverty of the world could not receive".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Only difference exists in the degree of that</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fear of the invasion of the national ground through hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 both of to the right and of to the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">Of both warehouses, the immigrants were perceived as a load for the economy and the French company.</seg>
<seg id="10">The single difference exists to admit is in that just that that one vis-Ã -vis the immigrants willing.</seg>
<seg id="11">Francois get countries is restricted would permit in its program to banality, that refer on that, based on partnership development it to solve our" migration problems".</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This presentation of immigration as a load when problem, can affect possibly the choices; however is it economically costly.</seg>
<seg id="13">How the economy experts imagine us Ian gold and Geoffrey Cameron in a work appeared recently, that the newest insights regarding the immigration summarizes (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our world and wants Define Our future, May 2011, Princeton University of press, 352 S.), existed under the specialist a wide consent with respect to the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">To restrict the immigration the growth would weaken and would damage the labor market situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears vis-Ã -vis the influence of the migrants are based on the presentation that these threaten to replace the domestic labor forces, especially that more slightly qualified, in that they exerted pressure on its wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows however that the immigrants in truth are substantially more complementary than as the domestic laborers, because they exercise occupations in sectors, that are job technical not at full capacity.</seg>
<seg id="17">The slightly qualified immigrants work work in sectors, that domestic laborers excite few, the more qualified under the immigrants in dynamic sectors, in which the education is not adjusted the work offer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive wage effect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Just as as a surgeon difficulties have would become to work in a country, in which a lack rules of anesthesiologists, this complementarity causes also a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs between domestic and migrant on wages and domestic labor market situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri calculated on this type and manner that a 1 %- iger climb of the immigrant flood would induce a with included, long-term increase of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And this without consideration of the fact that the variety brought in by the immigrants of the idea creation as well as the economic growth is beneficial (high share of naturalized immigrants under American noble prize winner; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBAY and Yahoo became of immigrants established).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants contribute also net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about in a height of 1% of the entire household.</seg>
<seg id="23">The world work organization appreciates for example that a person immigrating at the age of 30 years to Germany brings in the public household in the average over its lifetime a net contribution (revenue minus editions) by about 150,000 Euro.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wished to induce the missing intersections to start of its mandate" with the teeth".</seg>
<seg id="25">These purported teeth that the immigrants should deter obtained however exactly the contrary effect.</seg>

<seg id="16">It is entirely Europe, that bends itself the dictation of the markets and the Ratingagenturen, that suffers from its faint and its solidarity deficiency.</seg>
<seg id="17">It is entire Europe that is humbled on more international plain.</seg>
<seg id="18">One is disturbed over sovereignty transfer toward Europe - at the same time is it entire Europe that loses gradually its sovereignty, and therewith each single of the nations incorporated it.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1">North Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The gas pipeline north Stream, that passes on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly with Russia, was set in operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should gas for an equivalently of 30 million households deliver.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with brightness and Gloria.</seg>
<seg id="5">Over 500 loaded guests, under that four heads of state and heads of the government, attended last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under Orchesterbeschallung and in Feinschmeckerbuffet the inaugural of the new gas pipeline north Stream, that interconnects Russia and Germany below sea level directly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, that Russian PrÃ¤sident Dmitri Medwedew, the French prime minister FranÃ§ois Fillon as well as its office colleague mark Rutte out of the Netherlands have symbolic would prove the tax the valve jointly turned, which conveys the Russian gas into the west european network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billions of cubic meter of additional Russian gas are supposed to be delivered by a first piping of 1,224 km lengths, that connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second piping, that allows an entire delivery of 55 billion cubic meters gas - that equivalently the French entire consumption - is supposed to be placed end 2012 ready.</seg>
<seg id="9">And one lets be discernable already the eventuality of the building of a third direction on self stretch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely and point exact completion of this enormous building such as a victory causes.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project was strongly disputed in Poland and the Baltic countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">The north-Stream-pipeline will enable namely a direct gas delivery to Germany, and to be sure under avoidance of each line course through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country way.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason lose both countries a few of its power: For it, it becomes now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia in that they threaten to close the access to west european markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw, most strongly in the debate engages, was not before that back shy to compare the north-Stream-pipeline to a "new German sowietischen pact" in involvement at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means, politically seen is that the subject sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe won an even higher provision security through the approval of this Russian project.</seg>
<seg id="17">This however on costs of a debility of European energy because the project struck a breach between west European and east European.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia brought it in hardly five years ready, its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and that pass to put through western countries, that show strong gas consumption and whose gas occurrence draws to a close.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery, that us on organic type and manner connects", confirmed are important FranÃ§ois Fillon in the inaugural of the gas pipeline in that it referred on that, in which straight the gas contracts also of political and economic side.</seg>
<seg id="20">All this declared the wide smile of the Gazprom manager represented in Lubmin in great numbers with respect to the gas pipeline.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The building of this gas pipeline is also an exceptional technology.</seg>
<seg id="22">The lower water pipe consists of steel with concrete casing, that should protect it against Schiffsankern.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed, in approximately 200 ms depth.</seg>
<seg id="24">In its building had to be avoided out of the second world war dating mine fields.</seg>
<seg id="25">"About hunderte mines as a precaution had to remove or destroyed become", gave Jens MÃ¼ller, speaker of the company north Stream, on.</seg>
<seg id="26">Reinforced had to be seized to the protection of the fauna and Flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The direction is a long snake out of metal, heavily like 242 EiffeltÃ¼rme, that is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither through valves, yet maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsible took therefrom distance because the Sweden were eager few on that to see establish themselves a Russian country company on permanent type and manner on height of its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the case a loss by sea close we the gas passage in less than a minute", specified Jens MÃ¼ller.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the case a leak, the gas present itself in the gas pipeline escapes therefore into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">This case probably is looked at of the designers however as only few because that was estimated to be a constancy by a leak per 100,000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The national supervision of the gas pipeline becomes both guarantees of a lower water robot, that is driven to external Observationszwecken by a lake ship out of, how also of a device, that circulates in the interior of the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">It possesses the form of a cigar, a meter of diameter, is introduced the piping in that in and moves away through the gas pressure.</seg>
<seg id="34">After three complete days of the locomotion through the direction in a speed of 3 meters per second, delivers the device information most exact in its arrival about possible deformation of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The gas pipeline was conceived subjected become in order to function for fifty years, without so much as the slightest repair to must.</seg>
<seg id="36">The gas circulation is guaranteed very simply through pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">This amounts to 200 cash at the access, 100 cash at the exit point.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies united its powers to the realization of this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The direction leadership remains however in the hand of Gazprom, that holds 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">Further the German companies are incorporated here E. ON and BASF (ever to 15,5%), just as as the Dutch gas university and the French firm group GDF suez (ever to 9%).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies formed a business partnership, that names itself north Stream and that is delegated with the building as well as business of the gas pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has its seat in train in Switzerland where the taxation is especially favorable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom rented then this company the entire capacity of its gas carrier, and to be sure on verlÃ¤ngerbaren twenty-year-contract.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom becomes for the entire capacity pay, equal like that honestly would transport gas quantity precipitates", specified Jens MÃ¼ller.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the gas pipeline building was protected to 30% of stockholders as well as to 70% through bank lending.</seg>
<seg id="46">The entire cost of labor should amount to itself on 7.4 billion Euro for both pipings.</seg>
<seg id="47">For GDF suez the investment sum amounted to for example 240 million.</seg>
<seg id="48">The minority stockholders are to be overtaken here themselves however its expense again because Gazprom carries alone the liability risk.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The gas pipeline steps at a sandy coast stroke wooded with jaws in Lubmin out of the Baltic Sea to light.</seg>
<seg id="50">Valves high the 4.5 meters form the gas retirement gate.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further indices of the arriving gas before this is forwarded into the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">For last Tuesday this terminal with a million cubic meter of Russian gas is supplied per slipping away hour.</seg>
<seg id="53">In full capacity, these would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 millions per years 2012.</seg>

<seg id="9">"Nevertheless much to do" remains yet enormously.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">It must be said however that for the hindered unemployed further numerous hindrances remain, before they get a job.</seg>
<seg id="11">More frequently it encounters the older: 37% are older than a 50 years (17% in the average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They control a slight qualification level: No graduation examination and it have be 80% of them only 10,000 hindered under the 2.3 million students with higher development conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="13">In conclusion also the long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% in the hindered vis-Ã -vis 38% in the entire cut.</seg>
