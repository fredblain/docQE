Argumentative plan of an oil pipeline is reworked after danger by delayed US approval
Few days, after the Obama's government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada in the golf of Mexico with which one annoyed the trade unions and calmed at the same time environmentalist the enterprise building the pipeline tries hard to plan anew the project, so that one can return again to the normality.
TransCanada said on the Monday evening that one diverts the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The enterprise announced the decision in a press conference in the parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the enterprise is confident furthermore which is approved the pipeline at last, even if with an other course.
Moreover it came after an announcement of the foreign ministry last week after which one would adjourn a decision with regard to a federal licensing for the project one, until the new possible course would be checked which avoids the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a big unterwater supply.
"This is a real step at the head", said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared with fox terrier news.
The new environmental examination which has arranged the foreign ministry may adjourn a decision till 2013, after the elections next year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained the last week in a written explanation that the decision is a job of the foreign ministry and promised his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline became Canada with the golf of Mexico connect.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
Moreover the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but job markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators of Nebraska who are to be forced against the plan weigh the laws, around a turning away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main spring of drinking water and irrigation.
The topical study to the influence on the environment of the foreign ministry has found out that the project would have only little influence on the environment, but the spring of the energy industry says that the main examiner of the ministry has requested for a separate probe of the examination procedure which concentrates upon two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was put by TransCanada, Paul Elliott who was 2008 advisers of Hillary Clinton is in a conflict of interests.
The other is whether an enterprise which was asked to carry out the original study was an immoderate choice, because she stands with TransCanada in connection.
