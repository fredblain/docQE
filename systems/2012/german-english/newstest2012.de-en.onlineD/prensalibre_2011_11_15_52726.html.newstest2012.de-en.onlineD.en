Colom vouches for the delivery Portillos in the United States
The president of Guatemala, Á lvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday, he would grant to the delivery of the former governor Alfonso Portillo, so that this justifies itself in the United States for the conspiracy to the money-laundering of 70 million US $.
Thus ends the process about the application of the USA for delivery of Portillo, so that this can be put there in court.
Colom confirmed in a press conference, his decision founds on the independence of judiciary and government taking into account that a decision-touching court had already arranged the delivery.
He stressed that he has not interfered during his government with judicial rulings and all requests for extradition of which he was informed, has granted.
Except Portillo are delivered to Sergio Ruano Marroquín because of murder and heavy physical injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both because of drug trafficking.
The action of Colom is a government act which occurs if all judicial and constitutional-juridical authorities are exhausted to the conviction of the former Staaatspräsidenten (in 2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the fifth Criminal Court and the constitutional court of Guatemala Portillo must be delivered if his legal situation is cleared in Guatemale and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the embezzlement of 120 millions Quetzales in the ministry of defence during his reign. These negotiations walked at the head of the delivery, but the minister inserted contradiction and animated the case anew.
