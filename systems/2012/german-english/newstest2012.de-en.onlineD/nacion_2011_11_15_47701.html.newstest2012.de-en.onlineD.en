The quintet included Costa Rica in his tour to the celebration of his 20-year-old existence
"In Costa Rica is to be played a dream which is realised"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva the bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the tape is prepared to give one of her best concerts on the next Sunday in the national stadium.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the tape were assured that for them a dream is realised if they play in Costa Rica.
This assured the bassist and cofounder of the group, Jeff Ament, the Viva the last week of Brazil from an exclusive interview gave.
The tape is in the South American part of her tour to the celebration of her 20-year-old existence and on Sunday, 20., they make her only stop in Central America.
On this day they step from 19.30 o'clock in the national stadium together with the volume The X from Los Angeles and picked up Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an extract from the conversation whose entire copy is to be found in the on-line issue by La Naci√≥n.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream is realised if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware what means for your fans?
In Costa Rica is to be played a dream which is also realised for us.
This is just once the second spot that we play in South America and Central America, and till present it has been wonderful.
I have been only once to the vacation in Costa Rica. It is such a wonderful country that we will remain certainly a few more days there.
For us it is thrilling to bring our music there.
I ask to you this because the fans the volume are proved to be complete. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say your eager Estonians fans?
Thanks to stand all these years on our side.
We have used nearly 21 years, until we have come to Costa Rica. To have waited thanks, so long and we are sorry to have used so long, until we have come here.
Some people believe even that your concert will become the biggest show of the year.
Does a little pressure from your visit not exercise?
Some of the most wonderful shows which we have put down during the last 21 years took place during the last both weeks.
Us have played on a few gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and hope us that to us have made fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have to play desire there.
We love this country, we surf with pleasure and are inspired by the jungle. For it Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world.
How have you got to know Costa Rica and his waves for surfing?
Many of our friend are surfers and I have a wonderful friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends have always gone for surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for surfing. In this manner, about the people who love surfing we have got to know from it.
With a look at the tour have offered her gigantic shows with many songs.
Which plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we have never played there, we also set to ourselves no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer a good and many-sided repertoire to our fans.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe, this is partly in such a way because we have nine records and can play more than 120 songs. Everybody likes another song, so that the decision which we will play in each case is not easy.
If we take up two or three songs which we have not played long since any more in the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they call the reasons in the memory to us, why we have liked these songs. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore, also for the audience.
With this tour her your 20-year-old history celebrates.
If you look back, does it hard fall to you to your success to believe?
Yes, totally.
First once I think that nobody has presented itself of us to play once in a wonderful rock band, and still more than 20 years. This works like a dream.
We also place further on this blessing and find great to be able to play music as yet together.
We like each other and are enthusiastically to produce music.
We have luck to be able to go to the places of the world which we wanted to visit always.
The things could stand not better.
What did it mean for you to have taken part actively in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big tapes.
We are good with the people of sound guards, Mudhoney and Alice in grove C friendly.
It is astonishing and richly unusual if a movement arises from a group of friends.
Every now and then a volume arises from a town, but it is quite unusual if five or ten groups come at the same time from the same town.
We are proud of it and feel honoured to be a part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in grove C and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound guards on her tour. We are glad to be friends still with them to all and it honours us to be a part of this arisen Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a volume has stayed together like they your time so long with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us already play together for 21 years and Weakly (Cameron) bumped 13 years ago to us. This is just much more time than outlast a lot of tape.
First once I think that we count ourselves happy everybody to be alive still and, moreover, we look around each other.
We everybody are a narrow friend, which is why musical ways have presented themselves which give the freedom to the experimentation to every singles.
One trusts the other and his music. We could not be better.
Your respect with the fame has not always been easy. On the other side you could make thanks to your success always this what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The kind, as we have grown, has made to us easier to find a balance.
We guarantee not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy, to this play with the gigantic human masses which love your music to go to ruin.
As long as one remembers that the people have come because of the music, reminds you in it that you must respect the music and that what she has brought to life be without crazily on it to to be a famous rock star. This has never interested us anyway.
Which recollections do you have to your other project Mother Love Bone?
I believe, we have written very good songs and at first it was wonderful.
We were during three years a volume which had never published a record up to the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have used so long. We are still good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built up the tape with us, makes friends. If I hear a song or see photos, I remember what unbelievable person Andy was and how he brought me to the laughter. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other subjects.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The home tape Reading Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it right that her her works know, have selected in particular Eddie Vedder, and the tape, therefore, for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this tape best of all. Therefore, we are to be seen curious what Reading Robertas can offer live. This becomes exciting certainly.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter always when you play live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no notion.
He sings him, and I believe, he sings the first what occurs to him.
By whom were you influenced as a bassist?
From so to many +
Geezer butler, John Entwistle, C belong to the first who occur to me. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
These are so many that I could talk the whole afternoon about the bassists whom I like.
How has it created Pearl Jam to hold the Grunge in the life, although it does not concern any more a fashion appearance?
I believe, we everybody do not feel very much linkedly with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, occur to me the tape which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, sound guards, nirvana and all the others which arose at the same time. If they are also important even today, I find this wonderful, because it is worthwhile this music to hear and now tape like Mudhoney play better music than ever before.
In the beginning her music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I believe, there are a few songs on the new album which could look a little bit frivolous. But there are also other songs like The or Precisely Breathe which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have of some positive in themselves.
To both the tears came to me when I heard like Ed she played. These are very dark songs.
I believe if you become older and something traumatic has happened in your life - e.g. if one loses a member of the family or a friend - this influences your artistic creating and your music and these both songs embody unambiguously for me.
However, I also take the view that one can be a happy person and even though play dark music.
