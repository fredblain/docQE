"Coldly and inhumanly": Differently Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Differently Behring Breivik, the man who has stood two amok runs with which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed has described to himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as an "opposition" fighter.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian opposition movement and a temple knight of Norway", he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection against the court, because you have received your mandate from organisations which support hatred ideologies and because is thereby supported of the Multikulturalismus."
"I recognise the laws, but I do not confess guilty."
Judge Torkjel home Nes interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he did not want to give "Breivik the possibility to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For same reason he refused Breivik which brought a speech written to begin with to turn to the permission, at the end of the hearing to the members of his victims.
Moreover, home Nes arranged that the police of Breivik keeps for 12 other weeks in pretrial detention, he has no access to the media four weeks. He said that the authorities exactly control all visits and the whole correspondence more than eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims took part in the hearing.
Some came in hope to be able to see Breivik in the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that he remains behind castle and bolt.
Everybody took part with the aim that everything runs out to locking away.
"I thought, he looks cold and inhuman", told a survivor about Utoya the Norwegian transmitter NRK.
"It was disagreeable, but for me it goes on a piece, after I have seen the suspect and have belonged."
Breivik carried a dark suit and a blue tie and looked quiet during the whole hearing and professional. He looked journalist and survivor in the eyes when he entered the building and left again.
In spite of Breiviks to weird tip, it would be a part of a bigger "opposition" movement, the judge came to the end that he is not demented and said that there was no proof of the fact that he would have had accomplices.
Some may like it that the attacks from the 22nd of July apparently the work of a single extremist was and not of a group of radical.
But does make easier automatically the grief and the confusion which still feels a whole nation?
"I wished, he would look like a monster, but he does not do this", said the member of a victim.
"It would be so much lighter if he did it."
