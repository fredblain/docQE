The menace is handy
After the disclosure of the "Zwickauer of cell" Turkish media doubt the German constitutional state.
A newspaper speaks ferment from a "bloody ideology" which revives now.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and a Greek small enterpriser in the years from 2000 to 2006 had a background of the extreme right.
To this news it is reacted in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry.
Since for many German Turks one longest ghost presumed dead returns with it: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November, 1992 and in Solingen in May, 1993 there has been no comparable power with background of the extreme right more against Turks.
The fact that there is hostility to foreigners in Germany, never stood, nevertheless, in question.
Nevertheless, the uncovered network of the extreme right reveals magnitude whose dimension is not still foreseeable long ago.
"Does the bloody ideology revive again?" headlined the Internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", however, stresses that one of the culprits a V man of the protection of the constitution should have been, and is concerned that also German authorities could be involved in the radical right-wing marsh.
Sensibly there reacted the Turkish municipality of Germany: She reminded on the week-end with a Mahnwache before the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist power.
Only two weeks before the Turkish municipality had thought in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In happy colours the cooperation had been produced - as a history of the success.
Like a box on the ears the reporting of some of the Turkish media works there: "Present of Germany to the fiftieth" the heading of an article is in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X" which reports the backgrounds of the murder series.
Also the Germany issue of the "Hürriyet" insists it on pulling this mental connection.
"It catches in to stink", the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci is called.
He stresses in the fact that people have been murdered who would have paid taxes and would have made with her work an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
Extremely critically the action of the police and their late search success is discussed in German Turkish Internet forums.
Why it has not rather occurred to the German authorities already a lot to look in circles of the extreme right for suspects, the authors surprise.
Some one is at least rhetorically to drastic means ready: "It is sloppy here furthermore, nothing else is left to the migrants than the self-defence and the arming".
"This will probably be the best self protection".
"The internal peace depends very strongly on the goodness of the clarification and propriety of the punishment of the whole network in Germany", writes "selenium".
What means it if the internal peace is in danger in Germany, the posters of Mölln and Solingen made clear in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Since no other event showed the Turk living here more clearly that there is a handy menace, and the German that mistrust and distance can flow into rightwing violence.
Nevertheless, the posters sharpened the we-feeling on Turkish side.
The mistakes of the past do not repeat
At that time in the Turkish press above all the failure of the German politics was criticised after the posters: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack of Solingen he sent a telegramme of condolence to the Turkish president, can be represented on the memorial service in Cologne, however, by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - at that time Kinkel enumerated in his speech how many deliveries performed the local Turks.
Completely in such a way as if the value of a person calculates itself after the height of his tax deliveries.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the local rule of law since that time.
This time beside the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of the radically right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs open words.
