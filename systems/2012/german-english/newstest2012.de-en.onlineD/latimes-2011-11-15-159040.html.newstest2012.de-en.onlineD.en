Boeing pulls ashore record order of 18 billions dollar
Airline emirates orders 50 2 current airplanes of the type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 other airplanes.
Moreover, Boeing six Boeing Dreamliner sells air, a business to the value of more than 1 billion dollar to Oman.
It is really rare news that an enterprise gets an order more than 50 pieces of his products.
But it is a big deal, if the enterprise of the Flugzeughersteller Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes all together with a record sum of 18 billions dollar lies.
The principal of Boeing is as unusual: the Middle East, a growing golden mine of future airplane orders.
In a forecast which was published on Monday estimates the Chicago enterprise that airlines from the Middle East during the coming 20 years 2,520 airplanes to the value of 450 billions need dollar.
Boeing announced on the week-end his biggest order of all times for commercial airplanes, measured in the value of the order: 50 2 current Boeing 777 Jets.
The hammer order came from the airline of emirate from Dubai.
Moreover, the airline has, Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai aviation show, an option on the purchase of 20 other airplanes which allows to rise the whole list price on 26 billions dollar.
Then on Monday air ordered according to Boeing Oman six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner which improves the mileage and the comfort of the passengers terrifically.
The list price for six these airplanes lies with more than 1 billion dollar.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, stock market expert of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in the possession the oil to producing countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the airplanes. Rather is an increase of the oil prices which damages as a rule to the airlines, because this is one of her biggest matters of expense, not so injuriously, because the country earns on a higher oil price.
This is important, because they tend less than other airlines to cancel airplane orders or to shift if the oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"You have a natural security", he said.
The order of emirate confirms Boeing Leadership position at the market for high-capacity airplanes and helps to keep in check the airbus competitor SAS which attacks the supremacy with the A350.
Boeing Victory on the aviation show there come four months after airbus has announced, one would shift the introduction of the biggest A350 which competes directly with 777-300ER.
One shifted the introduction to win more trust, after the customers had demanded a higher pay load and reach.
The Boeing shares rose by 1.5% on 67.94$.
