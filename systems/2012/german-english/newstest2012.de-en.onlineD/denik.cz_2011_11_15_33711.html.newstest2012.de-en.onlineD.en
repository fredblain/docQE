Development of the travel prices since 1989
Till 1989 there were in the ČSSR at that time only five allowed state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time the travel agencies sold above all merely travelling in the socialist Eastern bloc countries, at that time in the west only chosen were allowed.
And thus Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German democratic republic - the GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula the Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary in the Balaton.
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972 when one might also travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia shaped a prowestern course and, therefore, the trips were strongly limited to Yugoslavia.
It was a big paradox of those socialist times that it was not even allowed to citizens of the Eastern bloc (also the Tschechoslowaken) to travel freely within the scope of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel, for example, individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union, he needed in addition a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not possible for individual travelling.
Even then the travel agencies also offered travelling in the west, then, however, one had to accept gigantic queues or also in the sleeping-bag before the travel agency spend the night, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency have.
Also so the thing had not still run long.
The so-called. Foreign currency assent - the condition on a crossing the border in the west - was given only to "politically reliable" people - the others might not travel at all.
The tschechoslowakische currency was because no freely exchangeable currency, without foreign currency assent it would have been impossible to unearth the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip in the west.
Hence, Czechs most from afar spent her vacation by the home, no miracle that the Czechs bought to themselves countless country houses and Datschen - a habit which continues till this day.
A pilgrim's evolution of the Czechs followed the velvet revolution of 1989 the foot.
While till 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs spent 4.5 millions her foreign holidays in countries of the whole world last year.
An immense paradox which one is not aware today at all is the fact that one could not travel in the holiday country most popular currently of the Czechs - Croatia till 1989 at all because it was a part of Yugoslavia at that time.
Immediately from the beginning of the 90s of the last century in the foreign currency duty was lifted in the neighbouring west-European countries what caused an immense wave of short visits above all to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could not get long time of her trips in the west simply enough, everybody wanted to have been there at least a few days.
Thus the Czech vacationers slept with travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at that time already the money for a lodging at the hotel or in a pension.
At that time a typical sign with foreign tours of Czechs was one with canned food, beer and hard smoked sausage etc. a full-packed boot.
Another important landmark was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists could buy a place the western currency, finally, freely.
Our life level and through this also the average salaries rose what flowed in 1997 into an other important moment.
Thanks to the raised inquiries for travelling the travel agencies after 1997 started to prepare regularly travelling by charter flights by which the flights thanks to the possibility to negotiate amount discounts in comparison to the past incredibly reduced in price.
In the end of the 90s the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already payments without foreign currency with all sophisticated countries of the world had what went on the trip even easier.
At an other interesting moment in the history of the "postal-velvet" holiday traffic it came in 2000 when thanks to the high inquiry the first direct charter flight was dispatched in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Since that time direct charter airplanes with Czech passengers fly annually in far away sunny countries; this year one approaches directly from Czechia twelve exotic destinations.
To 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the epoch which marked our "postal-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On the 17th of November, 2008 the visa duty lifted the USA for Czech tourists by which our country joined definitively among the sophisticated countries of the world.
In 2008 the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of her vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in her history they gave for one single holiday stay including the costs at the holiday place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head from.
