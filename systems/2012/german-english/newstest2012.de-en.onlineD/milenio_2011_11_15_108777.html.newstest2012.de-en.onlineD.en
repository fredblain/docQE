To count out the possibility the votes in Michoacán individually is taken into consideration
According to the information of PREP the difference amounts between the first one and the second place with a choice of governor's just 27 percent and 879 voices of a total of 6074 have not been counted out yet.
The possibility of the single counting up of the votes is this year by the elections in Michoacán a reality, because according to from the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) to spent data the difference between the first and second place by the governor's elections amounts to just 27 percent and 879 voices of a total of 6074 have not been counted out yet.
In this sense the president of the Consejo has reminded general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de off Á ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the fact that just once in past 9th of November the electoral place had dismissed a row of regulations to the harmonisation of the local regulations with the reforms of the federal states in electoral problems.
One reminds of the fact that Michoacán had adapted neither his political constitution nor his electoral law still his law about the electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the congress, so that these were not come into force with this electoral round. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided her publication in the state indicator within the terms intended for it with the argument to have still objections against it.
On the 9th of November the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on the constitutional complaint lodged by the local legislative powers and judged the voice of the state representative to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", because this does not have the right to decide on it "or to insert a veto against it".
María de off Á ngeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of the single counting up of the voices that thanks to the acceptance of the directives by the Consejo general del IEM insisted now the possibility that the local electoral authority can count out the votes partially or completely.
Thus the voices contained in one or several electoral packages can be counted out under the following conditions partially The results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol about the voice counting up and voice calculation is not given according to act or it is not in the possession of the chairperson of the election committee or there are evident mistakes or changes in the protocols.
Moreover, the whole counting up of the completely satisfactory polling cards can occur when there is a difference between the supposed winner and that who stands on the second place which is immediately or more slightly than 1 percent, presumed at the beginning of the meeting an explicit application of the party or coalition-presiding which is the second one of the called candidates is given.
The voice counting up can also occur in her totality if is found out after end of the well-arranged calculation that the difference is between the supposed winner and the candidate on the second place immediately or more slightly than 1 percent, provided an explicit application of a representative of the party whose candidate has become a second is given. In this case the electoral packages which were put out to a partial counting up would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation where according to PREP the difference amounts to just 0.16 percent between the first one and the second place, although the voices of 129 of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not been counted out yet.
