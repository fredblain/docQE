The occupied house in which gigantic parties were organised was removed
The house-owners had taken 11 13 flats in the building in the street Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
Twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without opposition to have performed.
Everything points out to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbours of the house No. 51 have found Balmes an end in the street.
Twelve people left yesternoon voluntarily the building which they had held illegally occupied and in which they had organised gigantic parties which had done the neighborhood to the desperation. The clearing occurred on judicial arrangement without without police intervention.
After the clearing the door lock was exchanged to avoid a similar situation.
"From now the admission will be controlled", confirmed the house supervisor.
The squatters who had taken 11 13 flats of the building - the remaining ones were inhabited - the whole electric arrangement and part of the water supply took. Moreover, they had painted the walls and had left all kinds of garbage, above all tins with alcoholic beverages.
In three lower floors gigantic parties were celebrated which lasted up to two days and which tenants did to the desperation.
Beside the building there is a disco, Balmes 51 which also carried off damages.
Their owner, Maria Pantinat explained Europe Pressing that her business would have decreased since beginning of the house occupation about 80%.
The owner of the disco pointed out to the fact that the squatters made her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the disco.
Moreover, the owner of the leisure bar had been indicated by the neighbours because of disturbance of the peace, while according to her statement the noise was due not to the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the parties who were organised there and became after statements of the angry neighbours during the last weeks more and more and longer.
The person responsible of the disco explained that the nuisance has been so big that she agreed with the owner of the building to have to pay no rent for the last nine months.
Also the Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more discomfort from the neighbours during the last weeks.
The chairperson of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the town council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded the last week to remove the building immediately and to gain control of the problems of the middle-class living together as well as coming down the town quarter.
He explained that before the summer only one floor of the building has been taken, but that the squatters had penetrated during the last months into all floors of the building and almost all flats. In some it had come even to thefts.
In this sense he added that "it is necessary to put an end to the impunity and to reach through against the antisocial actions in the building."
Yesterday another building was removed in the town quarter Nou Barris by the katalonischen police.
At 15.30 o'clock the police approached the street Montral No. 35, after it had received a phone call from a neighbour who had observed how four people wanted to penetrate into the building.
Four were immediately arrested.
