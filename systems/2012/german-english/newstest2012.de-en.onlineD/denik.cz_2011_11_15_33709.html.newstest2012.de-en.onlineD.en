No releasing novella for Tymoshenko by the parliament
Today the Ukrainian parliament refused the application to abolish that section within the scope of a novella of the Criminal Code on whose basis the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The representatives rejected the reorganisation which could have paved the way for the freeing of the imprisoned ex-prime minister with the second reading of the application for alleviation of the punishments for economic offences.
Timoshenko had been condemned in October because of the end of a supposedly disadvantageous contract with Russia about the purchase by natural gas to seven years of custody.
The judgment is not legal yet, in December the appeal of the convicted should be negotiated in court.
Timoshenko itself calls the judgment political revenge of the regime and also in the west the process let arise the suspicion of the prepossession of the court.
The application, section 365 on whose basis the ex-prime minister was condemned to remove from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 representatives.
226 voices would have been necessary to his acceptance.
