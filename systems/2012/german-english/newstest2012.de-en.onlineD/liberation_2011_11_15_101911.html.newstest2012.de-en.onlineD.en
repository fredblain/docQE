Europe has invented the democracy, now remains to think through the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable property; also a sensitive property.
The European continent should be able to remember itself it who left after her invention in Athens more than 2000 years ago the whole 20th century about the tragedies of the First World War, the totalitarianism, the Holocaustes, the gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece about himself.
Some had thought fine, it manages on exercising the right to vote, namely in direktest possible way to see winning the democracy one for all spot about her enemies.
One knows since Napoleon "to the little one" that it concerned a sign of the mentality.
The general franchise which shows necessary condition of the democracy is not for this a sufficient condition and can become as well the "suppression instrument" as it at that time the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public mind, values, an organisation, separation and control of the powers, an education, clarification, economic and social community spirit, an administration of justice.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is an economic crisis, but it is also very much and first of all a politics and democracy crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek true-wrong referendum would have had twice informative character in this regard: once of the need of a powerful return of the politics, on the other side, however, also that of the disconcerting feeling of their impossibility, her Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be judged as outdated.
Truth is that today the front lines of the democratic fight have shifted, and that the republican soldiers, or at least most from them, aim not more in the right direction.
We have to win nothing to press for a success of the domestic referendum which was organised in dependence of the needs and in wrong order.
A free light for the European autocrat or a jump with linked eyes in the emptiness of the nationalistic retreat: A groβartige choice for the citizen!
No, we want cleaver, but a collective job, from full right, mellow and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know, for the rest, already any more, where to finish the enumeration - because there is only one single crisis, and this rules in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe which bends to the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies which suffers from his faint and his solidarity lack.
It is the whole of Europe which is humiliated at international level.
One is disturbed about sovereignty transfer in the direction of Europe - besides, it is the whole of Europe which loses bit by bit his sovereignty and with it every single one of the nations attached to him.
The urgency consists in giving the guidance of the European project back to the hand to the national sovereignty.
Since it has lain in the totality whether the Europeans reduce the load of her debts, from the markets can free themselves and initiate a future by investments.
The climbing out from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition which can be liked not without complete democratic Rechtmäβigkeit without leading us definitely in the downfall.
After this proposal was fought by Jacques Delors and the socialists long time about, today everybody pushes the European economic guidance in addition.
All right.
But itself this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it the citizens have in mind - to introduce would be a renewed folly and an other dead end.
We must take a new stage of European construction on ourselves.
To let arise the republic in France, it required the fact "to create" Republican.
The revolution of the interests only could not perform here is enough.
This instruction remains valid furthermore.
We must form Europe better integrated at economic level.
This can be only reached, while one creates political Europe more democratic seen, a really European national sovereignty.
We need European to create Europe.
