Walls have eyes: As researchers Sie on Facebook observe
Before he became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, different Behring Breivik was only one of many boys whom her anti-immigration opinion sent on-line.
On Monday had Breivik which has been to have committed with an amok run in Norway in July with which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik alone might have acted, he is not by far only in the Cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and has chatted with some of the millions of nationalists who support radically right-wing groups on the part of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
However, how does one find them?
This is light - one must log in only with Facebook.
"We have found out that it was not difficult to come to them", says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOS about the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding place of personal data is so encyclopaedic, Bartlett says that the researchers must simply use the advertising tool of the side to fix her desired demographic data with scientific exactness precisely - as well as it marketers for many years act.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of radically right-wing groups in whole Europe and visierte them then with Adds in, however, instead of themselves with a new volume or a new diet product to verlinken, the Adds the users invited to a survey in whom was asked for her level of education, her position towards power and the appraisal of her own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to confer with more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without they would have had to leave even once her office.
"It is a rather new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. On-line sponsors of radically right-wing groups are mostly young, male and are angry at the immigration.
But in a sort of astonishing twist are "those which infer her on-line activism with an off-line activism more rationally, more democratically and less violently than those which stay down behind her ComputerBild screens."
Demos work is only one example of how Facebook becomes new hot tools in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and politics scientists use the side to study everything, from health questions up to society trends like in "Likes", text news and status actualisations.
With more than 800 millions active users who add on average three contents per day, Facebooks "data supernova" generates a research boom which allowed to rise the number of the scientific works with the name of this side in the title during the last five years by nearly 800%.
For some researchers the beauty of Facebook is the fact that one can study by this side people whom one ordinarily does not reach with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried earlier to question people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to inform first the party and it would never have granted admission to them", says Bartlett.
"With Facebook all that is lost - you go directly to them."
Other say that the side offers a possibility to recognise social health problems and to solve.
A topical study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found out, that the students who discussed her drunken stupor on Facebook, incline significantly stronger to the problem drinking than students who were quiet about this subject.
Moreno suggests, that students of equal standing, for example, the residential advisers who supervise side and help a student, if this too many status actualisations postet.
"You cannot solve a problem if you have not recognised it", said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and leader of the Child Health, Behavior and Development in the Children's Research institutes in Seattle of the Washington Post.
"We have found a possibility to identify threatened children who would not differently have been found."
Moreover, Facebook taps constantly the data of his own population.
The data team of the side has provided statistics about the respect status and Valentinstag, election turnout at the interelections in 2010 and a Nationwide luck index and, primarily, information was used on which only Facebook access has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the side should make her big data goldmine for others for research purposes accessible.)
However, the users about Facebook know that the side observes them whether they want this now or not. Around with a friend who is removed thousands of miles to be able to play Scrabble one allows to the side to propose own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook become a part of a survey about which they do not know yet something?
While researchers have strictly agreed directives as they collect her data off-line, everything is permitted on-line.
"I do not think that many users have thought generally about the fact that a researcher could study her profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist in London Knowledge rennet, to a study from 2006 in which he examined the public sides of students for Facebook.
"What she concerns, it was only about them and her friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodology.
Even off-line there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook it is to be known impossibly, are true how many of the information in a user's profile and in contributions.
"What one says on Facebook and what one makes outside from Facebook, are two absolutely different things", says Selwyn.
Hence, Selwyn in spite of his years thinks as a technology researcher that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools which everybody can use.
"There is no substitute to go out in the real world and to speak with real people", he says.
"Social research must look after the social - and a lot of social life takes place still off-line."
