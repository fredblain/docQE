What does the deception represent with notifications of sickness?
Now after the family allowances UMP and government tackle the notifications of sickness.
Nicolas Sarkozy becomes on Tuesday, arrive 15th of November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance cash and to bring forward a speech about this - already since 2007 always returning - subject of the fight against social deception as well as economic dependence on the state.
To accompany this attack which goes out from the aspiration to submit the economy in a hardness test, on the other side, nevertheless, less herald of an axis of the right presidency campaign does not explain, the majority wants to concentrate upon employee's notifications of sickness.
First with budgetary-economic aim: the government visiert the introduction of the fourth Karenztages before consideration of a notification of sickness with employees in the private sector in.
In well German this means that an ill employee would lose the wage of four days, therefore at least 15% of his monthly income without approval of the specific company.
A Maβnahme which according to the newspaper "Les Echos" Rage threatens to bring on, however would help to introduce 280 million euros.
And the character rather symbolic with another Maβnahme would walk along: for the civil servants to put away an unreimbursed Karenztag in the case of illness (up to now there is for them, in the contrast to three Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).
Meanwhile these questions in the discussion stand, the majority also kindles the deception topic from new one and this time is aimed at the abuse linked with working absence.
"Controls will be substantially more important, and, in addition, these are to be refunded if this is demanded", warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13th of November about the microphone of the transmitter RTL.
As well as in other cases the effects of this announcement concerning the reality of deceitful actions in the area of the notifications of sickness seem a little out of proportion.
Indeed, this is already since 2002 an object of permanent observation as well as political offensives which have yielded most often fruit.
The French are not any more more often ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
If we stay, nevertheless, first with the national figures.
According to the land health insurance scheme CNAM were paid in 2006 more than 237 million euros of day compensations.
Gemä β of the economic research and documentation institute of the health service showed the day compensations in 2008 with 11.3 milliard euros of 5% of the health expenses.
Under this amount 46% fell with regard to maternity vacation as well as work accidents and 54% concerning illness vacations, heiβt 6.2 milliard euros.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health expenses.
In 2010 on an average only 14.5 sick person's days were conceded to the French compared with 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting Gruppe.
An average which covers up certain differences: an another, in 2007 from Monster.com, website for career planning, was published, indicated, that 75% of 40. 000 questioned, French employees gave to have taken no sick person's day.
An another, this time from the health insurance grasped study clarifies that 37% of the notifications of sickness were in 2010 from shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% about that.
Compared to her European neighbours the French employees do not tend more than somewhere else to unfitness for work.
In 2010 from two researchers of the French, state centre for science research (CNRS) controlled long time studie showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (illness empire or otherwise reasonably) oscillated, namely in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The deception with notifications of sickness shows a vanishing low portion concerning the illegal employment.
With regard to the deception only one weak Ausma β is reached here.
The confirmation of the legislation since 2002 brings with itself that there are systmatische controls with notifications of sickness which cross 45 days.
In 2008 has found out the CNAM (public college for education and continuing education of engineers and engineers) less than 1.5 million controls that 13% were 285,000 of the realised, short-term notifications of sickness, heiβt in 37,050 cases", unwarrantedly or too long".
With the systematically controlled notification of sickness cases of more than 45-day duration one counted less than 1.2 millions 11% in "non-conformist or unwarranted" cases, heiβt 132,000.
All together make these 169,000 "unwarranted" cases on several million employees who have asserted a notification of sickness.
A figure which represents only one weak Ausma β towards, for example, that of the illegal employment.
According to UMP-delegated Dominique Tian, author of a material report appeared in July concerning this question, this explains between 9 and 15 milliard euros of tax loss of profit per year, i.e. more than the total expenses in day reimbursements, and therefore substantially more than the Defraudation with last-named.
