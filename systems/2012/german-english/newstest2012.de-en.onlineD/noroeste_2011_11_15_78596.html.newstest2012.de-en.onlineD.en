Climatic adversities braked the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government the unemployment and the illegal employment rose in Sinaloa, while the foreign investments decreased and the economy stagnated.
In 2011 will remain in the economic history Sinaloas in recollection. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez who calls himself the initiator of the change and poked big hopes with regard to the economic growth is in the government. However, as a result of the climatic adversities not the speech can be from growth, but on the contrary the most important economic indicators got worse.
The low temperatures in February caused not only losses in millions in the agriculture, but, in addition, put to the growth of the state economy narrow borders and caused a general decline of the economic activity by 3.6 percent in the first quarter this decreases primarily to the historical dismantling of the agricultural development about 31.16 percent which kneaded holding back on other economic sectors.
According to one of the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Ger. Mexican advice for lasting agricultural development) published report on the effects of the frost 582,000 hectares were damaged agriculturally of used Ländereien from what 78.03 percent were partially destroyed completely and remaining 21.07 percent. Above all the vegetable cultivation, May cultivation and chickpea cultivation were concerned.
The decline of the economic activity till November has the unemployment in the Mexican state continuously raise. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística Y Geografía observed a quick increase of the unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 inhabitants Sinaloas had no employment what corresponds to 4.53 percent of the acquisition population. In the second quarter rose the unemployment rate on 5.28 percent and from July till September on 6.19 percent what entails 74,000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year decreases to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the faculty for economics and social sciences of the university of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the politics of the public institutions explains indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we observe currently, is an increase of the unemployment which deals with several factors., Among the rest, with liquidity losses at the market as a result of the middle shortenings by the legislation which was dismissed to the fight of the money-laundering in the congress, because for those which accumulate against orders dollar it is not easy to let work this for itself, to invest them or to be of use for, otherwise, something", he explained.
Wanderung gestoppt
López Cervantes pointed out to the fact that a demographic factor is also inherent in the growing unemployment.
"The number of the people who leave the country on search for work abroad, in particular in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and, on the other hand, because it is also difficult there to work to find. These people stay here and look for here job what raises the unemployment", believes he.
Illegal employment
The analysis of the job market in Sinaloa is serious still if one considers the high portion of the illegal employment. This encloses according to INEGI 60.38 percent in the country employees who work without depositing at the cashes of the social security.
To the unemployment and illegal employment the low wages, lowest come in completely Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican social security institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo Y Previsión Social (government authority for work and social care in Mexico).
The average monthly income of the employees in Sinaloa cheat till September 5352 pesos; this is much less than the whole-state average which lies with 7375 pesos.
Decline of the ADI
Beside the dismantling of the economic activity and the growing unemployment the strongest decline of the foreign direct investment (ADI) of the last ten years is registered in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority) amounted to the ADI from January to June, 630 597 dollars what corresponds to a decrease of 87.74 percent in comparison to the 5.143.312 dollars in the same period in the year before.
A whole investment registers for their part the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (government authority for business development) at the rate of 17 280,000 pesos in 2011 which comes before all things of enterprise from the Tertiärsektor.
The debts
In view of the economic crisis the government in July with the national congress applied for a loan at the rate of the 3.000 000 000 pesos which should be invested to the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities. The land congress approved an amount at the rate of 200 600,000 pesos, however, no positive effects of the indebtedness on any of the branches of industry could be ascertained till November in the country.

"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor this year. It must be worked hard to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we must twice exert ourselves. The strains all and in particular the progress of the already well government team joined on each other have not been tuned enough on each other", he explained.
Slow economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, how the frost complicated the economic development of the country to beginning of the year and slowed down.
"The low economic river is the result of several events, among other things of the frost. One of the most important effects is a slowed down economy which is not enough in movement to cause an economic dynamism which could generate a suitable river of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will conclude the year far below our expectations", he believed.
