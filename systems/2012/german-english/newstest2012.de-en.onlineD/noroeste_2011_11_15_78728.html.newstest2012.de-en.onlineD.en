The court approves the crossing on the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion analogous on digital signals belongs during the last years worldwide to the most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) showed the complaints which were lodged by the senate and the chamber of deputies against the presidential decree and by virtue of which the change-over from analogous on digital signals of from 2021 to 2015 must be brought forward, on account of more being absent eight voices which are necessary to the law challenge, back.
A minority of four ministers, under it also the president of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, took the view who has not crossed president Felipe Calderón his competence when he published the law decree with the details about the change-over on the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision the constitutional quarrel brought to life by the senate was rejected, because he did not receive the necessary qualified majority from eight voices, so that the court can decide about the constitutional moderation or the not constitutional moderation. Thus the law remains in strength.
In the project for the complaint which was worked out by minister Olga Sánchez Cordero it was suggested explaining the law decree for unconstitutional, because for them the radio and the television concerning regulations the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (feather ale commission for telecommunications is responsible in Mexico), which is why the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservations.
In favour of the project tuned only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument lodged the senate as well as the representative's chamber constitutional complaint against the law decree. After acceptance of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero did not apply the law decree any more and put all activities to the equipment of the digital transference.
The council of ministers also rejected the complaint lodged by the representative's chamber, without, besides, in the debate on the project for which also the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible to enter.
In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed not to agree with the arguments of the project, namely in the sense that the land government with general regulations may not adjust the measures which the public administration should take.
"I also do not think, that if one did this which would be affected independence of the regulation place". She also reminded of the fact that for the planning of strategical politics areas, as for example of the sector of the telecommunications, for constitutional-juridical reasons the central-state government is responsible, because this leads the state problems.
The substitute of the analogous signals by digital ones is one of the most important changes which has taken place during the last years in the whole world, and she causes a better use of the radioelectric spectrum, a raised quality of the signal and more canals.
Pushing out the conversion, she believed, is pushing open the usufruct of the digitization what is a decision in the public interest which has not only technical points of view, "then she encloses economic, social, political and security-technical aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the whole system, according to the principle of the economic management through the state they contained a group of signs which lays the constitution in the hands of the central-state government."
She called in the memory that many countries had already carried out worldwide the digital conversion, namely about the government, although they disposed of high specified facilities.
One cannot conclude that the government intervenes with the publication of the contested law decree in the competence of the congress, because the laws adopted by the legislative powers would be kept", she assured.
