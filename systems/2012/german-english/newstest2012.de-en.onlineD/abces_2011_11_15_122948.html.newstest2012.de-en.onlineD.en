Japan reincarnates after the earthquake
The GDP grows about 1.5% thanks to the domestic consumption and finishes the spiral of the free fall from the beginning of March
Since the last March the Japanese economy was paralyzed which is to itself still in the recovery after the destructive earthquake which flowed into a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster, Japan to the 2nd world war had experienced.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo valued the damages to property at 300,000 dollars, a blow which seems to weaken in spite of the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of durable case the information served for the gross domestic product from July to September to conclude, finally, this chapter: the GDP grew about 1.5% in comparison to the previous quarter and about 6% to the rate projected for the year.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan begins the business year in March, 2012 - moreover, the quickest growth means since the period March, 2010.
The reimpetus can be partially explained by the machine sales for the new construction from the earthquake and the following Tsunami to laid waste areas.
Really the enterprises raised her investments by 1.1% in comparison to the decline by 0.9% for the investments which were registered from January to March the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the actual change of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively from keynsianischen impulses which use the crisis to build up infrastructures or to build anew.
There has woken Japan in particular thanks to the development of the domestic consumption which puts out currently 60% of the Japanese GDP.
This variable rose by 1%, pushed from the growing issues for vehicles, trips and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has confided in the home market, after the yen - the Japanese currency - to itself in one of the "shelter currencies" of the investors who flee before the debt crisis of the eurozone and the murky forecasts for the USA, a privilege which presses like a gravestone on the accounts of the export enterprises.
By a harder currency the products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the big technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led back her weak commercial results from July till September on the quotation of the yen.
While the markets also besieges furthermore the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda remains watchful.
"One must pay attention to the persistent risks, yesterday, for example, on the deterioration some foreign Ã–konomien, the effects of the floods in Thailand and the quick revaluation of the yen", meant the Assistant Secretary for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are not really very cheering up.
The organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD) explained that most member states had shown clearer signs for a slowing down of the economic development in September.
The indicator which preexcludes the turning points of the world economy brought to light that with the biggest economic abilities the brake would have moved.
Since he sank by four tenths up to off 100.4 points in comparison to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone lies even below this average value which lies with 100, after she has sunk by eight tenths on 99.13 points.
