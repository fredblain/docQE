From Christian Teevs
Does the German bank give up her business with agrarian raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information Josef Ackermann has asked a working group to check the results of the speculation for the arms of the world.
Then in January the group boss wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the German citizens the thing is clear: 84 percent of the Germans find according to a study not satisfactory that banks with agrarian raw materials speculate like wheat or maize.
Two thirds of the interviewees demand even that the German bank and other loan institutes get out of this business because it aggravates the problems of the poorest of the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey by order of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, the Foodwatch at the middle of October presented.
In it the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets force up the prices on the global raw material stock exchanges - and, therefore, the banks carry a partial responsibility in the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer custodians is directed specifically against German's bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks operate like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley alike.
Originally raw material bets were intended to secure trader against price fluctuations.
However, meanwhile agree most experts that the Zocker have decoupled themselves from offer and inquiry - and make at the expenses of the poorest profits.
Differently than the US competitors Ackermann reacted to the criticism: He promised to check the reproaches and said, no business is worth it "to risk the good call of the German bank".
According to the information of from SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group checks currently the reproaches from the Foodwatch report.
Till the end of the year the check should be concluded, then the results are presented to the board of directors of the German bank - with recommendation, as should become with it handled.
Then at the end of January the point of the bank wants to inform which conclusions it draws.
At the end a reduction of the raw material business could stand, or even the complete turning away.
Ackermann does handicraft in his image
Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, however, confirmed at the same time his criticism of the finance branch: "The bets on rising prices of food show especially drastically how thoughtlessly banks damage today the public welfare."
Ackermann stands as the uppermost bank lobbyist now particularly in the duty.
"The German bank must stroke all arrangements from her port folio by which money is used for bets on food prices", said Bode.
"All the same whether it is for Mr. Ackermann about hunger suffering people or about the call of the German bank."
The examination of Ackermann comes at first sight unexpectedly, however, is clearly that the group boss would like to deliver a perfect picture few months before his departure from the office.
On Monday the German bank announced that the chief executive officer does not change differently than planned in the supervisory board.
With a turning away from the argumentative agrarian speculation he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to care about possible losses - his successor would deal, finally, with it.
Every second would discontinue raw material arrangements
Foodwatch bem√ºht sich, Bastelraum Druck auf Bastelraum-Betriebsleiter hoch zu halten.
Up to now have already taken part more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey for which the institute of Forsa has questioned on the 7th and 8th of November 1001 people.
Just eleven percent hold it, therefore, for legitimate that offers the German bank arrangements with which is bet on prices of food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions if they find out that her bank takes part in such shops: Every second would discontinue according to the survey all arrangements by which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would advise friend against such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think, to discontinue her account and to change to another institute.
