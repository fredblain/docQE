Troops feel rather compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala dress which collected millions of dollar of homeless ex-servicemen in New York city.
Kid rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a headword hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine gathered round him.
The amount in black dinner jackets got up and applauded.
"The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman who organised the donation action in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the gala dress who was observed, among the rest, by the stick boss and chairpersons at that time, admiral Mike to garden peats saw the role of the troops different.
"You were introduced like orphan's children", wrote the officer in e-mail.
I am sure, the organizers have it well-intentioned.
I know this.
But it was no respect, really not. It was a compassion.
The crass contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy respect between the military and the mostly reserved, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for her victims.
But the praise has his price, say official member.
The public behaves increasingly in such a way as if she was sorry the people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims", said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently is the only way of the support that is to press us in the role of unhappy souls."
The subject is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear thanklessly or in the quarrel with the public which they serve.
Also they have recognised that the fury, the returning troops confronted during the last years of the Vietnam war, was by far worse.
As a result talks about compassion take place secretly and private between war ex-servicemen.
After his both sons from fights with the marine have returned, warned of the Colonel a. D. Mark Cancian them before the fact that people could see her service from two different perspectives beyond the military world.
Some would look at them with a feeling of reverence, because it defeats rebels and to exotic places had travelled.
Other would ask themselves whether a "furious, violent ex-serviceman is hidden under the surface", said Cancian which had fought in Iraq and has taken over after his return a high state post in Washington.
During his working search, so he said, he felt that some of the Befrager asked subtly whether he is able to stand firm immediately after his return from the fight to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you speak of your service, you must hold the negative impressions against it", explained Cancian to his sons.
The missing ease of the military is rooted partly in the missing interest of the Americans in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield become from a country that little experience with the military has and sees only little use during the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, picked out only seldom as a praise.
"We as a nation do not estimate military heroism any more in such a way as it was still absolutely usual during the Second World War", said second lieutenant general David Barno a. D. which commanded US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead of this the praise of the politicians and the public concentrates mainly upon the grief of an official member.
Troops find recognition for the number of the attacks which they have endured, have lost the number of the friends, which them or for the gravity of her injuries.
