Darina Rychtářová about her disloyal husband:
You can keep Iveta - this donkey to you, I do not want him any more!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is end!
After her spouse Josef Rychtá ř (53) of the protector of Iveta Barto š ová (45) had become their lover, Darina still remained hope that Josef awakes from his rose dream and comes home.
But finally now it is over with the patience and for the other life it has put to herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner", explained D. Rychtářová.
As a Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Barto š ová in her own house Shelter had offered, would not probably have occurred to her sometimes in the dream how with her man goes out.
When Iveta on her urging moved after 30 days again from and back after Říčany, Josef immediately went along.
Yes he confessed even publicly that he loves them.
With the time resigned Darina, it seemed even, as if it wants to be reconciled with her disloyal man again - now finally, however, she jilted him.
Rychytá ř makes no difference it with whom his woman sleeps
If, nevertheless, Rychtá ř Iveta Barto š ová should leave in future, he will not conceive at home certainly to open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days at our common home, I will not chase out him."
"However, not as beloved, lost old donkey, but as the person to whom I still have certain connections" betrayed Mrs. Rychtářová; however, she also said, she has separated from him already emotionally and exists only on mutual Anständigkeit.
Josef carries the fact that to him Darina has bolted the back door up to now with dignity.
"I respect the decision of my woman."
"I stay together with Iveta, in it nothing changes."
"My woman wants a paper marriage and I respect this."
"The company goes on, I look after the repair, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, we divide only the bed just not", said J. Rychtá ř (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to search itself new love, he does not want to hinder them in it.
"We do not sleep with each other, so makes no difference to me whether she has a friend or who is this.
To me it is clear that this is my guilt, I have fallen in love with Iveta and, therefore, I take over any responsibility.
