Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws when court accepts case
On the day in which the Supreme Court gathers behind close doors to discuss the politically sharing question whether one listens to a challenge of the health laws of president Obama two his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas took part, in a dinner which became from the office gesponsort that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place the last Thursday when all nine judges met for a discussion to consult on the petitions to the check.
One of the too treated cases was a complaint which 26 states have lodged against the far-reaching reform of the health service which the last year were decided by the congress, a law which became with the conservative activists everywhere in the USA the catchword.
The judges agreed to the hearing. Really a 5 1/2 hourly basis discussion is expected in March, presumably their result will presumably start the presidency fight in 2012 which will be at the time in which the judicial ruling is announced in the full way.
The lawyer who will stand in court and state that the law is to be tilted will presumably be Paul Clement, once Chief State Prosecutor under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements office, Bancroft PLLC, one was the nearly two dozen enterprises which the annual dinner of the federalistic society supported, an old-established group which devotes itself to the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another enterprise, which the dinner sponsorte, Jones Day, represented one of the trade associations, which Nationwide Federation of Independently business which contest the law.
Another sponsor was of the Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc which is terrifically involved financially in the result of the process.
The dinner took place few hours, after the court had consulted on the case, at a Washington hotel.
Among the rest, service had Mitch McConnell, the leader of faction of the Republicans in the senate and an explained opponent of the health reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: Both judges visit for many years events of the federalistic society.
And this does not offend against moral rules.
Indeed, to itself the judge of the code of conduct relieved who regulates the actions of the low Federal High Court judges.
If they were it, they would probably fall under principle the 4C of the code which means the following: "A judge can take part in benefit performance events of law of close and other organisations and the judge may be no speaker, guest of honour or according to programme no guest of such events."
Were nevertheless sufficient the extreme nearness of Scalia and Thomas to two with the case in connection for standing offices as well as to an enterprise with a massive financial interest in this to alarm government activists morality-and.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court keeps to the same rules which are valid for all the other Federal High Court judges", said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the USA.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with floating procedures in the court."
Their appearance and her support of a donation action for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not satisfactory.
Scalia and Thomas show little thoughtfulness for critics who say, they would mix court matter too easily with groups which are guided towards the agenda as for example of the federalistic society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a known conservative activist.
Against it the conservatives state that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a Chief State Prosecutor under the Obama's government when the first law challenges came at first instance in court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of prepossession, because it would be engaged too much in the defence of the law to be unpredjudiced.
Kagan makes no arrangements to do this.
