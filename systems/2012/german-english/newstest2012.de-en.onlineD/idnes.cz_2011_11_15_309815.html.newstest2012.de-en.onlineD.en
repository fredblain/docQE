Profis behaupten - ein Stilist-Durcheinander auch ein guter Psychologe sein
In the prefatory article about as stylists learn, I had grumbled a little bit that this was a little too much materials for the beginning.
There I did not anticipate in the least what still comes.
Talks of three professionals from the branch, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar through how "on the place" runs.
It should come even more badly.
The closer the check moves, more information and practical duties approaches us.
But even if the course everybody takes place on Saturdays and on Sundays, he is still completely booked.
This time we debated with manager Alena (in the course not a single one man takes part) as one draws a woman who has no ideally proportionierte figure.
And this are, at least, most from us.
One have a too short neck, they change a too boyish figure without well-arranged curves and again other are plump.
It is a thing of the stylist to conceal optically wide shoulders, to extend the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips as one draws a women's type like Jennifer Lopez - with big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - nicely and figure-emphatically, without she looks much too provocative.
If, for example, the difference is so big between waist and hips that the rock or the trousers really does not fit, one should allow to tailor at least one piece to measure.
One will not regret this certainly, because well seated clothes are simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock one feels much better because than in one stands off from the pole which all the time high and slips in the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can allow themselves again to carry clothing with folds, billowing, applications, embroideries or Raffung.
With this amount of information and figure type I am glad that I have time a whole week to let go everything thoroughly by the head.
And, nevertheless, I have fear that it is not almost to be created in view of the applied homework.
Each of the course participants got because a VIP assigned for whom she should devise suitable outfits - day clothing and evening evening gown.
Besides, we should consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the suitable star and his figure type.
I should "draw" Miranda Kerr whom you possibly know from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Inside I rejoice, because this is much better for me personally, than to draw, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera who has increased in the last time probably in hundred kilos (well, this is exaggerated a little bit), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the clothes of magazines or look on the Internet, print out and afterwards graphically work on.
Then in the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, ours should be expressed quite personal style and our respect with the graphic creation.
It is because very important to think also about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist draws the models because not only purely physically, but also forms the so-called product side in the journal (after concrete default, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told to us about it.
But only on Sunday.
That is the fact that a stylist must have a good total view.
With information about figure type filled Saturday talk was immediately spiced by three visitors from the branch:
from the stylist Jan Pokorn ý, from the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and from the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us of the fact that fashion is an illusion and which should be able a stylist to use this.
And sent in stylist is able to work with one single clothing piece in quite different manner.
The magic word is called variability.
Thus one can carry, for example, a trench coat as usual about the jeans, so like a T-shirt or coat, one can carry him, however, also on the naked body, draw sales shoes in addition and carry him as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collars and immediately the whole look looks completely different.
"Plays with it", he stressed.
However, mostly the following advice suited me: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Only then you may injure them", said Jakub.
Finally, becomes clear to me, why we must swot up all these doctrines what one can combine with what and why, even if one gets to see often completely other in fashion magazines.
To be quiet completely from fashion looking.
Now thanks to the photographer Ben I know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variations than he takes photos at last.
So one must be prepared for a Fashion story with ten sides (speak ten outfits) of styling at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing on the photo looks completely different, than in reality in combination with other accessories every now and then.
One must count on all with the creation of the outfit.
The fact that image and Styling put out every now and then half of the success, this also confirmed to us Jan Pokorn ý.
There one needs to himself just Madonna to look at a not quite excellent singer from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In Czechia one faces to the services of a stylist rather aloofly.
Also known personalities hold this often for Rau-thrown money (which is a central issue that I bring something like I to it look is second-rate).
And if already somebody can be styled by us, we should calculate on the fact that he or they forces upon us in all probability quite an other (smaller) size than he or they needs in reality.
Then afterwards one needs only to googlen to find out with certainty that the gutter press writes, the suitable VIP is closed again or taken, etc.
Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday to the heart not to think that himself a stylist needs to focus only on the fashion and then "to assemble" the outfit.
At his work he must communicate above all with the people whom he styles and he must be a clever psychologist.
People estimate without toadying and stand to his opinion.
"If any manager orders us to sight her wardrobe and to complement pretty pieces, then we cannot clear to her the whole cupboard and say - my God, this is awful."
"One must find at least a few commendable things to which one recommends what one can carry in addition", says Mario.
He showed us also quite specifically what must contain thus a so-called "place pocket".
So such a pocket which one buttons up in the waist and in which one carries all necessary Proprietäten on himself.
Except such to clear things, like scissors, roller for the hair removing or safety pins she also contains such utensils like a nylon thread (with it the stylist helps himself while taking a photo of products like handbags or hats from), special clips with which behind the clothes are heaped if she is too big (pins or other clips are prohibited, so that the material does not break) and of course Nähzeug.
So that we not only must listen, but also can try out a little bit practically, we learnt how one untersticks shoes properly.
Also while taking a photo in the studio where the floor is level one can damage the shoe sole, never mind him outdoors.
We stuck ourselves o and stuck...
With the scissors one may not even touch the shoes, so that one does not damage them.
So one must go forward really cleverly.
Mario pleased me, while he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is same not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of that what we got to hear with in the second weekend continuation course.
One has become clear to me, in the meantime - to devote itself to the styling at professional level, is no child's play.
