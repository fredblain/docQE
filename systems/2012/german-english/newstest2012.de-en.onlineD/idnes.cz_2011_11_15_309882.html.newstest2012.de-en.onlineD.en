V Need for speed: "The of run" - the unlawful running straight through America
Review
The originally carefree journey becomes an absolutely avoidable, dilettantish mistake the routine journey to the early shift by a series.
Though one succeeded in fulfilling largely the ambitions, but what this already uses if obviously nobody felt like acting a little bit more.
Already before he came on the counters, the new part with the subtitle woke up "The of run" high expectations.
If he promised, nevertheless to shift the quite elderly play series "Need for speed" again a piece in a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he seemed to be really not only one of many action-racing plays.
We were also curious as the fitted passages precipitate in which the main protagonist from the car rises and goes on on foot.
But as one is already accustomed with NFS, a lot is different in the final effect than one had expected.
Certainly - potentially these are rather decent arcade runnings, but all together the play is curtailed by some superfluous mistakes which are present in this series more or less already during a few years.
So these are, actually, no more mistakes, but rather signs of an in principle incomprehensible laziness of the play developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First one is introduced in the history whose central figure Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an unlawful race straight through America.
In San Francisco, so on the west coast, one sits down to the steering wheel - with the job to be as first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The whole route is split in ten stages and in more than fifty single runnings.
This means that every running on other distance is delivered and that the single stages take place in different, enough different and interesting environment.
One has no moment the impression that play would offer the same over and over again.
Some surroundings are to be looked in addition still really nicely, although the technical level of the graphics does not go out about of the former parts of the series.
So nothing earthshattering.
But the journey by the desert, by autumnal scenery or high on top by deeply snow-covered scenery look visually very pleasant.
Every now and then atypical elements bring a little change in the single runnings.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a wild tower which limits the view strongly.
In the mountains again one must pay attention like hell that one is not buried by an avalanche.
Besides, the single runnings are inserted rather well one after the other.
Though only some, but they reach.
For a while one tries in such a way to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle, a classical running), then one has to make up for time (then classical running against the stopwatch), expects still a personal duel with one single opponent.
And in addition the police which wants to mess up the whole thing to one still interferes.
A novelty are the passages in which Jack leaves the carriage.
Besides, it is rather about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees before somebody and where the player must help him, while he presses the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complex.
However, it surprises that there is in the play much less of such passages than one would expect (specifically probably only three).
At last this is to the thing rather to the advantage, because thus this element has at least no chance to become dull - it belongs in the context to above-said to the elements which make the play more diverse.
The driving model walks in the footprint of the preceding parts.
Though seen that is from today's point of view, it tears out no trees, on the other hand, one could not state, it would be bad.
Who searches realistic simulations, must look around somewhere else.
But the local driving model does justice to an action-loaded racing driving also furthermore quite well, although one could find better ones with the competition.
Till then everything is so far in the best order.
Real problems appear only after certain time.
In contrast to the driving model the collision model is not completely O.K.
From a play of this kind is hardly to be expected that it calculates complicated deformations and collisions, but if one has notion practically before no impact on any object as the car behaves, then everything is not obviously in order.
Typical example: With the narrow overhauling or driving past oncoming cars one "touches" at some places the other carriage only easily, one comes to other, nearly identical situation, however, in the skidding and turns wild pirouettes.
Or if the cart immediately goes to scrap metal.
Thanks to the rest kind system puts out though nothing else, from annoyingly it is always.
The Restarts are solved thus: if one has total loss or far lands off the distance, the play throws back to the last clue of the distance.
Only - in every running one has only five Restarts.
If one has exhausted them, from the front everything goes off.
The Restarts are rather a sort of an aid, for the case that a little bit does not succeed, but on it one should not rather count.
However, sometimes does not help sometimes the rest kind, there nothing else helps, than to learn the critical segment from the head.
Really it is disagreeable that the same things often happen at the same places.
One must wear out some curves, for example, in quite specific way, otherwise one simply does not fit by.
Somewhere else one meets at the suitable place "civil" cars always in the same configuration, all the same whether one comes as first or fifth, five seconds earlier or one minute later.
This is irritating particularly in situations if one sees that the opponent goes past before playing to two oncoming cars, but until one himself comes there, the carriages are already in such a position that one must drive round them or brake.
And it makes no difference, when one comes there, everything is so conceived because that it comes to this situation always close before your nose.
The opponents have even other advantages.
In the whole play there are a few places where one is always overtaken at the same place by the same opponent and also here again without taking into consideration the time.
This is most mad for the end of the play on the long bridge which one passes in counterdirection.
The opponent must overtake here obviously like crazy.
And if he is then already before one, he takes of course the view, so that one drives there in the beginning an own car a few times in Klump.
Clear - one wants to make the play simply exciting and more thrilling, however, this intention is so clear that she spoils fast the joy in the play.
And this is a pity, because is rather entertaining in spite of an easier driving model the play all together and here and there also in such a way action-loaded that one does not know almost any more where the head stands to one.
And, in principle, makes no difference what is "responsible" in it - the draught with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the runnings in a manner that no boredom can arise, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the carriage change in the course of the runnings.
Besides, one may not overlook the filling stations in the distance, because exactly here one can change the car, although in most cases the car is sufficient which one just has.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports-cars are well suitable for the urban areas, the strong American saloons for the straight highways and exotic super-sports-cars for the technical journeys, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the play history the mode of the problems (challenges) - the runnings also goes in the single places which one knows from the history.
Here there are not only medallions but also to win points of experience for own profile which is together for the duties (challenges) and the history.
To reach to the higher driver's level, different objects must be unlocked: started from the car, up to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time with the on-line function autolog which compares, among the rest, own achieved results to their other player and also provides for other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible boobs is a situation in the last running of the history.
Here one comes because by the car to an underground tunnel (because of me) where one races in the darkness on the rails long (because of me).
On the speedometer figures look between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but there comes all at once from the back an underground and goes uncompromisingly to scrap metal.
In our editorial staff we will still probably argue long about whether a blackout was the play creator or whether to us the authors hold for so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overpowering, however, at least the visual overall impression is rather attractive in most cases and is even excellent here and there.
It is the more irritating that to itself with some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz become slower and this every now and then quite dramatically.
Nevertheless, this concerns in particular the accidents with bigger number of involving where nothing is useful to one a continuous FPS anyway.
The sound reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a taste thing.
To respond in the endeavours, an as wide as only possible scale of rather young audience, did a soundtrack a l√° "from everybody originate a little bit" - but who buys to himself such a play already because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for speed: The run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the play was not curtailed by the mentioned absolutely unnecessary mistakes, we could have stated with the chest note of the conviction that The run is the best piece of NFS during the last years.
But thus the play looks anyhow incomplete.
In for himself a first-class pleasure, but one should be prepared for the fact that to one these mistakes with the power of airport floodlights sting in the eyes.
