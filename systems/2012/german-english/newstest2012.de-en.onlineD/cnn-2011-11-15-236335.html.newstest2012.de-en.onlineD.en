The developing bank of Asia (Asian Development bank, ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in his heavy debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend which will brake the growth of the economy of Asia.
Rajat Gnawing, administrative manager of the ADB with headquarter in Manila, said that both fastest growing economic nations of the world must do "everything in your power standing" to accelerate the rest of the currency block either by the international currency ground or by direct mutual arrangements.
He warned about the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) which look "without passion" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European guidance and the European resources helps to prevent a long-term breakdown of the global economy through Asia.
"We sit everybody in the same boat."
"Everybody is helpful which can help Europe from this crisis", he said the Financial Times during an interview on the edge of the world economy forum in Mumbai.

"If China and India can help, then with all means."
Monetary union of Europe got during the past months in a heavy debt crisis.
During the past days interest costs of Italy rose dangerously and the prime ministers from Italy as well as from Greece have withdrawn.
The upcoming heavy debt crisis in Europe pokes fears that the global economy could fall in the recession and led to calls, the leading threshold countries would have to get together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag forecast that every support of Asia is canalised by the IWF, however, said that mutual arrangements - as for example the purchase of Bonds of the EU-rescue fund, the European finance stabilisation facility (EFSF) - to the European partners offers bigger negotiations power in Asia.

"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 go to pension and spend holidays on the beach. Then one has a problem", he said.
Lee Howell, administrative manager of the world economy forum, asked alike, why reserves of India should be used to keep the numerous and well paid-up employees in the civil service in Greece, with jobs escorted in badly, losses to introducing facilities as for example of the railway.
Mr. Nag said that the crises have in the eurozone "significant domino effects" on completely Asia.
"Now the risk of the gradation" threatens the forecast of the ADB with an economic growth about 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 / on account of the menacing danger from Europe.
He said, vulnerable threshold markets would have to provide "contingency plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital outflow of her Wortschaften.
