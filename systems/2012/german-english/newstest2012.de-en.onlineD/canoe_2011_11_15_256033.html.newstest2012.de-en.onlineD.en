Russian scientist helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, Wjatscheslaw Danilenko, has helped Iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specified on nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The institute of science and international security ISIS bases the result on the recently appeared report of the international agency for nuclear security to AIEA as well as other documents going out from this UN agency to the inquiry of this scientist.
The last week her "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme had informed of the AIEA.
According to detailed study of the AIEA documents on the part of ISIS the Danilenko born in 1934 had apparently worked since beginning of the 60s more than three decades in a Soviet military nuclear centre in Tscheljabinsk (Urals) and was involved in the production generated by explosion of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991 he should have left the centre to found an enterprise in Kiev, the "Nano diamond" produces.
The economic difficulties of his enterprise would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranian message in the Ukraine.
Before his return to Russia he has helped then from 1996 to 2002 in an Iranian programme.
In her last report mentioned the AIEA "strong tips to the fact that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system "has been supported by the work of a foreign expert who has worked not only in this technology äuβerst wandered seie, but, in addition, as a state member of the agency informed, his whole professional career about essentially on this technology immediately in the military nuclear energy programme of his country of origin."
