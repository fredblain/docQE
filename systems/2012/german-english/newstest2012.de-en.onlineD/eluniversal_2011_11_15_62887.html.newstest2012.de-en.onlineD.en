MSS announces a research protocol for discovering of the gene for obesity
She social security institution of Mexico leads a research project for discovering of the gene for obesity with children and youngsters which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (social security institution of Mexico) announced that it leads a research project for the discovery of the gene for obesity with children and youngsters under the title "Genetics of the obesity in childhood and youth" with which the genetic markers should be found in connection with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, leader of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, main focus Biochemistry) in the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers was built up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postal postgraduate's course of studies in the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and in the Centro de Investigación Y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico where every Saturday from 8.00 o'clock tests with children and youngsters are carried out.
He stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the federal state of México) began and is continued since the 8th of October on the sports field by Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the federal state of México).
If the aim is achieved by from 500 to 600 investigation people, the study on the sports field is continued by Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and is concluded on by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained, the aim of the study is getting to know the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youngsters to the prevention more chronically of degenerative illnesses.
On the occasion of the worldwide day the diabetes he explained, it is aimed that 3000 children and youngsters should fill food-related questionnaires at the age of from six to 14 years by the consent and under supervision of her parents.
Questions about her physical activity and her informal illness prehistory are also put to you to control the risk factors which could entail diabetes or Niereninsuffizienz.
He explained desweiteren that on called Saturdays the investigation people were controlled measured (weight, size, waist extent), her blood pressure and blood values would be determined like the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of the identification by genes in connection with obesity in the infancy).
Cruz López stressed, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health staff about the alarming increase in weight of young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 proved that in just six years the portion of fat boys has increased about 77 percent and which of the girls with obesity about 47 percent. Also the fatness has dramatically risen", stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
He bragged, the search for genetic markers would be founded because the genetic history of the population of Mexico would differ from the other people.
He gave that (e) Mexican is European and to 5 percent of African descent (in) on average to 65 percent more Indian-in American manner, to 30 percent what to themselves are connected in the genes, with diabetes and overweight, reflects.
Quite in general he explained, the genetics of the obesity expresses itself in the inability to burn the profit of the energy taken to us (calories), so that this is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained, the direct use for the investigation participants would exist in a comprehensive investigation of the children with which would be found out whether showed this 1 degree of fatness or obesity.
Even the occurence of the dark skin folds would be examined in the nape and in the inside arm (Akanthosis) which point to the likelyhood of metabolism disturbances and diabetes in the prestage.
All information would be treated confidentially and informed of the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all measuring results to the parents and suggest to them changes of the life style which are measured for the prevention by illnesses.
Cruz López explained, there would be three basic factors which are responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic illnesses: Lack of exercise, that is missing movement in the everyday life to spend most time of the day before the television and to use means of transportation, to walk instead of short ways.
The high calorie admission, that is a raised consumption of sugared drinks and coal hydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger etc.) together with a high fat admission and egg white admission as well as the genetics which should be analysed in this research project.
