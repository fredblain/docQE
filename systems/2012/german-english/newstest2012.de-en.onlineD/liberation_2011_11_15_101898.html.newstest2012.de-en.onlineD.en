Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If exists a subject that may not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is absolutely the energy policy.
Availability and costs of the electricity influence the buying power as well as the competition ability of the enterprises in direct Maβe.
It is reasonable to take an electoral meeting to the occasion to think about this subject as well as about the position of the nuclear energy.
The debate will yield only fruit if it sounds out the totality of economic, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options.
The French should back up her opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 milliard people are on this planet, the demographic evolution speeds up a duplication of the electric inquiry up to 2050, should not have to renounce a huge portion of the world population a vital element.
At the same time one must reduce the shortage of the fossil resources to be able to produce electricity furthermore continuously without forgetting the compelling need for the reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions, a subject disappeared from the ecological debate, to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The accident of Fukushima changes none of these parametres.
Hence, blebt Germany furthermore in his decision isolated to renounce nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium which subjects his decision of the need to find a spare spring capable of substitution, nor in Switzerland which intends just to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil to call only some states her projects pursue against it furthermore with determination.
The United States have decided for their part to Fukushima to attach an other unity to her park, while they start running the work Three Mile closed after the nuclear accident Iceland once more.
Even if the German model straightened on renewable energy sources is put now and then as a model, nevertheless, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a rise in price of the electric price, one by the increased resort on import gas reinforced energetic dependence in particular from Russia, an increase by gas power stations and coal-fired power stations of caused CO2 issues.
The totality of these joyless effects will already become apparent within less months.
The case Denmark gives occasion for the reflexion.
Denmark is on the one hand European league leaders concerning wind energy from which it covers 30% of his electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately uses with wind energy; aufgrunddessen his CO2 outputs as well as his electric price are in each case about 65% and 50% higher than the suitable European average value.
Thanks to the permanence of our energy policy our neighbours pay an electric calculation 40% higher in contrast to our French households.
Because the energy price shows a key role of the competition ability as well as a stability security of the industry on national ground in the globalized economy, the französichen enterprises on account of the most favorable electricity in Europe have an advantage.
Hence, every significant reduction with regard to the nuclear energy would cause a strong taking of the energy price what would make the noble statements about the Reindustrialisierung of our country and the defence of the buying power the illusion.
Surveys proved that it is a price to which the groβe majority of the French is ready to pay just as little as she reveals opposition against the principle of this energy source.
If we visualise that the energy policy of our country has enabled to build up an industrial branch with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
On account of her strong export character she brings a vast amount of specified smaller and small and medium-sized companies on the international markets and makes these jobs countless to creators.
Should France make the decision to get out of the nuclear power, a Groβteil this KMU would fall victim, and the annual 6 milliard euros in capital goods and nuclear energy export would shrivel more and more.
Which electrician would instruct one to the functioning for sixty years of conceived EPR if the decline of his producer is preprogrammed?
To solve the energetic equation one must put away that there is a wonder drug to the production of electricity just as little like a devil's work.
The solutions developed by the company Areva Poor in CO2, for the application of nuclear power and renewable energy testify from the complementary of the energy sources.
The highest possible safety standards are to be maintained for the nuclear power an absolute imperative.
In France we have a security service which carries out uncompromising and clear controls in already existing works as for example in the construction in Flamanville.
Their working teams which have made a name to themselves on account of her professionalism are just too owned by the security image.
Within 50 years the core industry has experienced three serious sturgeon cases.
Only just one, namely in Three Mile Iceland, has entered under normal operating conditions; thus he ran without consequences for person and environment.
In Chernobyl the drama became by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure bring on.
With Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident was never caused by two natural disasters of been there magnitude which caused the death of several ten thousand people.
The core industry will pull her apprenticeships also from this accident as it had done this after both preceding ones.
As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation of the security services of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, shows of the EPR a draught which allows robustness compared with such phenomena to him.
Because it is judged among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a building freeze in Flamanville would be a splendid present to the competition of Areva and EDF, while one would leave them free road to tear the leadership position in the unavoidable nuclear power development in himself.
It is unavoidable and legitimate to look for the best Energiebouquet for our country, however, it would be irresponsible to let dominate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate which determines as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
