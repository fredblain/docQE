The north Stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas long-distance line the north Stream which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia was put in company.
She should deliver gas for a recompense of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to commit this event with shine and Gloria.
More than 500 loaded guests, under it four heads of state and heads of government, have been present the last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestra acoustic irradiation and by gourmet's refreshment bar of the inauguration of the new gas long-distance line the north Stream which connects Russia and Germany under the sea level directly with each other.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister Françoi Fillon as well as his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have turned symbolic-wise together the controls of the valve which carry the Russian gas in the west-European net.
With the new gas long-distance line 27.5 milliard cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year should be delivered by the first conduit of 1.224-km length which connects the region Saint Petersburg with Mecklenburg-West Pomerania to Western Europe.
The second conduit which permits a whole delivery of 55 milliard cubic metres of gas - to the recompense of the French whole consumption - should be finished in the end of 2012.
And one already lets the eventuality of the construction of the third management on the same distance be reminiscent.
For Gazprom the timely and point-exact completion of this huge building works like a victory.
The project was very argumentative in Poland and the Baltic states.
The north Stream pipeline will allow because a direct gas delivery to Germany, namely under avoidance any route course by third countries (Poland or the Ukraine) on the country road.
For this reason these both countries lose a little of her power: Now for them it becomes more difficult to exert pressure on Russia, while they threaten to close the admission to west-European markets.
Warsaw, strongest in the debate engaged, had not shied away to compare the north Stream pipeline to "new German sowietischen pact" in binding to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is sensitive politically seen äuβerst.
Western Europe has won by the support of this Russian project an even higher security of supply.
This energy nevertheless European at the expenses of a weakening, because the project has hit a breach between West European and Eastern European.
Russia has finished it in hardly five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries which show strong gas consumption and whose gas occurence goes to the bending of putting through.
"This gas long-distance line is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery which connects us in organic way", confirmed François Fillon by the inauguration of the gas long-distance line, while he pointed to it in which degree the groβen gas contracts are also important from political and true side.
All this explains the wide smile of the Gazprom managers numerously represented in Lubmin concerning the gas inlet.
The construction of this gas long-distance line is also a prominent technology.
The unterwater pipe exists of steel with concrete sheath which it should protect against ship anchoring.
She rests on the seabed, in about 200-m depth.
By her construction had to become from the Second World War to dating mine fields made way.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed as a precaution or be destroyed", bragged Jens Müller, speaker of the society the north Stream.
Auβerdem had to be seized reinforced Maβnahmen for the protection of the fauna and flora.
The management is a long queue from metal, difficult like 242 Eiffeltürme who is interrupted about the whole length by nothing: neither by valves, nor servicing stations.
A controlling platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, however, the project persons responsible have refrained from it, because the Swedes were keen a little to see settling a Russian state society in permanent way on height of her coasts.
"In case of an average we close the gas passage at less than one minute", specified Jens Müller.
In case of a leakage the gas itself located in the gas long-distance line escapes in the air.
This case is probably looked by the designers, nevertheless, as only a little, because the Schweiβnähte were estimated at a permanence of a leakage per 100,000 years.
The state supervision of the gas long-distance line is guaranteed by an underwater robot which is steered for external observation purposes from a sea ship, as well as from a device which circulates inside of the gas long-distance line.
It owns the form of a cigar, miβt 1 metre of diameter, is introduced in the inside of the conduit and is moved by the gas pressure.
After three entire days of the locomotion by the management with a speed of 3 metres per second, the device with his arrival delivers the most exact information about possible deformations of the metal.
The gas long-distance line was conceived to function during fifty years without having to be submitted even to the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is quite simply guaranteed by pressure.
This amounts to 200 cash in the admission, 100 cash in the discharge position.
Five societies have united for the realisation of this project her forces.
Nevertheless, the management guidance remains in the hand of Gazprom which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore are here the German societies of E. ON and BASF attached (to 15.5%), just as the Dutch gas-university and the French company group GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five societies have formed an enterprise community which is called the north Stream and is instructed with the construction as well as company of the gas long-distance line.
She has her seat in train in Switzerland where the taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom has rented then of this society the whole capacity of her gas transport, namely on extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the whole capacity, all the same as gro β it transports honestly gas amount precipitates", specified Jens Müller.
The financing of the gas distant line construction was secured to 30% by stockholders as well as to 70% by bank loan.
The whole labour cost should amount to 7.4 milliard euros for both conduits.
For GDF Suez the investment sum amounted, for example, to 240 millions.
Nevertheless, the minority stockholders are gewi β to bring again her displays, because Gazprom carries only the liabilty risk.
The gas long-distance line kicks in a sandy, with pines wooded coastal line with Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-metre-high valves form the gas escape gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identification numbers of the arriving gas, before this is passed on in the German gas long-distance lines.
Since the last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with million cubic metres of Russian gas per passing by hour.
With full capacity there would be this 3 million cubic metres per hour as well as 6 millions in 2012.
