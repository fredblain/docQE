Debts for construction works
In the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 to intended social constructions for migrants run the risk not to be finished because of missing means or only with big delay, meant Miguel Á ngel López Miranda.
The leader of the municipal authority for social development explained that, although the schedules of work are already progressed, they float now in danger, because the state government has not paid the means being entitled to her which cross millions pesos for three programmes 11.
He said, the whole investment in these three programmes amounts to nearly 50 million pesos from which 25 percent fell on the state. Till present only the Federación and the municipality would have contributed means to the construction works, which is why a delay of the construction ending is to be expected.
"12 millions must contribute them, and although the year already comes to an end, they have given us no pfennig, and he meant this, although they would have had to pay a part to us already in July". "Not to be too late in it, we have already begun with the construction works, and they are already far progressed, but we need the money."
He emphasised that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla the state to his obligations has not followed, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan at the rate of 7 millions at the beginning of his reign. This would correspond to the amount which the central government would have had to raise.
"This had already gone for us in the last legislative period in such a way, because the state did not dispose of sufficient economic means. The programmes went on and this year we had to procure the means which the state had not raised to take part in these programmes", he explained.
Even if the state authorities are obliged to the payment of these means, he commented that was applied with the minister for management and finances, to accelerate the administrative works and to pay the back portion as fast as possible.
"Nearly 12 millions must contribute them, and although the year already comes to an end, they have given us no pfennig."
