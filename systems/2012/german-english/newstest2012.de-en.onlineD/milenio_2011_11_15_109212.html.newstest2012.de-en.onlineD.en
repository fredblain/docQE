Tomorrow the designate prime minister, Mario Monti, meets the president of Italy to introduce to this the new government which should offer the forehead to the crisis which has led Italy to the edge of the economic breakdown.
A communication from the presidency palace announced that of the Monti appointed on Sunday on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, would meet to confirm the government education.
One assumes from the fact that he will introduce a cabinet by the majority compound from technocrats, although is not clear yet, when the new Prime Minister will assume his office.
Monti said, he would introduce to the president the results of the talks with the political parties to the government education.
"I would like to confirm my absolute trust in the ability of our country to finish with these difficult times,", the former EU commissioner said the journalist.
Monti did not confirm expressly the government education, but from his comments it arises that the obstacles are overcome.
Now the "frame is well marked out", he added.
Monti has got in less than three days to form a government, this is much less time than normally. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which has done the costs for the debts in an intolerable height.
The new government controlled by the former EU commissioner Monti must dismiss a hard savings package which was demanded of the europoliticians to regain the groggy trust in Italy.
The pressure to the haste which presses on Monti still increased by the fluctuating market situation as a result of which the Italian state loans were loaded for 10 years with 7 percent of interest. This corresponds to the state with which Greece and Ireland felt constrained to apply for the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian confederation of industries Confindustria informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government after all forces."
We think that this government is the last chance, so that Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The chances of winning Montis were considerably increased by the support of the party PDL von Silvio Berlusconi who had to withdraw on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We think that the strains of the professor Monti are intended to cause good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the central right party.
The support of the PDL, the biggest party of Italy, is essential, because till present many of her members have expressed themselves against a government by the majority existing of technocrats, the Monti forms just.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures.
Opposition against his strains or putting off the reforms could cause a disastrous attack of the financial markets once more.
The Italian association of foreign banks practices with his tip, a failure Montis is over a disaster, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and enterpriser's associations as well as with youth organisations and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening the meeting round should be concluded.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano who has got going an extremely quick change of government as an answer to the crisis.
After short drawing a deep breath by the end of the last week as if became known that Berlusconi would withdraw the costs for the Italian state loans have reached as a result of the insecurity about the success of the new Prime Minister critical borders again.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt at the rate of 1.8 billions euro, would be too much for the present EU-rescue screen.
Monti said, his government must last up to the next elections which are held probably in 2013 to prefer in spite of the predictions that the politicians will give him only time to the conversion of the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti expressed, he would take up with pleasure politician in his cabinet, but the big parties insist on the fact that this should exist only of engineers, a tip to her doubts in view of from the pressure of the financial markets of imposed procedure.
Political springs point out to the fact that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements make the inclusion of people from the political life complex between the parts.
