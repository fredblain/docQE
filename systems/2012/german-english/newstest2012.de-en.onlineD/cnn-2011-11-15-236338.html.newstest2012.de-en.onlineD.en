Urgent warnings from the Pentagon before possible incisions in the defensive being
Defence minister Leon Panetta put the heating on to the congress on Monday when he warned about the fact that automatic budget shortenings weakened the national security unnoticed. With it he released a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon up to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civil production lines.
The Pentagon already thinks through shortenings at the rate of 450 billions dollar in the course of the coming decade, now, however, fears that other shortenings become necessary about 600 billions dollar or more if the congress can achieve no end in the issues.
"The effects of these shortenings would be disastrous for the ministry", wrote Panetta in a letter to the republican senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said, a failure of the congress in achieving a budget arrangement what will lead to a so-called seizure would lead to 23% of general shortenings as well as a stop more numerously of new projects.
"Such a high shortening, carried out in such mindless way, would make most of our ship projects and building projects impracticable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and damage seriously other modernisation efforts", wrote Panetta to the senators.
"Moreover, we would be made separate involuntarily from a large part of our civil staff and, because the reduction would be moved so fast, we would have to give time off with likelyhood bordering in security civilians to be able to achieve the aim."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those which maintain our military and damage our alert seriously."
At last the shortenings became the fight troops hit", said Panetta.
"While the wartime contingents are concerned in the anti-terror fight by the seizure not directly, the serious intervention in the basic budget would disadvantageously influence the war efforts", warned Panetta.
"Personnel settings will support are shortened, what for delays in the settings and the setting supervision which would wage the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be shortened what leads to late payments to wartime trader and the juridical as well as political support would be disturbed."
Both senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details with regard to the potential influence of the automatic shortenings on the ministry of defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the ministry of defence would initiate a quick decline of the United States as a leading military power of the world."
"We are vehement against this draconian action", said the senators in a common explanation on the Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is absolutely nobody that one should force us."
"The seizure is a menace of the national security interests of the united sites and their entry should not be permitted."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators raises pressure on a compromise in the budget or strengthens demands to exclude the Pentagon from shortenings, remains to wait.
Panetta has pronounced increasingly bluntly the possible shortenings, although he could collect many years of experiences with the budget in the congress and in the White House, before he came to the point of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces to heavy decisions.
In a press conference last week the defence minister painted a sombre picture what could approach - the military with bowl, but without core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"Es ist eine Brigade ohne Munition."
"It is an air force squadron without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission", said Panetta in his inaugural address in the Pentagon.
"These are armed forces which lack it morality and alert and which is not able to take up it with potential opponents."
"She makes really furiously."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta stated new details as reductions "creates significant surgical risks: Delays in crisis periods, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our worldwide application and Eingreiff√§higkeit what leads to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defensive projects of the cancelation could fall victim, were already tested including those, which and are already in the early planning phase.
The combat pilot F35 also hears to this list joint strike Fighter, a planned new bomber aircraft, the next generation of ballistic submarines which new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and navy need to substitute for the Humvee.
If one stopped the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save during the next 10 years up to 80 billions dollar, but the advocates say that there is the important next step to the armament, so that to possible dangers can be banished through China and other opponents.
