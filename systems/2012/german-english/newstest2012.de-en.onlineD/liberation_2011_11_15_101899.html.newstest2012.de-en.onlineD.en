Is immigration a load or chance for the economy?
The immigration politics controlled under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from all sorts of corners - strain of police organs, court organs and administrative organs on account of a politics subject to the figures, compatibility of this politics with the status of a "country of the human rights", as itself France itself had entitled.
The nuisance directed against foreign students of official side had recently stamped the weekly looking, the Minister of the Interior had announced by the way (see Libération from the 23rd of May) that France needs "no talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad".
But this politics was analysed only seldom from the economic point of view.
A far-reaching consensus rules because over this subject between rights and the lefts.
By right side was struck the note of Jacques Chirac who had explained in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people, under it more than 2 millions immigrated manpower, no problem for a country might explain", from left side with Michel Rocard who had demonstrated in 1990, France "cannot take up the whole poverty of the world".
The only difference exists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of the national ground by hordes of Polish plumbers was divided in 2005 from the right as well as from the left.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a load for the economy and the French society.
The only difference exists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit to which one is determined to admit towards the immigrant.
Francois Hollande limits itself in his programme to banalities which point to it, fair development allows to solve our "migration problems".
This image of immigration as a load, as a problem, can possibly affect the elections; however, she is economically costly.
How to us the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron visualise in a recently appeared work which summarises the newest knowledge with regard to the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and wanting Define Our Future, May, 2011, Princeton University Pressing, 352 S.), a wide consensus exists among the specialists concerning the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries with an open immigration policy.
To limit the immigration the growth would weaken and damage the labour market situation.
The fears compared with the influence of the migrants are based on the image that these threaten, the local manpower, in particular more slightly qualified to substitute, while they exerted pressure on their wages.
Nevertheless, the experience shows that the immigrants are substantially complementarier in truth than as the local wage-labour workers, because they exercise schwerpunktmäβig occupations in sectors which are job-technically unfully occupied.
The slightly certified immigrants work in sectors which local wage-labour workers irritate a little, more certified among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the education is not adapted to the vacancies.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country in which a lack of anaesthetists rules, this complementary also causes a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation between local and migrant.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that 1 %-iger increase of the immigrant flood causes an incorporated, long-term rise of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without consideration of the fact that the variety introduced by the immigrants of the idea creation as well as the economic growth is good (high portion of established immigrants among American Nobel Prize Laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on an average possibly at a height of 1% of the overall budget.
The world labour organisation estimates, for example, that one introduces immigrating person in the public household on average for his lifetime a net contribution (income minus issues) from about the 150,000 euros at the age of 30 years to Germany.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to cause the missing intersections "with the teeth" to beginning of his mandate.
Nevertheless, these aforesaid teeth which the immigrants should deter achieved exactly the contrary effect.
