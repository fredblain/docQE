Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Now brought to life from an Italian enterprise about fifteen years ago, Moleskine would like to lend new style to the writing again.
It has an atmosphere of adventure, with candle-light with the writing spent hours.
The notebook of Moleskine is recognizable easily again, with his black, rectangular book cover, his elastic band, the eierschalfarbenen sides, how during the time aged.
Today the Moleskine notebook, how one it knows, nevertheless, has originated in 1997.
The Italian enterprise of Modo Modo which has his seat in Milan decided to put on the market at that time a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time technical adviser of the enterprise, is instructed with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook became from a traditional production technology, called mole Skin (mole skin) inspired which calls a Baumwollack which is used, for example, for relations by settees.
This kind of notebook was asked among authors and travellers very much.
"Moleskine has animated an old and almost forgotten object which was valid till the 20th century as an icon of avant-garde artists", explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand person responsible with Modo Modo.
The success enters.
Between 2006 and 2010 the sales rise by 26% and set up with sales of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the usual production of the first years in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is explained in 70 countries, namely from France up to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, because the notebook inspires also businessmen as well as students and experts.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-spiritual customers.
Today the small, Italian enterprise which counted 12 employees in his beginnings occupies more than 100 employees and orders since 2008 more than two offices; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The enterprise expels his notebooks in bookstores, on Internet main entrances like Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centres and gets on how to put through his identity.
"We are followed the spirit of the times and his new stationary which exists in spite of the impetus of e-mails", explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: The brand has recently launched an exposition called "Detour (detour)" in which architects and artists issued her own notebooks.
In August the enterprise on the occasion of the film festival in Lucerne also put on the market a book cover with leopard's pattern.
Moleskine profited from his success and this cultural spirit of the times and knew how to diversify his products: Pockets, appointment calendars, fountain pens, computer covers... The brand shows the whole range of articles.
A success, the envious person on the plan brings: In autumn, 2006 became Modo Modo of the investment ground SG Capital Europe, the today's Syntegra Capital bought up, and whipped with it a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
