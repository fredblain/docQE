Thus was the work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali came as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano", in the history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
In the past 4th of November a Lophoskopist of the inquiry unity of the public prosecutor's office (CTI) from Cali came as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
From seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week had Eliazar González Bereitschaftsdienst, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years on criminal preliminary proceedings co-operates.
At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó where he had to proceed often during five days in the jungle to reach the place at which the corpses were which he should identify.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and to the completion of the necessary courses he specialised in Lophoskopie, this is the investigation of the skin which is put out frictions, i.e. of the palms and foot surfaces.
In the week of the application against so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was pointed out to wrap up clothes for at least three days.
Something tallness expected him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter of Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion insisted that those of the man who had escorted the oldest Guerrilla of the world can be. Therefore, he should take the 10 fingerprint sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
When he reached, however, with the Untersuchungste the place at which the corpse was, he could not identify him on account of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures which he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, carried no glasses and were much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the impression sheet.
He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano".
Still the same night this man coming from Puerto Tejada was to be informed for it responsibly of the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it really concerned the boss of the FARC.
Auf Spurensuche
For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali was the acknowledgment which the president Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González in a press conference about the application allowed to be given against "Cano" very importantly.
Many people do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without mistake rate which can be a key factor with the resolution of a criminal offence.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support inquiries in murder things and predatory things and confirm the identity of the arrested people.
In her arrest many delinquents present wrong identification papers or they have none.
We take the fingerprints from them and search this in the data bank.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall from a house with a theft, because the thief had propped himself up exactly at this point with his hand when he pulled out one with jewellery and money crowded safe.
"Walls are difficult because her surfaces are inexpedient for the decrease of fingerprints. But in this case we could take impression of the whole hand and identify the delinquent who had taken part in several thefts", he remembered.
With the help of the fingerprints can be also relieved murder suspect or be loaded.
A dead person was recently found surrounded by schnapps bottles.
With the inquiry it was supposed that a member of the family could be suspect, and really a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that it concerns the murderer, nevertheless, he is brought with the place at which the criminal offence was committed in connection.
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken by the object."
If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a tape is used to the entrainment.
Then the impressions to the Asif are sent, this is the criminal data bank, or to the personal state office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers", explained the expert of the CTI.
He meant, not everything is in such a way as it would be shown in the TV series SCI.
As well as all gold is not what shines, everything is not also what one touches, a fingerprint.
But, nevertheless, he can be used if one carries out a suitable comparison.
