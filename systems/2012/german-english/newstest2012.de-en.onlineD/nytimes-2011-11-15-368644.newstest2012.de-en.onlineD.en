Mass butchering at a personal level
Empathetically and large-scale sweetly Peter Englunds begins new book "Beauty and Fright. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen destinies" with a long list about central figures which goes for one to heart.
Here a tip, as one could go forward: Cut out this side carefully and make them your bookmark.
They will get to know these people in Englunds of novelistic story very well. And these central figures will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse at these few moments at which you are lost like Englunds men and women in the fog of the war and are robbed your illusions.
Peter Englund ist ein schwedischer Historiker und Journalist.
Besides, he is the new constant secretary of the Swedish academy which determines the Nobel prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book which he does not describe without foundation as a "work of the anti-history".
It contains only few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is hardly ambassador, raving reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about that what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was". It acts from "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and fright" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less unobtrusive men and women on both sides of the war together, from school girl and botanists up to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance driver and clerks.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some will go crazy to prisoners of war, lose limb mass, or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the Votivkerzen in a church, some come, while to others go out.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
Moreover, it corrects the image, the First World War has been only the disastrous position war in the west front.
"Beauty and fright" walks with expert's look above other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost from the outset a moving book.
The war floods the life of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina who smells of Kordit.
Fancy, you are a woman who is with her children at home, and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you remain or do you take the flight?
Who comes generally?
Hardly somebody understands what is passed or why this war is waged generally.
"Missing facts", so Englund ascertains, "were done up with supposition, acceptances, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and fright" follows single people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were taken primarily recollections, letters and other already published material.
Their life reports can be frightening or affecting, however, they are extremely alive in Englunds of the moments small in detail moulting aggregation.
Many of them act from lack and Manage.
In the history of a German school girl he tells: "Substitute, everywhere substitute."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, wrong rubber, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more about spare food in Germany.
He describes "meat which was made from pressed rice and was baked in wether fat (and at last with a wrong bone of wood it was served), tobacco which was made from dry roots and dry potato skin, shoes which were soled with wood."
There was how he takes down, "837 registered food substitutes which were permitted during the production by small sausage, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honour and bravery.
An American recognises his own urge to the wildness and says about the war: "One feels that in spite of all this is what was planned rather for men than to sit in the easy chair, to act with the evening paper or the best-seller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and thus as if such a facade means civilisation and as if there was no barbarity behind own strengthened and fitted shirt breast."
Vice versa a British soldier recognises that he presumably die and nobody of it take notice or will look after it.
"If one refrains from the thought to sacrifice itself, one would like to think that this happens before an audience", he writes.
Instead of this it is as awful as "a convicted man who was hung secretly."
Other observations act from old Europe, this breaks up, and about new kinds of the terror.
"The conflict became increasing to an economic competition", writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He catches the arrival of that what he calls "new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century": "the word skilful and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit which slaughters, while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen way and there is as frivolous behaviour like heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who tried actively to be infected with a prostitute with a gender illness to escape from the field service.
"The absurd expression of that can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken pus, because soldiers shopped and smeared themselves on her genitals, in hope to come thus to the hospital" he writes.
"Those which had really despaired rubbed him in the eyes what led to the fact that they were blind the rest of her life."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves Englunds poetry becomes smooth and, nevertheless, unobstrusively and adapts itself perfectly to his human job.
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way as the war "in unique manner provoked uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
The people start to ask themselves, why her leaders bring them to the fight.
The best books about the First World War were most rather distortedly like Paul Fussells "Great Being and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "in the west nothing new" as extensive history books.
Englunds tape joins to an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most disastrous end from which I have read in a non-fiction book.
I do not give it any more.
But it is as if he had snatched away from us with his book this side with the central figures before the nose and would have lighted with a match.
