What did the nominee del Valle lack to be the new Miss Kolumbien?
Analysis of the factors which affected that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of the Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss's title.
Once again Valle del Cauca went out blank with the assignment of the crown for Miss Kolumbien.
This time Ramírez Serna had to be content Melina to stand on the winner's platform, a silver crown and the tape which she expels as a new Miss Colombia to display.
With the result preserved this night in Cartagena where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar in herself the Departamento already comes on 14 Miss titles and Melina joins to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had held the crown nearly in the hands. Belong to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Á lvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question which many put themselves today is: What was absent?
Since the result corresponds to the decline of a big favorite who had shown by every presentation, that they about all ordered to be the new Miss Kolumbien. Not free of charge it had been chosen the queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles which had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the crown of the Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor which is valid as decisively for the decision of the jury of appointing them the first Miss is that she the answer to the question "Which book has strongest influenced you and why?" which had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, had not been convincing.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite in the literature, I believe, it is a kind to civilise itself, in the end, I think that the book which stamped for my childhood strongest is `The small prince', a rather deep book.
At the moment I read `guilt and atonement'. It is a book of the universal culture which we should read everybody. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book, the `Leidenschaften'heißt.
An answer which bumped into little requited love, first because of the concept `to itself zivilisieren'und secondly because she had explained not specifically in which manner each of her called book had influenced them.
But after end of the ceremony Melina declared to feel quietly and happily with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Read please a little bit `The small prince'. It is a wonderful book.
Among the rest, it is said that the darling von El has burnt out Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferential who pocketed all applauses and had got in the approach all prices (catering trade competition Oster had made public vote about the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre), "the other nominees jealous what the queen put under stress who could not shine, therefore, on the stage."
And one noticed this by her first image in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and with her both lifts at the coronation celebration.
Although she appeared as sure with both, nevertheless, she lacked the strength and the swing to which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the programme "Como en casa" with the canal RCN believed that the fact that Melina was crowned to the Miss "shows that the nominee who wins most prizes during the competition, finally, nevertheless, does not become a queen".
Moreover, Valle went in the end for the press from the way - a mistake.
An other hypothesis is that Valle could not persuade the Jurie with regard to her interest in the social work what is, in the end, the essentials of the national beauty competition.
It will already have his reason that two days before the arrangement of the international jury Lucy Doughty explained, they searched a woman who was involved in the social affairs of her country.
"Only beauty is not sufficient for a Miss Kolumbien. One must look out at the physical and concentrate upon the social feeling, on the fact that she had already co-operated before the participation in the competition in projects" she explained.
One also speculates that Valle with her defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose which one marked to her in the stomach area had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose them as a nominee for `natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and more responsibly physical work.
The trainer of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better ones, "but her problem with the Fibrose in the belly which was hardly to be noted for me, to tell the truth pressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos takes the view, the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgical interventions to which she had underwent have been.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how it should allow to make them right.
Their body has never been her strong point, and this place she had to pay."
Because of this price which will award the first time of the national beauty competition, a cruel prediction which should become true at night originated after the appearance in the bathing suit. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize not to let come they to the pleasure of the crown.
All the same whether this is right or is not, fact that Melina starts from today her ruling year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position which you offer the possibility to represent Colombia with one of the international competitions on appointment of the national beauty competition.
Indeed, she will come as one of the queens who had escaped in spite of her overpowering appearance for Cartagena the crown into the history.
