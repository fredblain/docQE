The menu of a child addicted to fat: It does not have breakfast and eats sausage to the supper
More than one third of the children of from 9 to 13 problems with overweight have and 9 percent of all schoolboys and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Topical surveys proved - adipöse children mostly come from families with injurious life style.
Thus appears once again how important for the healthy development of a person the environment is in which he grows up and which are examples which surround him.
Sausages stand on the tables of adipöser children up to half more often on the table, than in the families in which normal-weighty children live.
The day before more than 19 percent of the overweight children had of the clarification action under the motto "Adipositas no chance is" chips to the supper.
In families with chubby chops sport also counts not exactly to the favorite employments what concerns, however, also the majority of the today's schoolboys - answered only 15 percent that her parents the least time once a week are found for active movement.
Survey among 900 children
The survey took place the last year by the end of the school year, besides, nearly 900 children from elementary schools were questioned in completely Czechia.
This was already the second year of the action "Adipositas is no chance" which is supported by the general health insurance scheme and the society of Unilever.
Up to now took part in the project more than 12 000 schoolboys from the 4th and 8th classes.
Besides, injurious food and missing movement in the family are determining factors which are responsible for the alarmingly rising number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the questioned children stated, for example, 5 spot on the day to eat Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot in the mode breakfast second - one of the main conditions for a healthy food", so there is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage to the supper
Experts refer to the fact that also relative little things, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, importantly for the healthy development of a child are.
However, in Czechia only 23 percent of the families of the schoolboys have breakfast.
And - in most families everybody has breakfast for itself alone.
The statement which is not had breakfast in every tenth family at all was worst.
Besides, the breakfast is valid as a foundation-stone of the healthy day-to-day food.
Among the rest, the survey test brought to light that one consumes chips injurious much more often in the families of overweight children.
And almost everybody - without taking into consideration the weight - drinks every day sweet lemonades (70 percent)
Though more than 40 percent of the questioned children go in for sports, but only less than half of her parents only 15 percent do this - namely.
Put together to you your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled to well-chosen children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together her own menu to themselves from offered possibilities after appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children prefer between 12 and 15 as regards food, is far away from the ideal of a healthy food.
Under her favourite dishes there were many flour dishes, meat courses and of course sweets.
"Above all the big popularity of sweet lemonades is alarming", it is stressed in the final report for this survey.
With the lunch, so to the main course, pasta won scarcely before fowl.
Legumes did not like the children st not at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as a lunch was very low.
Hinkehr to the health
However, at the same time the survey also showed that the children are absolutely ready to change her eating habits if they get right information.
"With the control group of the survey partner, they the questionnaires after end of the clearing up talk "Adipositas is no chance" filled, a clear movement of the preferences was to be registered in many cases to principles of the healthy food", is stated in the results of the project.
This was obvious, for example, with the sweet Limos where many children began to give the priority to usual water.
The children marked in the questionnaire also much more often fowl or fish than main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumpling or sweet dishes.
