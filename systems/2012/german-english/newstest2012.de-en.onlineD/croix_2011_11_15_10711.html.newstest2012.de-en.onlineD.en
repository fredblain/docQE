Which is why does the rate of unemployment of handicapped employed persons remain open to so high level?
About 19% of the handicapped people are on search for a job.
Today the "15th week of the work begins for disabled persons".
In spite of a purposeful public politics which was introduced in 2005 the rate of unemployment is always twice as high with handicapped people than the average average: 19% against 9% Arbeitlosigkeit of the whole population.
Disheartening?
"No, so emphatically Éric Blanchet, general manager of the union Adapt which straightens the "week of the work for disabled persons" ".
"The progress achieved within fifteen years is substantial."
"At that time the rate of unemployment was not double, but three times higher."
"Still remains nevertheless terrifically a lot to act."
Nevertheless, one is said that for handicapped unemployed people furthermore numerous obstacles survive, before they get a job.
More often it meets the old people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They dispose of a low qualification level: 80% of them have no Abitur and it only 10,000 disabled persons are less than the 2.3 million students with higher educational end.
Finally the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% with the disabled persons compared with 38% in the whole cut.
In short there are so many criteria which complicate a renewed working entrance, and which form the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, general manager of Tremplin, a union founded in 1992 which helps for enterprise, besides to enlist handicapped employed persons.
So much to the objective brakes.
If the unspoken, the mentalities, to itself remains though indeed, but slowly further developing.
One in April of the union IMS-Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité carried out study bragged, the questioned managers have "a weak knowledge level with regard to disabled persons", "überrepräsentiert" is "from people in wheel chairs, psychically or intellectually less-wealthy".
Result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees still have to achieve a wide way before themselves, around the employment aim of 6% of handicapped employed persons which was established in a law of 1987.
These last-named, from 2008 to coming figures refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
"Now we are with about 3%", reports Pierre Blanc, general manager about Agefiph, the organisation which is asked to drive contributions of enterprise which ignore this law.
The proof: The number "fees more paying" company sites has decreased just as the sum of the deposited amounts between 2007 and 2011, namely zahlenmäβig from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The law of the 2005 which intends increases in contributions created a strong pressure on the enterprises, explained Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a real knowledge in particular with the groβen company groups."
According to the ministry of work only 59% of the company sites between 20 and 49 employees occupy handicapped employed persons, enterprises with from 100 to 199 employees against it 82%.
