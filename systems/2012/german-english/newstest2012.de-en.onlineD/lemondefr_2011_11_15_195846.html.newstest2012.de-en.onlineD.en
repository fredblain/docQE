The CDU suggests choosing the EU president on account of general casting of votes
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14th of November in Leipzig ran for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairperson of the Christian Democrat party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was planned originally not in the programme, but has asserted itself in autumn, in particular around that activist is enough to perform who estimate the government policy concerning the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidency application suggested by the presidium of the European Commission was accepted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates only nine had been right against it, ten had abstained from the voice.
The Standing continuing several minutes ovation which were valid first Angela Merkel as well as some hours late Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen on the part of three European-leant towards Ministers of Finance no doubt on the basis of their intervention decrees openly.
The main idea of the chancellor carries - just as the application - the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only, because Europe peace is meant, but also because "nine million jobs are dependent directly on the euro".
For the chancellor "the time for a breakthrough has come in Europe".
This could be expressed by the control of the European Union encouraging modification of the Lissabonner contract concerning the budget politics of the countries in the eurozone; nevertheless, also this could flow in the choice of the president of the European Commission on the basis of general casting of votes" to lend a face to Europe".
Nevertheless, this is anyway one of the application proposals adopted by the congress to which unambiguously Wolfgang Schäuble was the inspiration.
Absolutely it is likely only a little, that 47 to themselves quickly on this revolution to some: Gro  Britain is faces to the thing negative, and the leading of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is.
Nevertheless, the landmark is laid.
Also the delegates have rejected the proposal of the weighting of every country in the EZB board of directors according to the weighting of the single Ökonomien in the overpowering majority what would bring obviously an Erstarkung of the position of Germany with itself.
Hence, on reassurance of the climate within her party careful chancellor has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. Nevertheless, she has not tried any more to win her congress at the expenses of the "small ones" or the European countries itself located in difficulties which would immediately criticise haughty Germany.
As far as the European application of the importance of the "German French friendship" dedicates a section, does not shout Angela Merkel France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Since this reminds of the fact that Leipzig stood two centuries ago in the centre of a bloody battle.
Actually one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
