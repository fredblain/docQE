Trade union of the responsible persons will lodge complaint against the town because of dismissals
The trade union, the hundreds of school responsible persons, the last month her job have lost, represents, plans to sue the town on Wednesday, because the dismissals inform on account of her immoderate influence on the schools, the poor students, are not necessary and discriminating.
The complaint is probably the last possibility, which to cancel of the trade union, district advice 37, in her efforts, the dismissals, is still open.
672 school assistants, care co-ordinators and other employees who belonged to the most badly paid-up employees of the town and had lost on the 7th of October in a manoeuvre her work the trade union leader as a political revenge for the fact have described that one had refused last year of the town the access to a health ground which the working groups maintained with which the budgetary gap should be closed.
This accusation were categorically rejected by the authorities.
On a hearing of the town council said Dennis M. Walcott, manager of the schools, last month, the dismissals have been a part of the budget that one has dismissed in June.
A member of the town council shot back and explained to him that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school help would be dismissed.
Employ of the town council 37 said, they would have and warned the ministry of education about a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which submitting the complaint is announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally.
The complaint will perform Mr. Walcott and the ministry of education of the town as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as a plaintiff who are all coloured or Latin-American women, like most of the assistants which have lost her work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the town, said, the complaint would not be given to the town and therefore cannot be commented to their single assertions.
According to a complaint draught which is given to the New York Times the trade union has concentrated upon the number of the dismissals at the schools in the slums of the town to support a complaint because of unequal treatment. She states that poor schools had lost more assistants, because they are underfinanced chronically.
She demonstrates that, while there were no dismissals on Staten Iceland and only few dismissals in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants have lost in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 assistants were dismissed in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the statement of the loss of five of eight school assistants who were done in the public school 36 in Harlem where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint means: "This is no neighborhood of well-to-do parents who can organise donations to catch budget shortenings."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was shortened this year by 3.26 percent. Moreover, money got lost when the town changed her calculation method for the extra financing for every arm school registration.
Moreover, the trade union deplores that the leaders of the High Schools were escorted by the language in a memo in Crazy which approved the dismissal of the care co-ordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (in German: transfer) in the USA usually the change of a teacher of the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers describes who are paid by the central office.
"66 care co-ordinators were dismissed, not transferred", says the complaint draught.
