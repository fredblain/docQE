Mujica travels to Mexico to the strengthening of the political relations
An official deputation, stated by the Uruguayan president José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and enterpriser begins her visit of Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between both countries and to discuss political subjects of the region
On next Wednesday Mujica meets his Mexican colleague Felipe Calderón. This will be according to the Uruguayan president the climax of his booked-up appointment plan with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the group of the Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The discussion of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suited for the exchange of information about all politics areas between both countries", announced the presidential office of the South American country on his website.
According to local media Mujica searches the support Calderóns concerning the incident with France when the French head of government Nicolas Sarkozy on the summit of the G20 put the South American country on a list with tax havens in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries which still appear as tax havens, from the international community. This explanation was rejected from Uruguay and arranged an inquiry with his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has since November the chairmanship of the G20, a group consisting of the mightiest threshold countries and industrial countries of the world. Since January of this year an agreement about the exchange of tax information about the avoidance of the double disposition with the South American country exists.
The government of Uruguay has tried during the last years to accelerate the ascertainment of agreement for the exchange of tax information to be stroked from the "grey list" of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (OECD). The countries which have introduced not all international standards to the cooperation in tax problems stand on it.
At business level a free trade agreement exists since 2004 between Mexico and Uruguay which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between both countries.
