Steiferer Yen
Noda threatens with a new intervention at the currency markets
The Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda has warned on Tuesday about the fact that the Japanese authority intervened once more at the currency markets, if the yen should rise furthermore.
"Should we ascertain an excessive Volatilität" in the exchange rate of the yen ", we will also intervene as we have done it the last time", explained M. Noda in the senate.
On Tuesday the yen had jumped up again near to the historical levels which had forced the Japanese authorities on the 31st of October for intervening.
On this day Tokyo had sold massively yen against dollar to lower the Japanese foreign currency value which is about to head for a new record value since 1945 compared with the dollar.
Nevertheless, the yen has risen regelmäβig about that, doped by purchases of the investors who look at the yen as "a shelter value" in these unsafe times of world economy recession and indebtedness crisis in Europe.
The dollar has liked on Tuesday less than 77 yens, the euro has slided under the symbolic slat of 105 yens in the nearness of the levels which had the last intervention getriggert.
Before the financial crisis in 2008-2009 more taken down the dollar around 120 yens, the euro more than 160 yens.
This straw fire of the Japanese foreign exchange damages to the exports of the archipelago, because it raises the price of the costs of the "maggot in Japan" products and diminishedly the income value pulled by Japanese companies from abroad, because this this one they exchange in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake as well as the Tsunami on the 11th of March which have laid waste the region of Tohoku (north-east), for his reconstruction", stresses M. Noda which fears this price increase of the yen can kill the weak impetus already in the germ.
The third economic world power has won with the growth in the third quarter-1,5% in comparison to the preceding quarter for the first time this year thanks to the fickle Exportzunahmen and the consumption of the households "sealed" by the disaster once more in tractive power.
Nevertheless, the prime minister estimates that the price increase of the yen does not reflect "the economic foundations of Japan".
The Minister of Finance Jun Azumi has asked on his part the bank of Japan of (BoJ) which has opened a 2-day meeting of her currency-political committee on Tuesday to seize all conceivable Maβnahmen to weaken the yen.
Nevertheless, Hirohide Yamaguchi, acting governor of the institute, has informed about that, "geeignete Maβnahmen" has already initiated the BoJ with which he allowed to announce that on Wednesday no additional currency relaxation is to be expected.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October the central bank had raised her state bond buyings by 5,000 milliard yen (47 milliard euros) to erase the 55,000 milliard yen (519 milliard euros) cover amounts which she had used for different purchases of finance titles to flood the liquidity market.
