Asphalt of the UNAM prevents blow holes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the faculty for chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops modified asphalts with polymers to make the mixture more resistantly compared with weather terms and temperature variations
It would be respected to the signs which go out from the paving, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 blow holes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher said at the faculty for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured that if laying out and the maintenance of the asphalt layer happened appropriately which are decreased number of the blow holes considerably or are avoided even completely.
In his paper "blow holes from technical view" which he read on the occasion of the international year to the chemistry he announced that the lab for which he is responsible with polymers develops modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt which shows, nevertheless, a bigger mechanical resistance with high ones as well as at low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera believed that this kind of modified asphalts should be used in areas with extremely hot climate, as for example in some towns in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the paving and to avoid with it the appearance of blow holes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the oil - is a carbohydrate compound from which a part has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they lend to the paving be a typical viscous elastic behaviour.
Viscous elastic behaviour of the asphalt means that this behaves at high temperatures of nearly 180°C like a liquid, with 120°C he is very viscous liquid and is almost firm with 50°C, while he becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"That is that the robustness of the asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but changes on one day as a function of the weather terms and temperature variations", explained the industrial chemist.
The researcher of the FQ noted, the streets of Mexico town would have by the majority an adaptable paving which consists of six material layers from which contained the last three asphalts.
Between the uppermost layers lies a wear layer from asphalt which exists of small and stones bathed in asphalt hardened then.
Every single little stone of this wear layer, has been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good force distribution in the paving.
"If it was a modified asphalt, would spread the forces even better", believed the industrial chemist.
"About the wear layer", he explained, "the last layer is laid out, the so-called Tragschicht which exist of tiny stones, i.e. of sand which was also bathed in asphalt.
Because this layer are in the contact with the vehicle tyres, they need a bigger mechanical strength than the wear layer and they friction must produce.
This paving most forces receives and distributes, needs the Tragschicht, moreover, an adequate thickness and the material of which she exists, must be kept in good condition.
The weather terms, in particular humidity and temperature variations, are other, important factors to be considered, before all things the water", he said, "then it affects the behaviour of the wear layer considerably.
If the area becomes humid, water penetrates into the layer and resigns only difficultly again. This causes a softening of all layers of the paving and consequently the appearance of blow holes.
If a blow hole originates", he said, "the overlayer is used first, while the wear layer is affected only afterwards. But the damage originates not immediately, but it concerns a process which would have to be kept in good condition with the first signs by adequate servicing programmes."
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is an other important cause for the appearance of blow holes. Therefore, the thickness of every layer of the paving must always stand in proportion to the vehicle load and it must be made sure that for the avoidance of frequent blow holes this regulation is kept.
Rafael Herrera pointed out to the fact that still many research projects kept waiting, for example, about asphalt emulsions which are in other countries even already at the market and with those itself the blow holes simply and without use of high temperatures allowed to repair.
