Athens lets arise doubt again
Papadimos says, the economy measures would be dismissed, but the conservatives will sign no written agreement
With the forced up risk premiums of the peripheral countries and spreading insecurity Greece gets also lost further in the labyrinth that from the big European debt crisis leads out.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek caretaker government is rather a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly booked by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday to the fact pointed out that there would be no alternatives to the structural reforms and that are with his appointment to arranged hundred days possibly too briefly for their conversion, the leader of conservative party of Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samara assured that he the new economy measures support and on no account his demand of new elections to the intended date to which the 19th of February, will take back.
"The most important job of this government is the conversion of the decisions which were met at the summit from the 26th of October", assured Papadimos yesterday for the opening of a parliamentary debate which will reach her high point tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package with 24 programmes for the occupation support, to the reform of the disciplinary law for official and new measures against the tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, communication of Samara does not clear the doubts about his position: "We have ourselves to the support of the caretaker government obliges, but, otherwise, to nothing."
The conservative leader went for 1 step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IWF, to the organism which has to do the 8000 millions which Athens urgently needs entsperren. He clarified that he favoured no obligation explanation about the fulfilment of the economy measures.
But yesterday the European Commission which is still irritated because of the effects of the poker play with Papandreu referendum confirmed once more, her demand is not to be shaken: The economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the most important Greek parties did not sign "an unequivocal written agreement as soon as possible".
The speaker of the economics ministry, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the Troika came back "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government, "what is necessary for the payment of the sixth segment" at the rate of 8000 million euros "", although there is still no final date.
The Greek ball still has for threads for a while.
