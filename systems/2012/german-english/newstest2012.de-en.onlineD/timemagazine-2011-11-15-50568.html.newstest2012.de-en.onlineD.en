7 lessons of the interview with late Steve Jobs which was shown this week at a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on the 5th of October some compared him to Henry Ford and emphasised, besides, the technology genius as a big modern inventor.
What Apple fans find, however, maybe most informative during the job interview discovered recently again which was dusted this week before special screenings at the important markets, is, how much this creative head has understood commercial processes and work routines.
He was absolutely a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who did handicraft keenly in diagrammes - a man who thought that many managers suffer from an "illness of the thinking", "that a really wonderful idea 90 percent of the work puts out... (however), it gives a huge amount in craft art between a wonderful idea and a wonderful product."
In 1995 Bob Cringely developed the TV series "triumph of the nerds" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat longer than one hour with jobs together in which they led one of the rare, detailed talks.
At that time had passed as 10 years, since jobs from Apple had been pushed. And he already worked hard on his new computer enterprise of NeXT, and was glad about the wide acceptance of the Internet.
While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in nerd, he says that the copy presentations of the interview were absent by the delivery.
Only after job death one discovered an entire VHS copy in the garage of the manager.
This easily revised film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The lost interview" which comes this Wednesday and Thursday to the land mark theatres.
For somebody who is known for the fact that he abhors to detailed interviews appears to jobs here unexpectedly keenly in the explanation of his technological philosophy and commercial strategies.
And incredibly thoughtfully.
In the course of the interview it comes four spots to longer breaks between question and answer - from 10 to 15 seconds of contemplation in which job weighs unambiguously his thoughts and takes care around exactness.
There is also moments at which Jobs' perfectionism comes by days if he reacts apparently impatiently to Cringelys questions and him anschubst to come faster on subjects or subplots of bigger meaning.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone taken up the lost interview seems anyhow awfully farsighted if values jobs what other enterprises of his opinion make right or wrong and his own vision explains to the future of the computer.
It is a thing to read posthumous acknowledgments of the career Jobs'. But to see jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to the grandeur, is completely different a little bit, original and inspiring.
He has a vision as the things could be and had to go his.
Briefly after he had explained this here everything, he set out and made it.
A quick look at seven noteworthy sequences of the lost interview:
How he learnt to lead an enterprise:
"During the whole years in the business I always ask: "Why do you do things?". And the answer which you always get is: "Oh, so it is made easy."
Nobody knows, why he acts what he does. Nobody in the business thinks really thoroughly about things.
I have ascertained this.
Jobs explains his efforts further to rationalise the accountancy with Apple.
Amazes as costs were taped - mostly one began with "standard costs" which were numbered on bare supposition and which were adapted then with "divergence" - he developed an automated factory which made sure that the business expenses could be determined till the smallest.
How the pope was made fun:
Jobs tells about the "Blue of box" which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could creep into the phone society and lead long-distance calls free of charge.
About the device it was written already a lot, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue to box as an act of the Selbstbem√§chtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he tested the box, while they use a subject to charges phone, a phone call effect and then combine from an AT&T network in another, while they so many satellites as possible durchschleifen.
"We sent things half-dozen times around the globe and if one bawled in the phone, it came out one minute later in the phone next door again", tells jobs giggling.
"We were young and we learnt that we ourselves can build up something which can control billions of dollar in infrastructure in the whole world."
We both, we did not know a lot, but we could build this small thing which can control a huge thing, this was an unbelievable lesson and I do not think that there was Apple without them.
Jobs further tells about a glorious prank, the Wozniak and he has nearly departed when they called box in Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue and wanted to speak with the pope, while they so well them were able to do Henry Kissinger copied.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called over in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, had to do both loose laughters, before the pope came even to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technology (and unpreparedly Bill Hewlett called):
At the age of 12 years when he looked for spare parts to build a frequency counter he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer a part-time job in Hewlett-Packard.
"This had a noteworthy influence on me. It was the only enterprise which I had seen at the age and it formed my views about what was an enterprise and how well it treated his employees."
Later became jobs one of the HP employees who visited the research labs of the enterprise in Palo Alto where he saw "the first desktop computer which was one day produced".
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown mole tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb with HP as a teenager upwards and hang on this machine and write programmes for them.
How one improves innovations:
Several times during the interview speaks job of how one spontaneously invents new products.
Quite early in his career when he inserted some boards he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment term of only 30 days and had to think through the assembly as well as the delivery of the ready devices.
Later with Apple he remembers the problems which he had by the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember crucial arguments... They shouted at me that it would last five years [around a mouse to build who would cost 300$] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse whom we could allow to build for 15$. This was incredibly plausible.
About the big enterprises who decrease:
Long before he allowed to revive Apple, foresaw jobs the ways on which so many industrial giants with her visions got in tripping and lost the control of her shares.
"Do we say, you work in IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopier or printer, so what?"
They own the share monopoly, so the enterprise is not successful any more.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are such people] who lead at last the enterprises and the product with which the people from the decision-making are pushed.
The product genius which has led to this monopoly position becomes from the people who have exterminated no draught with regard to good products versus bad products, - craft art inevitably.
This happened with Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the whole computer industry.
One could have been bigger ten spots, if Microsoft of the 1990s could have been...
They have got the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"A lot of craft art lies between a wonderful idea and a wonderful product... if one this wonderful idea developed, she changes and grows."
One learns a lot about his delicacies.
One must carry out votes, certain things which one is not able to do, but electrons, glass, robot, factories.
One must notice to himself 5000 things, bring together these draughts, and them all...
At last it runs out to the taste, it runs out to the fact that one have tried, have created with the best stuff, the person, puts apart and then tries to bring together these things to him what one makes.
Picasso said that good artists copy, wonderful artists steal.
We are always shameless in the stealing of wonderful ideas.
Part of that what made Macintosh wonderful was that the people who work there were musicians, writers, artists, zoologists, historians who are by chance the best computer scientists of the world.
If it had not been the computer branch, they would create in other areas fantastic things.
