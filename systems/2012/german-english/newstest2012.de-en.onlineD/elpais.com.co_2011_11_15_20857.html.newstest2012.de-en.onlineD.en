The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together in tents on the place Zuccotti.
A large part followed to the eviction order and changed his location in a nearby park.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street challenged the authorities of New York on this Tuesday when they tried with a judicial arrangement once more to enter the place Manhatten, after they had been removed at the break of dawn by the place and had tried to take another place in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded together before the place Zuccotti on which they wanted to get admission with a judicial arrangement which permitted the renewed tents to the "indignant" at this point. Meanwhile another part of the movement kept to the eviction order and took a park further to the north in the town where it came to nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not permit us to camp on the place we meet at another place and continue the battle with juridical means around the return to the Zuccotti, with sit in the peaceful demonstrations", said Mark Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy of Wall Street".
Bray explained that the answer of the "indignant" to the clearing of her tent camp which had been arranged directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York came up to court where the judge Lucy Billings spent an arrangement which forbade the forcible clearing of the place and approved the demonstrators the tents.
Moreover, the "indignant" took a new park which is at the crossroad of the centrally situated Canal Street and the Sixth avenue very close to the entrance in the Holland tunnel which connects New York and New Jersey and property Trinity Church is.
They could take the place during at least 1 hour. But then the police arrived and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray can give no exact figures. He assured the news agency Efe that he has seen under it also several journalists with handcuffs.
The organisation assures, hundreds of people would have appeared on it at this point in which also a deputation of religious leaders had arrived as a token of her support of the members of the movement and to the mediation with the police.
In the meantime, the place Zuccotti (an area in private property) remains unanimously in expectation of a judicial hearing which is still attached for this Tuesday and with which the legality of the clearing taken place at the break of dawn should be analysed.
Some of the demonstrators done by the place carried photocopies of this judicial arrangement on themselves and distributed them. They gave them even to some policemen who guarded the place what entailed "some small collisions" as Bray reported which had registered, some policemen would have hit demonstrators.
The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street of the place as well as the use return from the "laws which were dismissed after the occupation and to forbid that the demonstrators with her tents and other things, which had used them already before in the park."
Mayor Bloomberg clarifies before the press which has been lifted on account of this judicial arrangement the renewed opening of the place for the public traffic and the demonstrators. He pointed out the demonstrators to the fact that the town laws did not allow to them to prepare once more with tents and sleeping-bags at this place.
The mayor defended personally the clearing carried out at the break of dawn of the Zuccotti place with which nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided because the demonstrators "offended against the right."
Bloomberg explained, he would have given the arrangement to the clearing of the place because this had changed "into a place in which the people came not for demonstrating, but to the break of the laws and in some cases to do harm" to other people because "some shops would have received threats" and the local residents were worried "about her quality of life".
"The clearing at the break of dawn was revolting and shows that Bloomberg is interested basically in the protection of the finance interests and not in the protection of the interests of the North American workers", the speaker of the movement added, that the mayor did not accuse "the freedom of the press to respect".
The persons responsible of "Occupy of Wall Street" informed that they thought to organise "big actions" for Thursday to think namely together with local organisations and trade unions, in two months which already last the protests since the 17th of September now.
