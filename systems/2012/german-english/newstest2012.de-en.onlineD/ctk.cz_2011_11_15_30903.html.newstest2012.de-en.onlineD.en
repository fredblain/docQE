The general meeting should find a new chairperson - again threatens a stalemate.
Already during nearly five months the Czech football has no chairperson and with the fact threatens that the successor to Ivan Ha š ek becomes not even known at the head of the Czech football association (FAČR) after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Till this day there is because still no arrangement on it after which electoral law should be chosen.
And without this no vote is possible generally more than three potential successors.
Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomá š Paclík.
In June ha š ek withdrew from his function and he his colleagues by the exit requested had to agree and to find a strong personality which can lead the football in future.
Only - in the era after ha š ek the old quarrelling broke out between both association chambers once more which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This appeared plainly on the 16th of September when the new chairperson should be selected.
The delegates of the general meeting had completely come free of charge to the national house in the Prague quarter Smíchov, because the negotiations led to no result and, besides it was not only about the choice itself.
One could not agree because sometimes on who is actually eligible to vote with the full collection - only the representatives according to statute or also the officials equipped with an authority.
In this only point one achieved at least partial arrangement to what also the recommendation of the institute of state and right contributed whose opinion is not admissible after a representation on authority base.
Nevertheless, the disputes around the electoral law continue furthermore.
Also the executive committee did not bring any more clarity in the thing, with which meetings - all the same whether well-arranged or extraordinary - in principle, generally nothing else more is on the agenda.
Even if the views changed concerning the choice a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same one.
The question is: how should one go forward in the 3rd round to avoid a deadlock?
"The contentious issue concerns the question whether one should go forward according to the statute, or whether quite an other model must be found", ascertained you š in Svoboda, one of three acting chairpersons of the FAČR who represents the professional football in the management.
According to model according to statute wins in the third round that candidate who receives the bigger percentage support in the chamber for which he runs for election.
Moravia is supposedly ready to come on the compromise that that candidate wins who receives the higher voice number from both chambers.
The Czech side insists again in the condition that the winner receives at least one two-thirds majority with this percentage vocal counting up.
"Then both qualifying rounds have generally no more sense, this mode would question the whole bicameral draught", Svoboda understands the objections of the mährischen side which it would find best to choose the electoral law not hinzubiegen, but according to valid statute.
To him agrees astonishing-wise also Tomá š Paclík, even if becomes clear that the electoral law according to statute of all candidates meets soonest probably Pelta.
"It is my wish that as much as possible is chosen after the statute."
"So that no senseless spare variations are devised, like at the last general meeting", explained the owner (soccer club) Victoria Plze ň who runs for election for the first time and differentiated himself in his statements above all compared with Pelta.
However, Pelta remains optimistic.
According to his opinion the new chairperson becomes known in Nymburk and he thinks that the candidates work together in the future also constructively.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the Fußball-EM at the present day would certainly contribute to reassurance of the minds."
"If the football rides only on the euphoric wave, the readiness is also bigger to the cooperation", believes the official from Jablonec who brings from all three followers the biggest experiences and this at professional, as well as regional level.
Rajchl is reserved there.
"I hope for an arrangement, but, unfortunately, the situation is ambivalent."
"This is no thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts "to bend into shape" the regulations for own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blocking is not excluded at the general meeting."
"Nevertheless, I hope that at last the healthy common sense wins", said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to the agreement of all sides does not remain any more.
Some negotiations should happen supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals are generally complete up to the qualification play.
The charter flight stuff with which, among the rest, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical disturbance at all and thus one looked feverishly for a spare variation how to bring a part of the executive committee, nevertheless, still to the venue of the cash rage's first leg one.
At last the meeting is nevertheless probably vital at cabinet level to which it should come supposedly on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe š, the minister for school system, youth and body education would have moved the split parties within the biggest sports association of the country with pleasure to an arrangement.
It gets up because a lot: state allowances, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV which should show the new direction to the Czech sport after the finance problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes to the fight for the position of the chairperson because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomá š Paclík, the boss of the Pilsner footballers could have put out a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled to all his images about the new chairperson of the football association of Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have got involved at all in the fight for this top position.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the choice."
"But in the present situation one did not succeed in finding such a follower", said Paclík ČTK.
The principal reason for Paclík to go to the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to be prevented it that of the supposed favorites of the choice, Pelta, to the point of the FAČR reaches.
Paclík also stresses that he thinks to exercise the function of the chairperson only one year, so till 2013, up to the appointment of the well-arranged general meeting in case of his victory.
In the position of the chairperson he would have seen with pleasure an experienced top executive who is involved not too very much in the football events.
"With some possible people I have spoken personally."
"To think hardly that some said me, they did not want to identify currently with the Czech football.
"Such views would have changed with pleasure", he stated.
Mostly from all Paclík disturbs supposedly the connection Pelta's with the chairperson of the Pilsner district football association Roman Berbr, to a man with controversial call which is valid behind the scenery as a mighty lobbyist, with the ability of influencing delegate's votes at general meetings.
That's why for Paclík it is unacceptable that Pelta would hold the position of the chairperson.
"In his victory would become the today's state einkonserviert and in the Czech football it would not lead the way at all."
"The support by Berbr, a clever businessman, would agree to the football twice badly", stressed Paclík.
Herewith he also leads on the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with phone hearings to the inquiry in a Korruptionsaffaire from which Pelta arose, nevertheless, with impunity.
"I do not know, which prestige a victory about Pelta to him (tsch). football should introduce."
"And how we would stand there in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said řekl Paclík which his former remark, "he will sell the Pilsner soccer club if Pelta of chairpersons becomes", sees, however, already a little more calm.
Should Paclík win in the Thursday choice, nevertheless, he can fancy a future cooperation with Pelta absolutely.
Just also there thinks another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík before the general meeting in October had supported which ended with a fiasco.
"It (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has big abilities".
"I could fancy him well, for example, as a boss to the national team."
"But I do not think that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I do not put my nose, nevertheless, in matters from which I understand nothing", said Paclík which had provided in September with it for sensation that he headed behind the recall of the referee's commission with Lu ďě K Macela for which Dagmar Damková substituted.
Paclík itself states, he feels grown to the role of the association chairperson.
And, besides, appeals to his abilities with the management of private companies, since the last summer he is also a boss of Pilsen which celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups which tend to influence disciplinary commissions and appeal commissions what degenerates till disgusting situations", stated Paclík which makes no secret from his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta boss Daniel Křetínsk ý.
As one of his priorities he would look at the strengthening of the relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympia's committee with whose help he would become with the political leading politicians for it lobbyieren that more money from the lottery tax flows into the sport.
"This is one of the determining things to which the new chairperson should devote himself".
"If it comes for the taxation of luck plays as the political parties declare, then I understand her argumentation, then, however, they must also speak in no uncertain terms where the money goes", he said.
His connection with the Pilsner club does not look at Paclík also as a handicap, although he himself stresses, the chairperson of the FAČR must be "nonparty".
Pelta is again with Jablonec form an alliance, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not quite ideal."
"It makes to my opinion, however, also not a lot of sense to transfer my shares in the Pilsner club hypocritically on a third person to return again after one and a half years", clarified Paclík.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would exclude a deadlock in future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association one of the candidates promised for the chairperson's office, namely Miroslav Pelta, he will make himself strong in case of his choice for it that the FAČR gets new statutes which exclude in future disputes about the electoral law from the start.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign will certainly ease with a possible success of the Czech choice.
Pelta had already promised before the not realised choice in September, he wants to concentrate in case of his choice upon the national team and the production of funds.
He resolved only on the last moment to take part at the choice before the last general meeting and thus the 2-month break might help him to defend his images about the management of the football and to introduce in a broader context.
"People at all levels devote themselves to the football, they are impatient and, hence, expect that the chairperson is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is escorted by somebody, believes the man who is connected above all with the Jablonecer club which operated, however, also many years with Sparta and in the executive committee.
Also, therefore, he believes that he disposes of sufficient experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is persuaded that the euphoria is responsible for the today's problems with the choice which ruled at times of Ivan Ha š ek.
"Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June statutes were approved which were not so perfect as it everybody had accepted.
If they had not permitted different interpretations, we would have had from September already a chairperson", believed Pelta.
He used just the reworking of the most important document of the civil union as a lure for the delegates.
"Should I become a chairperson, I take care of that personally and is to be carried ready personally responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing without which he cannot be", states Pelta.
Subsequently he does not try to differentiate himself towards his opponents.
Before he had announced, he can fancy a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl which he recognises because of his juridical education and he well knows that his rival candidate would be his first deputy.
Also Tomá š Paclík he did not attack for a long time any more which left no dry thread in Pelta again.
In the football he already moves about a year and can already refer to certain success."
"Nevertheless, his attacks were slighting and many people were shocked by his electoral campaign."
"Now also, therefore, many doubt his real character", addressed Pelta to his opponent who remains loyal probably his Proklamierungen which have already expressed he in September.
According to his opinion his strongest weapon is the knowledge of the football of the lowest play classes, up to the national team.
And this should be the signboard of Czech football.
"I would also try to finish all Affairen - from the Causa Bohemians, up to reverberating the corruption scandal of the last year."
"Immediately afterwards I would rush at negotiations with the private and state sector to guarantee sufficient funds for the whole football", said the 46-year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time he also promised that his move will mean no personnel purges in the point of the Czech football.
"I would have to make myself close first of all with the working contents of all employees", he said in the direction of Strahov where on account of the long anarchy understandably nervousness rules.
In spite of dezeitigen to the katastrophischen scenarios which accompany the upcoming general meeting he thinks that the delegates do not go on Thursday free of charge to Nymburk.
"If really the only debatable point should be as one chooses in the third round, then we get over it."
"The football needs credibility and he thereby wins back that only if he has, finally, a new leader", Pelta two days before the possibly deciding day of his official's career remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR starts to work under him hard
If the present acting presiding Jindřich Rajchl at the general meeting should be chosen on Thursday the new chairperson of the football association of Czech Republic, this would spoil supposedly for many people in the association the mood.
Rajchl promises because that one starts to work in case of his choice hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold responsible the members of the executive committee on single football areas.
Moreover, he promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relations with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money in the football and to continue otherwise the work which previous presiding Ivan Ha š ek has begun.
"As a chairperson I would like to devote myself to the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, about the national choice, the professional football, up to the achievement football for the youth."
"With it I do not want to say that I want to make alone everything", said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and, hence, would like to distribute the competence in the executive committee in such a way that every member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard duties, so that the football makes headway in every segment with mile steps."
About that many would be delighted not exactly because she instead of criticising only the work more different now really hard start would have to to work", he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement has taken into consideration not to run for election at all any more.
"By me is known that I work 20 hours on the day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who do not throw to me incessantly bat between the legs and every step which I take, question", he said as an explanation, why he has hesitated.
"However, many people said me that I may not surrender because it, otherwise, also others would act."
"This is a trust which one may not gamble away", he said.
Supposedly also motivates him to be allowed to continue the work which he has begun under ha š ek.
"In two years we have mastered a big piece of work and now I simply do not want to throw away this."
"Processes were begun which are effective quite only in a few years and I would see only reluctantly that stop them somebody", he believed and expresses herewith his doubts, that to itself for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen who could return situation in the times before ha š ek.
"I believe in systematic action and this is something what does not bring Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him stand above all people who would make the football in such a way that he would be there only for chosen."
One can probably accuse me of something, but not that I would be biased."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everybody because it goes well then to all and not only the chosen", noted Rajchl.
He also contradicts the assertion, he is only one chairperson of the Czechs.
"Even if some people maintain the opposite, I really plan to do the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is to be considered time whether one should not divide the league into a Czech one and a mährischen part whose winners climbed up then in each case in the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three mährische clubs play in the league what is a problem particularly for the young players in Moravia", believes Rajchl.
Because now also the boss of the Pilsner club Tomá š Paclík to the fight for the function of the chairperson has joined, does not dare Rajchl to estimate his chances that he is chosen.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber which has chosen me her acting chairperson and recognises now that clear success stands behind me", stated Rajchl which also looks at the saving of umpteen million crowns about unbecoming contracts, the arrangement of television contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he puts on himself partly the blame for the fact that the association does not move in one single rope.
While he says of Pelta, "he would be disqualified from the start to help the Czech football to new trust", he holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who really has to offer something to the football.
"Nobody can question that he has performed in Pilsen in only one year of excellent work."
"Should he be chosen, he would probably continue the things which Ivan Ha š ek has initiated and also he would not change the personnel occupation in the commissions obviously basically."
He would not want the things certainly in his favours hinbiegen", judges Rajchl about his rival.
