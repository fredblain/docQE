Austria
Registration of a "golden budgetary rule" in the constitution
The government itself located in Austria in power of the groβen social-democratic / Christian Democrat coalition has decided on Tuesday to take up a "golden budgetary rule" in the constitution to reduce public deficits and also to avoid a possible degradation on the part of rating agencies in the top credit standing of Austria (AAA).
Social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann was extremely personal who had announced this decision of the exit of the council of ministers, although the public Austrian state guilt is with 74.6%, so by far about the criterion settled by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, however, clearly below the debt level of the countries like Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If had not sunk the solvency of Austria on a blow of AAA on FO +, we would have to pay every year three milliard euros of interest, in addition", Michael Spindelegger, vice chancellor and Christian Democrat Auβenminister argued.
Austria also grants of a demand of the Brussels summit of the member states of the eurozone from the 26th of October: At that time the heads of state and heads of government would have required the admission of the reduction of public deficits till the end of 2012 as well as a return in the public account balance in the constitution or by decree of an equivalent law.
The Maβnahme seized moreover by the Austrian government resembles the "German model", because Germany had been the first European country which had taken up such "a rule" in the constitution.
Up to 2017 the structural budget deficit should fall every year about 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the federal state should not cross 0.35 % borders of the GDP, while the regional states just as the municipalities should show well-balanced households.
Aim is to eradicate the budgetary debts under by the Meuse funnel agreement of settled 60 % criteria in the horizon of 2020/21.
