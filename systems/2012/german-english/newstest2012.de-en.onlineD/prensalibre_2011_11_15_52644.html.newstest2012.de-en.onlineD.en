The schnurrbärtige plumber enters 3D country" the third dimension with "Really Mario
Really Mario has never fought for 25 years untiringly for the rescue of the princess Peach from the claws of the bad Bowser, however, till present in three dimensions: in "Really Mario 3D country" he fights for the love of the girl in stereo-technology.
The play which comes this month on the store bars of all world, was cut from the outset on the qualities of the portable console Nintende 3DS with which can be played without special glasses three-dimensional.
"Mario is the figure which must say how the stereo copy functions without glasses", assured Omar Á lvarez, the person responsible for the press specified on Nintendo in Spain by the image of the video game in Madrid.
Á lvarez explained, "Really Mario 3D country" is "the first video game of Nintendo which has been developed from the outset for this console", because till present successful articles were like "star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" adaptations already existing title.
The speaker of Nintendo underlined that, although it is three-dimensional, "Really Mario is 3D country" an "affordable" video game which permits a quick, liquid play.
Á lvarez confirmed that "Really Mario contained 3D country" two plays in one: The first part is "light" to catch the less geschckten users.
Then the experts about the different play levels which become more and more difficult can turn the "second round".
Moreover, the users can choose on a real-time basis between "aggressive D" or to one which affects only the draught of the action. However, for overcoming the obstacles without becoming victim of the "optical effects" must be played always three-dimensional.
This excursion Really Marios in the three-dimensional world also means the return of the figure to a portable console what has not been since 2005 any more the case.
With this video game Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last issues: The schnurrbärtige plumber must overcome larded platforms with dangers to release the princess Peach.
Indeed, the player bumps into news with the movements, the environment, the disguising and the enemies - and "playable" Luigi.
