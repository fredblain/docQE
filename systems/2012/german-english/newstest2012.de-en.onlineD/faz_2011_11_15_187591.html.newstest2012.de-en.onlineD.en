The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went in the financial crisis almost bankrupt and slides since that time from a crisis into the next.
Now a German should direct it.
Thus it had not thought to themselves Axel Weber certainly.
After his spectacular departure of the point of the Central Bank had become known in July that he would start in 2013 a nearly as spectacular new job: Administrative council president of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was glad publicly, praised Switzerland on account of her beauty and the UBS on account of her solidity won anew and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has created the Turnaround".
"I am glad about the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
However, already in September it became clear that everything would come quite differently.
A trader of the UBS in London had avoided all protection systems of the bank and about 1.7 milliard euros verzockt.
UBS chief executive officer Oswald Grübel, one not only in Switzerland of praised bankers, had to go.
The administrative council president of the UBS is valid since then also as groggy - and everybody asks: When does Axel Weber come, finally?
Already became known that weaver may discuss the bank from February, 2012.
And he does not take the administrative council chair already in May - only in 2013 as the bank informed on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes hard.
He is no banker, rather economy professor and mark banker and would have needed a settling-in period absolutely.
Then with a blow he takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that she earns long ago the title "the biggest scandal bank of Europe".
Since the UBS is gigantic on the one hand - till recently she was the biggest property administrator of the world - and slides, on the other hand, for many years from a scandal into the next.
Nothing, so it seems, remains saved to the so proud Swiss bank once.
It began in the financial crisis.
Till 2007 had the UBS an excellent call.
The image hidden and respectable, but also ausgebufften Swiss property administrator had combined them with ambitious sighting: It also wanted to become in the Investmentbanking quite a big number.
Thus the UBS 2007 administered on the one hand dollar of more money of wealthy customers than any other bank of the world with 1.6 billions.
And, on the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank on the league of the biggest banks of the world.
This made impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I have put my student the UBS at that time always as a pattern of a good bank."
"From today's view one asks himself: How could I wander only so?"
He was wrong immensely.
In 2007 became for the first time obvious that a little bit severely went wrong in the UBS.
At the middle of the year chief executive officer Peter Wuffli withdrew unexpectedly who was valid till then as a highly intellectual and as brilliant banker.
Some months later one anticipated, why he had gone.
The investment section of the bank had itself with Subprime papers verzockt and had to copy milliards.
To shoulder this, an increase of capital announced the UBS at the rate of would you believe 13 milliard fr.
For it she really found investors, indeed which about whom some would have to the still nose shortly before gerümpft: an intransparenten Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arabian state fund which was so hidden that one not even found out his name.
However, this was only the first blow.
In April, 2008 it came more badly.
The bank had to announce new milliard losses, administrative council president Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still in the second-best paid-up administrative council of Switzerland, withdrew.
In October, 2008 followed the disaster: The UBS stood in view of her bad investments in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought of the UBS for umpteen milliards problematic securities, the Swiss confederation gave six milliard fr for a compulsive change loan about which she could become a co-owner of the bank.
Whole Switzerland was shaken - then she noted how dramatic it is for a small country if it accommodates so big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet total was the UBS 2007 more than five times more largely than the economic achievement of Switzerland (see graphics).
"Once again we could not save the UBS", says bank researcher violinist.
The second one joined the first disaster.
Already few months ago capitulated the UBS in the tax quarrel with America and agreed to publish the data of wealthy customers who had evaded taxes possibly with the help of the bank.
Besides, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unwarranted profits from these shops with penal impact.
With it confessed the UBS more or less openly to have helped in the tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something which had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the aureole of the discretion.
After the scandal the Swiss banking secrecy was not any more the same.
There followed the resignation of chief executive officer and administrative council president.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus the bank within less months had lost her credibility in both central business divisions: in the Investmentbanking by the false speculations and in the administration of property by the help to the tax evasion.
And even as it became a little quieter again, even as one thought, now it will do the UBS again, there follows this unblessed trader's history: A single trader verzockt 1.7 milliard euros, before the bank notices that something goes wrong.
And it becomes obvious: With the risk management in the Investmentbanking it does not work obviously yet.
"With the case Adoboli one had to find out that the risk control has changed not enough", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor in the banking undertaking of the university of Zurich.
Also the finance board of directors of a big German bank is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that it does not control the risk control."
Nevertheless, besides, it had been exactly the idea of the care with which the Swiss bankers had lined up long ago to become guardians of the big property of the world: no much too big risks, for it security for money - the world might also break down beyond the Alpine republic sometimes.
The safe deposits of the Swiss banks had become the symbol for steadfast reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still fit to the stereotype of the good-quality Swiss private bank - she is bigger only a little bit.
Already the situation is classical.
The bank has her head office in Züricher Bahnhofstrasse which leads from the central station directly to the Zurich lake, from the snowy summits of the Swiss mountains frames becomes.
Here the buildings are magnificent, the store rents belong to highest in Europe.
One finds jewellers like Tiffany's here between Swiss traditional shops like the cake shop Sprüngli.
Since centuries here reside the Swiss banks: from the national bank about the palace of the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
One enters the reception hall of the UBS by a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-dressed up, before it thick leather armchairs, beside the bank logo a big sign stand to the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer searches here: Security.
Both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, however, have edged out this idea of the Swiss bank sometime - or have betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would not like to read his name rather in the newspaper, finally, he makes, like all Swiss bankers, also with both major banks deals.
The UBS has become too big a lot, he thinks - above all in the Investmentbanking where, besides, Anglo-Saxons would have spread out.
The Swiss would have to say there nothing more.
"And if, nevertheless, they have adapted themselves long ago to the customs of Anglo-Saxons."
Really it was the anglo-saxon Investmentbanking which changed the UBS, her only high profits gave and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost so much money like the Swiss major bank in the Subprime jungle.
On the 15th of October, 2008 the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small 7 million country decided the biggest rescue operation in the history of her nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash".
Up to 68 milliard fr or about 45 milliard euros the politicians granted to save the major bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How could it come in addition?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem above all in the size of the UBS.
In June, 1998 two three Swiss major banks united to an immense group.
There originated a bank which was already too big with the coalescence for small Switzerland - and on and on grew.
Helped in the fact that both different precursor's banks of the UBS were complementary: a rich, but sleepy bank with the main focus Administration of property in Zurich and a poorer, but already stronger made international.
Suddenly the made international investment bankers came favourably in a lot of money with which they could turn a gigantic wheel.
Two names are with this rise of the UBS form an alliance: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 group boss of the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, at that time chairperson of the administrative council.
"I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-level intellectual, modest who understands a lot from models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly person who has worked way up from the bank traineeship to completely on top."
But Ospel has counted in the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli has made at the end probably a determining mistake: "He thought, his models are the reality", says violinist.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragically, maybe.
It is clear: High spirits came before the case.
Employees of the UBS clearly remember the executive's meetings on which group boss Wuffli over and over again spent the same slogan: Goldman Sachs of the throne bump.
The American bank was the mightiest investment bank of the earth.
She stated "League Tables", the ranking lists which documented the success of the banks of that time.
There wanted the UBS, after completely on top.
Some steps had already succeeded to her.
In the foreign currency business and in share trade she completely joined in on top.
Nevertheless, the management consultants who were instructed emphasised a weakness: In the international interest business, in the Bankersprache "Fixed Income", there is an immense distance to the biggest banks.
The UBS has gaps with American mortgage products.
To close this gap, proceeded UBS in an adventure which it cost almost the existence.
Hungry after growth, invested the bank as well as a Hedgefonds founded before her in American Subprime arrangements.
She developed to an immense machine which packed securities on American mortgage loans and handed on - however, besides, kept also even risks.
Still when other banks searched long ago the climbing out.
"Still in summer, 2007 when the American property market was aflame, has bought the UBS there", says bank expert Geiger.
So largely the euphoria, so deeply the case.
A manager after the other had to go, than to clear up the attempts more difficultly fell out than expected.
Posts with the UBS became the catapult seat and are ramshackle till this day.
Who leads the major bank now, has a nearly impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank to which all obvious commercial models have got lost.
Bank researcher violinist already has an idea: End with the Investmentbanking, concentration on the administration of property, return to the Swiss roots.
Though completely so far the bank (still) does not want to go.
But the Investmentbanking should shrink hard, now so much is quite clear.
On the next Thursday the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to introduce his future strategy.
The 51 year-old Italo Swiss was intended, actually, only as an interim solution, as the bank separated unexpectedly from predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile he has asserted himself: He should carry on permanently the business of the UBS, informed the Züricher bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to drive back the investment bank on the state in the middle of the nineties.
In 3500 he strokes places.
However, this will not reach.
A vision needs the UBS.
Who is she?
With which wants she to earn money?
These are the questions which Axel Weber already puts himself certainly now.
Publicly he says up to now only, he will search a flat in Zurich for himself with his wife first of all.
The next year.
