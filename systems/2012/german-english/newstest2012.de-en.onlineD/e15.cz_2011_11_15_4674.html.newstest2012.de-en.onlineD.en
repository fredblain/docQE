The Innovator IBM steps the second century of his existence
If one wanted to look according to a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most exactly characterises, then this would probably be the word "Longevity".
For the wide public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as a modern enterprise, although since his foundation already one century has passed by.
The basis to this longevity already laid her first boss - which visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems can be easily solved if the people were ready to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" became thus the brand name around which the life of the future giant should happen (and at the same time to the title of the company internal magazine which one started to publish in IBM already in 1935).
This was also the basis of the enterprise culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement in the direction of future.
IBM survived and was also successful, therefore, a whole century because there has remained loyal to his principles and not before it zurückschreckte to change all other all around.
This permitted us to transform the technologies, the business and also the society in the course of our first century.
We hope which we create during the next hundred years even more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the today's manager of the enterprise on the occasion of the jubilee.
Thought-out system
Watson already pursued during the thirties years social care of his employees - in similar manner, how the enterpriser Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people had as one of the first American employees paid-up vacation, an assurance by the enterpriser plus elegant uniforms as a working clothing and a thought-out remuneration system of the best innovator and trader.
Just also the long-term relations are thought out by IBM with her customers.
The enterprise was brilliant from the outset in the talent support - as one of the first companies IBM lifted worldwide any Diskrimination - and could select itself accordingly.
In harmony with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the present plan, the Palmisan at the head by IBM next year of a woman is alternated - from Virginia Rometty.
It is already present thirty years in IBM, up to now it took the position of the Vetriebs-boss, marketing boss and strategy boss.
IBM makes during the last years so-called on-line brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations arise.
There is no miracle - ideas enough, in the enterprise nearly half a million people is occupied.
An institution with good call
Their steadfast position in the business guarantees for the enterprise a strong image and this after Inside and after Outside.
"From the outset IBM had rather the draught of an institution than of a bare technology enterprise", Economist said the professor Harvard business School and the author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is no technology enterprise, but a company which helps to solve commercial problems help of technologies", George Colony of Consulting company Forrester Research added.
As the enterprise itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present at the market or to form him by this presence directly.
IBM - in the states of her logo because of informally "Big Blue" called, has grown up in a century into one of the biggest enterprises of the world.
It is one of the most many-sided technology enterprises generally - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation achievements in an unbelievable product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology.
From all American technology enterprises IBM owns most patents and already five his employees were distinguished with the Nobel prize.
E.g., cash dispensers, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code or also the disk belong to his best known inventions.
With approx. 220 milliard dollars of market value (market capitalisation) IBM this year was the second largest technology enterprise (immediately to Apple) and it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of the customers from today - unhappily the calculators were, for example, the attempt with own operating system OS/2, the on-line service Prodigy or also IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the Vorwärtsbewegung, so one may not bind himself emotionally to the past", believes about it Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build his foundation walls on different platforms - and if they do not function to leave them also again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft which stands, in principle, with his operating system Windows and falls.
Promising technologies
Services take part in the biggest measure in the profits of IBM, software and hardware take part too in each case to one fifth.
Besides, hardware with a more than 50-percent portion was strongest represented still in 1990.
Nevertheless, since 2000 disposed IBM little profit throwing down assets to the value of 15 milliard dollars, in the same time it invested 58 milliard dollars in the purchase of future-laden technologies.
In this Investionen IBM also continues after 2008 when the modern financial crisis swept for the first time like a storm about the world.
Also here IBM to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson remained loyal who raised his investment dimension in the middle of the big worldwide economic crisis.
Up to now it seems that the enterprise IBM gets over the today's crisis regardless of.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 rocket-like about 120 percent and the clear profit of the enterprise grows kontinuell.
The enterprise slogan of IBM is: everything cannot be changed - only the values.
Also, therefore, may be expected that this adaptable giant also masters the next crisis.
IBM history: From the cheese tailor to universe flights
In the beginning 100 years ago in New York founded society IBM (Internationally business Machines) had a surely complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording corporation.
She took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was about a brand name for an establishment in Canada and South America.
The coalescence of four enterprises whose history goes back till the 80s of the 19th century laid the foundation-stone to the later society IBM.
They owned technologies as for example the famous Stechkartenuhren to the registration of the working beginning and working end.
Charles Ranlett Flint who also held the chairmanship in the supervisory board till 1930 became the architect of this new enterprise.
And it was Flint who put the boss of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that this helped him in the management of the enterprise.
Then this leader put even the founders of IBM in the shade - the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise is based on Watson's ideas till this day.
Watson led the enterprise till 1952.
IBM, began as already the name betrays, with the production and the distribution of all possible machines for trade - from sausage and cheese dressmaking, up to cashes.
In first four decades in which Watson led the company he doubled her turnovers on nine million dollars and the enterprise expanded bit by bit on all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat whole during forty years in the chief armchair, only then he was removed from his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his management IBM started to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed also the first computer language.
In the 60s engineers and computers of IBM of the NASA flights helped in all to lead - to the Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of the person to the moon.
Meanwhile, developed IBM in 1964 the first calculator family with the same calculator architecture - the row of IBM System / 360.
A classical PC which determined the computer standard of that time came on the market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
On the other hand, twenty years later disposed IBM his calculator production to the Chinese society of Lenovo, bought them, nevertheless, the adviser's part of the enterprise of PricewaterhouseCoopers and herewith got completely into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.
The strategy which pays off IBM during the last three years is the draught "smart planet".
It embodies the intention to use technologies in clever manner in areas planned not even up to now, e.g., also for the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the town management.
In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the platform "Smarter Commerce" which should help the traders to lead the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has in Czechia a strong history.
Already in 1932 IBM founded an establishment in Czechoslovakia at that time - as the generally first country in Central Europe and East Europe.
Today, among the rest, IBM ČR pursues also a strategical Outsourcing centre in Brünn.
The headquarters for Central Europe and East Europe settle in Prague and here a top research team of international standing is also that deals with the technology of the vocal recognition.
