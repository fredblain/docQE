Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalised, according to an expert's committee
The Canadians live in refusal of the death as it arises from a report of the royal society of Canada
The committee explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and doctors concerning analgesic treatment worked together around the best analgesic means to provide, and this also about the cancer cases going out.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal position towards the death.
Only 9% of the Canadians get really involved to speak with her doctor of conditions under which they would like to die and arrangements hit for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report of the royal society of Canada in which six experts were involved who are tied together in different fields, among the rest, ethics, right and medicine, with each other.
This committee recommends to the government to change so the penal law to permit accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice positions itself, namely with the patients who are looked as in the situation to make such a decision.
As a prelude the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent society EIU which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the globe with each other.
Although Canada has placed itself, on this occasion, on the 10th rank, the study notes that "the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has produced a culture in which the people are afraid to broach the subject Death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to analgesic means, report to us about the royal society of Canada ordered expert.
And in spite of the majority wish of the Canadians to die at home 68.6% die, nevertheless, at last of these in the hospital.
From the whole country is looked the rate with 86% in deaths stamped in the hospital in Quebec highest.
In the awkward question with regard to euthanasia and accompanied suicide the authors of the report come to conclusions which are of the position of the federal government which already has geäuβert to want to carry out no changes of the penal law with regard to euthanasia and accompanied suicide entgegengerichtet.
Now, however, there is according to the experts who have examined gleichermaβen all those countries whose beginning legalises euthanasia and accompanied suicide or entkriminalisiert have, no proof that such a decriminalization would cause Miβbräuche in their use, so of the practise realisation of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or not agreeing people.
On the contrary one meets substantially more cases of such violations just in the countries in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalised, like yesterday Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, in a tele-conference confirmed.
"Euthanasia is carried out in Canada where it is unambiguously unlawful."
"Also accompanied suicide is carried out in Canada, although here unambiguously illegally", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians recommend the euthanasia
If we visualise that themselves according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in 2010 already 85% of the Canadians had in favour of the euthanasia geäuβert, because they believe, this allows to people at the end of her life to reduce her sufferings.
And 66% think that the circumstances of a legalisation of the euthanasia does not entail to provide the message, that the life of older or handicapped people less value besäβe.
Concerning the people who have already carried out an accompanied suicide the interviewees represent the opinion to 41% that these should be pursued not criminal.
What concerns maintenance or setting of the means with patients, situation explains as less clear, according to the authors of the report.
Also these suggest in her recommendation list that should be given in the penal law that setting down the means for which a valid refusal has been given should not be valid as criminal.
In addition, the expert's committee demands that experts of the health service should be trained in the job, setting down the means in the end of life to respect, and to have to fear this without criminal pursuit.
The committee explained that governments, institutions of the hygiene and doctors worked together concerning analgesic treatment to provide the best analgesic means, and this also about the cancer cases going out.
At last the committee concerning already in the Canadian institutions to the hygiene demands extensively applied means to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take into consideration at least this, because these served just as little like the euthanasia to reduce physical pains and these would refer to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts on the legal area of the health service have already brought forward reservations concerning the conclusions of the expert's report of the royal society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, has called the position of the report-signing experts, among the rest, "extreme", because this of the euthanasia practise sets no limits with sick people in the final phase.
"This opens the gates for a situation, in which every which is weary of life and older than 18 years to ask another person be to him with his suicide helpfully to", according to RA Deschamps which had looked through yesterday a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report seemed to put the own responsibility of the singles about all the other values which are involved in the social Gewirke of the society.
Now however, so he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, has also expressed "a strong opposition" compared with the conclusions of the report which she addressed as "a pro-euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville whom even member of the royal society of Canada is doubts in particular the report data with regard to the non-presentation of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalised, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
