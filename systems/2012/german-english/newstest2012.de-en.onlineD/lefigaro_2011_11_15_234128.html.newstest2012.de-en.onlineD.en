Terrorist front gets on, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is disturbed about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The relations already long standing under suspicion between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday the Algerian Vize-Auβenminister Abdelkader Messahel had confirmed itself that Algiers has now about that "certainty attained".
"The way with which both organisations go forward as well as the relations of the Secret Services point to a clear cooperation" he declared without next in the detail to go.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The inquiries about the kidnapping taken place in the last January of two French in Niger has promoted interfaces by days.
In a restaurant in Niamey of followers of the Aqmi kidnapped Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory should have become on the next day the same time like several her kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special units getöten.
French and Nigerian investigators want to have found in the remains in the place of action several phone chips which belonged to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the controlled phone phone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, in Niger as well as in Nigeria.
According to radio France international (RFI) the investigators interest in particular the numbers of two interlocutors: A number leads to a Nigerian who had stayed long time in Maiduguri, a town in the north of Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is valid as the Aqmi and the champagnes close.
"This is a progress, nevertheless, one must wait undoubtedly for more unequivocal documents, before one can speak of a surgical cooperation between Aqmi and Boko harem".
"However, it is conceivable".
"One knows for many years that the sect covers financial and intellectual support of Auβen and that this is active increasingly", the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo tones down.
During these last months these "support achievements" have become more and more obvious in her course, also the addresses as well as the operation modes of Boko harem which point now to consulting of suicide assassins as well as the application of always complicated growing explosives which carry the same manuscript like those which were used by Aqmi.
The international community to start near Washington has exerted pressure on Abuja since this time, so that one takes into account there for the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have judged the grouping, indeed, long time about as a community of Illuminaten which must be given no special attention.
Quick success
In 2002 in Maiduguri in surroundings of a mosque, a school as well as the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf founded Boko Haram - what means in Haoussa so much as "the western education is a disgrace" - the establishment of an Islamic emirate pursues in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this impecunious region the union finds out rapid success.
She politicises herself and claims strict observance of the sharia, while they exert themselves her attached activist in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The activists have first churches, bars and authorities in the visor.
In 2009 the activists of Boko Haram with her reinforced attacks against the commissioner's offices were especially active.
Nevertheless, the reaction on the part of Abuja is as normally indifferenziert.
The army surrounds the town, one counts 800 dead people.
Mohammed Yusuf taken in captivity is killed in the prison.
Consequently the sect becomes visibly more radical and leaves her strongholds in the north.
The last Christmas she confessed to an attempt in Jos which demanded 80 human lives then to next in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram the guilt of a suicide attempt is assigned which occurred in the secure police headquarters in Abuja - first to his kind.
In August the local seat of the United Nations gets to the priority international target.
The education of a terrorist axis in Africa which should lead from Mauritania via Nigeria to there to Somalia disturbs since then all security experts.
While the Aqmi Mali and Niger have taken which Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko harem seems to be a new menace in the centre of the continent.
The last week hatta Alain Juppé on the occasion of a conversation with president Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko harem warned and itself ready shown" to inform of all tips".
