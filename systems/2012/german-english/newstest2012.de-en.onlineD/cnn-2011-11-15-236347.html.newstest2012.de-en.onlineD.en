How one unmasks a lie
A look at the topical headlines shows how questionably and widespread deception and lie are in the everyday life.
The presidential candidate of the Republicans, Herman Cain, is occupied to become a sexual harassment on the part of several women man to the accusations. Both sides accuse themselves mutually of the lie.
The management of kipping State is accused of the Meineids, because one has held back supposedly reports according to which a retired football trainer has abused boys sexually.
Last week it was cobelonged over an open microphone when the French president Nikola Sarkozy stated towards the American president Barack Obama, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner came along to the fool when he brought denials in circulation which were disproved very fast by irrefutable proofs.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the offence in the campaign financing which stands in connection with the cover-up of an illegitimate affair.
And then forgets of course nobody who has experienced it, the media circus which president Bill Clinton has released when he has lied during his second term of office in the oval office with regard to his sexual respect with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories Cheat at school and in college check are widespread.
There were incidents in which teachers her students have given the exam answers, so that they themselves stood there with her achievement examinations well.
The mentors who should teach the opposite dispatch news that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
How studies book, we lie every day between 10 and 200 spots.
However, many these lies are valid as white lies.
Another study shows that strangers deceive themselves mutually three spots during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To recognise lies or "to uncover lies" one is to learn is important for every person, and this from personal ones as well as for professional reasons.
Far from a parlour game as for example Scharaden remotely in which it is the aim, "Has you!" to shout, unmasking a deception is a serious field of knowledge which is based on scientific data which were collected in the course of the past six decades at respectable universities who carried out far-reaching research projects, in particular in the areas of Psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths about the lies were unmasked.
Lies look to one in the eyes.
They stutter, stammer, blush and not always thrash.
However, out of this one may not close that these liars are hard to be uncovered and to be unmasked.
A skilled LÃ¼genenttarner can penetrate to the truth, while he learns something about the structure of the assertion, the fine expressions, about question and timing.
I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the exposure. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern ability which is easily to be learnt and helps us in finding the way in our complicated world, particularly if the adjusting or questioning of people or negotiations or management belong to own professional responsibilites.
Good liars are very good to estimate other people, to wake up interest and to control own emotions. And they feel intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know, the extrovert person lie more often than introverted people that men dish up more often "selforiented" lies than women whose lies orientate themselves more "by others" - as a rule they want to protect with it the feelings more different - that married people lie to her partners less often than unmarried people (however, the lies which they tell, are most "fat lies").
We also know that if a person was unmasked as a malefactor other feel less guilty to have lied to this person.
How does one recognise whether somebody lies?
As the first, while you observe the normal behaviour of this person.
One calls this "Baselining", the starting position.
She gives a reference point to later valuing of changes.
Observe the position, the laughter, the vocal quality of her experimental subject.
They should better know, when somebody ordinarily minces constantly with the foot, so that they accuse him not wrongfully if he minces during a meeting with the foot.
Then you pay attention to accumulations more conspicuously of verbal and non-verbal behaviour patterns.
Look at these accumulations as alarm bells, the shrill, not as a proof of an exposure.
The people who are deceptive maybe solidify if they try to remember her history. Maybe her feet point in the direction of door or them lean in the direction of exit, change her position in significant manner or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing exhaling and the change in the position if all hard questions are over.
Questioners often signal falsely that an interview is past, only to keep a lookout after this relaxation after the interview.
Pay attention, moreover, in language of your experimental subject.
The gaffe of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he stated, his killed wife is still in live and a national search for her released.
Being deceptive people can also use an outdistancing language: "I had no sexual respect with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question in the whole.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if they answer a tricky question: "To say the truth now... around you... so far to me is known... after the best knowledge and conscience."
Through this the answer becomes rather perceiving as objective by which often the alarm bells shrill.
There is no magic cure for unmasking of lies, but one can learn abilities thanks to which an exposure is possible.
Thanks to these abilities everybody can become more seldom the victim of swindlers, in Privately like in the professional life.
