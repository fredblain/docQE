The nicest pools of Europe
Jump in the blue
Von Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in UFO optics, splendour pools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, his nasty surprise can experience - and rest the tired legs in mineral water baths after a town tour or a wandering.
A book points where wellness is the nicest in the water.
If iris Meder went during the past one and a half years on search trip, might not be absent one in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Backward recumbent on the water, she high awaited in skilfully formed domes, she swam marble putting which waited in the pelvic edge for them, and was astonished at meticulously restored Jugendstil swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, it took up it swiftly in her notebook - with worth knowing details about the construction method and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming-pools architecture historian Meder explored in this manner - and introduces them now in her just appeared book "Badefreuden": National swimming halls in Munich, historical bath palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete structures" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "trip to the most unusual baths in Central Europe": Beside Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and in each case a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bath culture enthusiast.
With sport she does not have a lot in the hat, says Meder - only in the water this is different.
Annoyingly only that swimming fans must resign themselves to blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the beguiling smell of spruce forests or listen in happy bird's twitter in the park.
"One day I have asked myself, why swimming-pools must be so ugly, actually, always", says the Meder living in Vienna.
"I started collecting nice baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Geplätscher in the jump washbasin and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so big, therefore because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if have given themselves the builder trouble, swimming halls can be a true feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor one has in baths a water surface."
"She is transparent on the one hand, however, on the other hand, the beauty of the whole building reflects."
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, coloured tiles, springboards.
The compact illustrated book "bath joys" provides interesting facts about the architecture history and cultural history on 190 sides of historical wellness oases - however, above all desire for a jump makes in the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered noteworthy copies by her searches in Hungary.
Beside splendid medicinal baths like the 100 year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest she found nitrate-containing waters in an earthy two-pronged mattock cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath whose washbasins are filled with alkali-containing water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
However, spectacular views offer many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one has the whole town in the eye of the Züricher roof bath, one can look in the outside pool of a bath in Saint Anton at the snowy mountain Arl - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the activity on the ski runway.
The maybe most unusual pool design expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like an UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three upwards open bowls it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztals rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming-pool the smell of chlorine rose to the pool collector Meder in the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in Á rpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks it so strongly of fuel oil which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen healing water which is almost black and whose sludge to one sticks to the skin, as soon as one sinks in the washbasin - a wellness experience of the special kind.
Nevertheless, at a place iris Meder on her search for nice bath places was also disappointed: When she wanted to visit the free bath and solar bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it found a barred terrain.
In 1902 from the architect Du š in Jurkovic formed bath was closed, in the meantime.
When Meder had a look by the weather-beaten windows of the red-white-yellow Jugendstil building, she saw how weed grew rampant between the tiles.
Has counteracted against the decay one, however, in an enchanting swimming-pool in the Black Forest: to the palace of Thermal in bath Wild bath.
This bath has three construction phases already behind itself; one can discover not only neoromanesque elements which come from times of his establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in the Alhambra style which was added about 1900.
Since the careful modernisation in 1995 is of the palaces of Thermal the favorite bath of the pool expert iris Meder - and this not only because she comes originally from the Black Forest.
"It is already an achievement to melt thus different architectural styles to such a great unity", says Meder.
With such a palace the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a secondary matter.
