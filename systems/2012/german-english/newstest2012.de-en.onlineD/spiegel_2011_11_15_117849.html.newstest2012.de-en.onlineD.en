21st house in Vienna
Der umgezogene Pavillon
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with heights, depths and happy end: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion of Brussels in 1958 gained prices, became in Vienna the museum, stood empty and neglected.
Now he is reopened as an exhibition house.
If is swarmed about modern post-war architecture, from clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials which are typically for the faith in the technical progress then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brüssler world exhibition 1958 is a suitable and famous example.
At that time swan's cerium pavilion got the Grand Prix d'Architecture for his light and floating active steel glass construction.
The construction is valid till this day as a landmark of contemporary architecture.
He announced the architect in such a way that also with the next world exhibition of Austria pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW-four cylinder house plus bowl-like Nebenbau in Munich he became famous in 1973, finally, internationally.
His as a temporary exhibition construction planned pavilion one had put up after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden with the Viennese south railway station, had done alterations and in 1962 had opened in it a museum of the 20th century - the "20th house" was called it.
However, the building was suited neither spatially and technically as a museum - no walls to the slope of the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long, until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has altered the pavilion, now he is called "21st house" and is used in future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum of Belvedere to which the house belongs opens there the first exhibition - a piece of luck in every regard.
Has put through the fresh start Agnes Husslein-Arco whom in 2007 new manager of the Austrian gallery of Belvedere became.
Husslein-Arco, conferred a doctorate art historian with substantial career among other things in the youth as an Eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby's, the home Guggen museum and as a foundation manager of the museum modern Salzburg, put through the rebuilding emphatically with politicians and preservationists, they procured public means and private sponsor's money and fixed the use.
Except present art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the endowment of the same name, there should be a café and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built in addition.
Strict supervision, small budget
Then for the realisation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had altered Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitively and had extended and had won the competition, but because he has studied under swan's cerium at the University of Technology of Vienna and the pavilion for him a "tremendously important place" was at which he had had a look "almost at every week-end" the exhibitions.
He knew the old draught, and he knew the problems of the building which already lost with his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung to generosity and ease.
With the current rebuilding there were far bigger problems: The building was "an energy catapult", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was substituted with special shatterproof glass.
Cold bridge steel bearers have been strengthened or been substituted, and asbestos-full covers were redeveloped.
Two basements brought place for the new use, a lowered light ditch between house and street provides for the exposure, still the light swan's cerium-pavilion leads to the entrance a bridge - nearly one new building, but.
The original outside doors have remained, the house is stroked in the old red-brown rust protection-tone.
And the film hall still is certainly in such a way as he was former.
And all that under strict supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"A material had to be often found which is good and is cheap and also liked the conservation of monuments and historic buildings office", says Krischanitz and points to a rough ground in the basement.
In spite of all compulsions, problems and rebuildings the building is adaptable and has remained light.
It has been difficult with the pavilion, "from Brussels came along", has recently said Krischanitz, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte".
So an architecture stands "always at the wrong place" and wants to wake, nevertheless, "a right consciousness".
However, in this case the 21st house is not at the wrong place, because a town planning piece of luck has stamped in it: Round the Swiss garden originates just the "central station accommodation" planned absolutely anew, with office houses and dwelling houses.
And another piece of luck will maybe still enter: The 21st house could get strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary arts centre, and how one hears, she already negotiates with the town around a nachbarschaftlichen location in the Swiss garden.
