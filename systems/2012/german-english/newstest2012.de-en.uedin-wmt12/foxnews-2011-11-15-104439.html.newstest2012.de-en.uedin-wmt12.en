Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be revised after exposure to delayed US approval
The Obama has a few days after the government threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered many unions and calmed environmentalists at the same time, the company is the pipeline would try to plan the project so that we can return to normal.
Trans-Canada said on Monday evening that it will reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area in the Nebraska Sandhills.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building of Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of Trans-Canada, said that the company remains confident that will ultimately approved the pipeline, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week, after which it is to postpone a decision on a federal approval to the project until the new possible course should be reviewed to avoid the area in the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a large under water supply.
"This is a real step forward," the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, said on Fox News.
The new environmental review, which has ordered the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, even though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a function of the State Department and its support too said.
The 1,700-mile pipeline linking Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
They would be 700,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta province pumps to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six states.
They hate environmentalists, but markets love it, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the Nebraskas legislators who oppose the plan to weigh up the legislation to force a retreat from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the chief auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, who was hired by Trans-Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton is mired in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was contracted to carry out the original study, an inappropriate choice, as it is with Trans-Canada.
