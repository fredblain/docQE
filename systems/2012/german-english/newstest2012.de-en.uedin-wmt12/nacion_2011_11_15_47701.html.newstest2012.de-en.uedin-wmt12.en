For your Costa Rica niche fans realizing a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Be aware it means you what that for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play a dream, which for us is also implementing.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and until now it has been great.
I was just once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will certainly remain a few days there.
For us, it is exciting to get our music there.
I ask you this, because the fans of the band are shown. They are the days before the concert working flat.
What does her your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years to be on our side.
We have almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you to have waited so long and we're sorry to have taken so long before we got here.
Some people are even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have had in the past 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they are fit for this concert made in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have to play there inclination.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you have got to know their Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always on the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua drive, together with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.
With an eye on the tour their giant shows have offered with many songs.
What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there, we are also no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few Song from each album and give our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
She never repeats your repertoire.
So why?
I believe this is partly because we have nine plates and about 120 songs play. Everyone like another song, so the decision, which we will play each, is not easy.
If we have two or three Song that we no longer have long been played, into the repertoire, we can maintain our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we have liked this Song, otherwise it could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates her your twenty history.
If you look back, it is hard to believe you on your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band, and over 20 years, it seems like a dream.
We also have further on this blessing and it is wonderful to be able to still make music together.
We like us and we are delighted to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What was it for you to have participated in the birthplace of Grunge active?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of big bands.
We are good with the people of Sound Garden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and very unusual, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Sometimes a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle-group.
Still sometimes we play together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Garden on their tour, and we are delighted to still be friends with all of them and it does us to be part of this encountered Seattle-Sounds.
It is very unusual for a band like your is stayed together with the same musicians so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) fell 13 years ago. This alone is much more time than last for many bands.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care for each other.
We are all close friend and musical avenues have opened, which give each individual freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other, and its music. It could not be better.
Your relationship with the glory has not always been easy; on the other hand, can make her thanks to your success always what wolltet her.
As she strikes a balance?
The way we have grown, has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
As long as you think that the people have come because of the music, it reminds you that you've got the music and what it has created, respect, without being too keen to be a famous rock star, which has never interested anyway.
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love bone?
I believe we have made very good Song and at the beginning, it was great.
We were three years a band that had been issued by the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never a record.
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore, who built with the band, friends. When I hear a song or photos, see, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me funny. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that she knows their work, especially, Eddie Vedder, and the band have selected for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos by various groups and the band liked best, so we are curious to see what Las Robertas can provide live, and this is certainly exciting.
Why do you change the text of Yellow Ledbetter whenever plays her live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that occurs to him.
By whom you got to be influenced as Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to come to mind Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski belong...
There are so many that I could all afternoon on the Bassisten who liked to talk.
As Pearl Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although they are no longer a fad?
I think we all do not feel very close with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, come to mind the band, which I have mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, nirvana and all other that emerged at the same time, if they are still important, I think this is great, because it is interesting to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is more positive.
So why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few Song on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly, but there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe deemed to be a very dark Song, although they also have something positive in itself.
Both the tears came to me when I heard they played like Ed. There are very dark Song.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend, it affects your artistic creation and your music and these two Song embody that clear for me.
However, I also believe that you can be a happy man and make yet dark music.
