"Cold and inhuman": Contrary to Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Contrary to Behring Breivik, the man who has confessed two Amokläufe, in which 77 people were killed in this summer in Norway, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" Kämpfer.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple Knight of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations that support hate ideologies and because multiculturalism is being supported."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judges Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he "Breivik, did not want to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to Breivik, mitbrachte a pre-written speech, permission to turn at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that another 12 weeks retains the police for Breivik in custody, four weeks he has no access to the media, he said that the authorities will monitor all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to see Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All participated with the aim that everything comes down to a wegschließen.
"I thought he cold and inhuman acts," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was embarrassing, but for me it goes a little bit after I have seen the suspect and heard."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and helped throughout the hearing calmly and professionally. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered the building and left again.
In spite of Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" Bewegung, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks on 22 July was apparently the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radical.
But that facilitates automatically the heartache and the confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish that he looked like a monster, but that does not do it," the family of a victim said.
"It would be so much easier if he would do it."
