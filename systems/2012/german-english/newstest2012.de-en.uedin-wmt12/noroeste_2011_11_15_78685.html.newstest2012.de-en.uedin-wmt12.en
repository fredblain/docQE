Debt for construction
Those in the programmes Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios públicos and 3x1 planned social works for migrants risk being completed due to lack of funds or not only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the municipal authority for social development, said that, although the works program are already advanced, they are now in danger, because the central government its fair share of funding for the three programs has not paid 11 million peso.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes was almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell on the state, and until now have only the Federación and the community contributed to the construction funding, and a delay of Baubeendigung was to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year end, they have given us a penny, and that, even though they are already in the July part would have to pay," he said. "So as not to be too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are well advanced, but we need the money."
He stressed that the state was not under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla met its commitments, and the community at the start, whose government has had to take a loan of 7 million, which would be equivalent to the amount that the central government must have been.
"That was left us in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went further and this year we had to raise the money that had not had the state to participate in these programmes," he led.
Even if the state authorities were obliged to release these funds, he commented that was asked the minister for administration and finance, to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding share as quickly as possible.
"Almost 12 million must play them, and although the year is finished, they have given us a penny."
