The scandal by Zürisee bank
The bizarre bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was in the financial crisis almost broke, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next.
Now it is to send a German.
It had not Axel Weber certainly thought.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was leaked in July that he stand 2013 almost as spectacular new job: Management Council President of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly praised Switzerland because of its beauty and the UBS over their newly acquired solidity and was not friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.
A dealer of UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and Been gambling found around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS's board chief Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted banker, had to go.
The administration of President of the Council since UBS is also a sickly - and all ask: When will finally Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber must advise the bank by February 2012.
And he takes over the administration Council seat in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber that will be hard.
He is not a banker, economics professor and central bankers and would have an apprenticeship period had certainly needs.
At a stroke, he will take over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just demonstrated once again that they have long deserved the title of "biggest scandal bank of Europe."
Because the UBS is huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, the once so proud Swiss bank is spared.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss Vermögensverwalters had combined it with ambitious targets: They wanted to be in the investment banking, a very large number.
The UBS managed $1.6 trillion in 2007, with high-net-worth clients more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was advanced as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world.
This made impression.
The former banker and later longstanding banking professor in Zurich Hans Audit tells: "My students, I have portrayed the UBS at the time as a model of good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How I could only be wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, was apparently the first time that something went wrong in the UBS properly.
The middle of the year came head Peter Wuffli surprisingly, which by then was regarded as a highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.
A few months later, you guessed why he was gone.
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found themselves with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder, the UBS announced a capital increase amounting to say and write 13 billion francs.
They found real investors, however, on which many had bodied until shortly before the nose: A intransparenten Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was gloss over the fact that it was not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, management Council President Marcel Ospel, 2006, still the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster: The UBS was given their investments in the financial crisis before the collapse, and had to be rescued by the state followed.
The National Bank has bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled assets, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole country was shocked - because they observed how dramatically it is for a small country, when it plays host to such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times as large as the performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banks researchers audit says.
The first disaster, the second joined.
Just a few months after the UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to issue the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from this business with Strafaufschlag.
The UBS openly confessed more or less to have helped in the tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that has always been their capital in the competition for wealthy clients: The aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of head and management Council President.
And the exodus of clients' money.
The bank had lost its credibility within a few months in two key portfolios: By the false speculation in investment banking and asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it was once a somewhat more, just as we believed that the UBS will get it again, since these unfortunate traders follows-history: An individual trader Been gambling found 1.7 billion euros before the bank notes that something is going wrong.
And it will obviously: With the risk management in the investment banking it works out.
"With the case of Adoboli you have to conclude that the risk control has changed too little," Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor at the University of Zurich bank Institute says.
The financial management of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."
It was just the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time to be the guardian of the great assets of the world: Not too many risks to ensure security for money - was also collapse across the Alpine republic of the world.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich nor fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road leading from the main railway station from directly to the Zürichsee, which is flanked by the schneebedeckten summits of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere like Tiffany's is here between Swiss tradition shops like the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks stay here: From the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks like Julius bear.
The reception hall of the UBS one enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside are marble disguised the walls, thick leather chair, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "Safe."
The UBS knows what the customer is here: Security.
This idea of Swiss Bank have ousted two Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name, he would rather not read in the newspaper, finally, he is, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big business.
The UBS had become far too big, he finds, especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say.
"And if they have adapted long the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that the UBS changed, it cost only high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has in the subprime jungle so much money lost as the Swiss large bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday's ruling coalition of the small country of seven million, the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros approved the politicians to save the big one standing before the bankruptcy.
How did it happen?
Talks with Swiss bankers, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks arrayed on a huge corporation.
There was a bank that was too big for the merger for the small Swiss - and increasingly grew.
Yet the two different precursor to complement-banks of UBS helped: A rich, but slept through bank with the focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the globalised investment bankers were favourable to a lot of money with which they could be a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS, Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, company chief of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team," says banks researchers Hans audit.
"Wuffli, high intellectuals, modest, who knows a great deal of models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut person who has worked up the bank lesson by high."
But Ospel have relied on the closure on Wuffli.
And Wuffli have probably made at the end of a crucial mistake: "He thought his models are the reality," says auditions.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
Was an excess is clear: In the case.
Staff of the UBS point clearly to the offending executives-meetings at which company chief Wuffli was always the same slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the league tables, the rankings, which documented the success of the banks that time.
Then, the UBS wanted, the top.
Some steps were already have kept her.
In the foreign exchange business and the securities they played with the top.
Corporate advisers who have been charged, however, stressed a weakness: International interest in the business, in which bankers language "surprise fixed income there is" a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS into an adventure that they cost almost the existence went.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a before her established hedge funds invested in U.S. subprime assets.
So it became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage lending packaged and far reaching, but also even risks prevailed.
Still, when other banks long sought the exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS, has bought there," banking expert audit says.
As the euphoria of large, so deep.
A manager had to go after another, as the trials tested clean up more difficult than had been thought.
Post in the UBS became the Schleudersitz and are still shaky.
Anyone who leads the major bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, who have lost all obvious business models.
Banks researchers audit already has an idea: Stop the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank will (still) not go.
But the investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti intends to present to the world its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution, when the bank itself surprisingly of predecessor Grübel separated.
Meanwhile, he has prevailed: He should permanently lead the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to the state in the mid-1990s trim.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
That will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What it wants to make money?
These are the questions that arise Axel Weber safe now.
Publicly he says only that he will seek with his wife, once an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
