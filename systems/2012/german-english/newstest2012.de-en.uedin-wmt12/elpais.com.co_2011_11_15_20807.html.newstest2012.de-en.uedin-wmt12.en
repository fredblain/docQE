What was missing the candidate del Valle, to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that played out that Melina Ramírez Serna not received the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca came empty in the award of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, had to be content with Melina Ramírez Serna to stand on the winners podium to ask a silver crown and the bond, which will allow it to be seen as new Miss Colombia.
With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico Zeder took the crown and that in itself, it's already comes to 14 Miss title and Melina Bellini Region to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had kept the crown almost in the hands, on the proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia) Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008.
The big question facing many today, is: What was missing?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a big favourite, who had shown in every showing that they had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, but not in vain, she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Joly of vogue, title, which had also received the beauty of King inside Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took the crown of Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor as crucial for the decision of the jury, the First Miss to appoint them, is that they are the answer to the question, "What book has influenced you most and why?" Her of Martín Gómez Murillo of Carreta Literaria Leamos asked, was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of civilisation, ultimately, I believe that the book for my childhood coined the most, 'the little prince' is a very deep book.
At the moment I read 'guilt and atonement. "It is a book of universal culture that we should read all. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, that is' passions'.
A response that did not like, firstly because of the concept of 'civilized' and secondly, because they had not said specifically how each of her called the book had influenced them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony Melina, quiet and happy with the result to be declared: "The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all the people: Please read a bit of 'The small Prince. "It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle burn.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the bevorzugte who had received all Beifälle pockets and in the run-up to all prices had made (catering-competition Oster, audience vote on the best handgeschneiderte suit and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously, what the Queen stresste who could not therefore shine on the stage."
And it noted that in its first presentation in bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony.
Although it appeared both safe, but it lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico were on display.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "as en casa" on Channel RCN said that the fact that Melina to Miss was crowned, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, after all, is not Queen."
Moreover, Valle was at the end of the press from the road - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that the Valle Jurie about their interest could not convince the social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National beauty contest.
There must be a reason, said that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty, they sought a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the physical and focus on the social sense, that she had worked before the participation in the competition in projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, which it said her in the stomach area had sinned. But that is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there would be better, "but to say their problem with the fibrosis on gut, which for me was hardly say honestly expressed their marks on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos is of the magazine Cromos believe the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca had the surgery, which they had undergone.
"The operations are: OK, but Valle should not be knew how they make it right.
Her body has never been their strong point, and this point had to pay them. "
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National beauty contest, arose after the appearance in the bathing suit a cruel prediction that should be true in the night. It was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina had been a consolation prize to make them do not enjoy the crown.
Regardless of whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina now takes up its rule year, although not as Queen, but to represent as Princess, a position which gives her the opportunity to appoint the National beauty contest Colombia in one of the international competitions.
However, they will go down as one of the queens, who had escaped despite their overwhelming reappearance of Cartagena the crown, in history.
