The world of the Republican presidential candidates gemäβ
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
A crisis weakened America could lead a complex world with simple, not to say: Stupid ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression.
For several days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters are announcing their thundering declarations and statements regarding the Auβenpolitik, repeatedly traditional republikanischem focus.
On China, Iran and the Israel fall-aid - often reinforced in any way - slogans.
On the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest rate in the Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - to accuse leading issue in an America that entire industries to Asia is through the brain irritated at Äuβerste.
Stupid gone, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and sole candidate, a mature vision of Auβenpolitik seems to have, almost the emotions about his performance, the air schmeichelnden way.
He had called for a solid, but constructive conversation exchange with Beijing (also the current position of Obama's).
But Huntsman will not be met, because he has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's clone
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if the sanctions should the Stoppung the nuclear program fail.
"If I am elected, I Iran put an end to stop," he had claimed.
"Obama will re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has remained to be Auβerdem Israel promised increased military aid and accused Obama, this partner with commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, second-highest platzierter candidate, for its part, is a shameful acts ignorance on display.
He recently called in the Chinese military threat against giving because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear power" - and the fact auβer eight seemed to be that China since 1964 in possession of military nuclear-weapons.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and military strikes against Iran, äuβert turn to be prepared to take the American army against drug cartels in Mexico in service.
Obama's 2009 banning use of Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also advocated by Cain, Perry and Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far from John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current Presidency counterparties, Reagan had also simple ideas and won despite all this, the Cold War.
They call that Obama is also selbstein amateur and water into his wine had to listen to what the issue concerned counter.
They rightly insist on the failure of his simplistic Zwiegespräches with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also gave him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility 'approach, however, is not quite so.
The population estimates the positive assessment of the National Security under Obama, Bin Laden has eliminated.
Since the Iraq, it is wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised adequate, arguing that America should be rebuilt economically to resurrect his leadership to life.
