Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health legislation, the court case takes
On the day when the Supreme Court puts behind closed doors to discuss the political part end question will be whether to hear an appeal against the health legislation by President Obama, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas took part in a dinner that was gesponsort of the services that will take the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases handled was a complaint who have collected 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care, which decided last year by Congress, a law that has been in the conservative activists everywhere in the United States for the slogan.
The judges agreed with the hearing. Indeed, a 5 1 / 2-hour in March expected bases discussion that will probably be the result likely to boost the presidential campaign in 2012, which will be given at the time, in which the court ruling, in full swing.
The lawyer, who will stand trial and claim that is to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a veteran group that is dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which the law challenge.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the process is hugely involved.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service had, among other things, Mitch McConnell, America's the group leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health care reform
The guests of the Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges attend events of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, free judges from the code of conduct to govern the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were to fall, they would be under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in beneficial initiatives law near and other organizations, and the judges must not be a spokesman, guest of honor or according to programme a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas on two of the case in related departments and ranged from a company with a massive financial interest in this to alert morality-and-government activists.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court consider themselves to the same rules that apply to all other federal judge Bob Edgar, president of Common said," cause-, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trial at the court."
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say that they too would court matter easily with groups based on the agenda as the federalist society mix, for example.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
However, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was state attorney general under the Obama Administration, when the first law disputes came in the first instance trial.
Their critics pressed Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias because she had committed too much in the defense of the law, to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
