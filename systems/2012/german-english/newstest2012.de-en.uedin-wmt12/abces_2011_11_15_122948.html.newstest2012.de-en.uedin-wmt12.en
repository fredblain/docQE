Japan after the earthquake, reborn
The GDP is growing by 1.5%, thanks to the domestic consumption and the spiral of a free fall from the beginning of March ends
Since last March, the Japanese economy was paralyzed, which had seen still in the recovery after the devastating earthquake, which empties into a nuclear crisis, and was the worst disaster that Japan the Second World War.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems despite the difficult global economic situation to weaken.
After three quarters of fall, the claims of the gross domestic product from July to September served to finally close this chapter, GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% on the year hochgerechnete quota.
The measured value in the second quarter of the financial year in Japan in March 2012 begins - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can partly be explained by the sale of machines for the rebuilding of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated areas.
Indeed, the companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the drop of 0.9% for investments that have been recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of relentless increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively from Keynesian aligned yourself using the crisis to build infrastructure or build new ones.
Japan is particularly woken up, thanks to the development of the domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
These variable rose by 1%, from the increased spending on cars, travel and leisure activities took place.
The stigma of yen
Tokyo has entrusted to the domestic market after the yen, the Japanese currency - rests in one of the "haven currencies" of investors who are fleeing the debt crisis in the eurozone and the dire predictions for the U.S.A., a privilege that like a tombstone in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a tougher currency products are more expensive abroad, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of the major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, led their weak business results from July to September on the listing of the yen.
While the markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government remains vigilant Yoshihiko Noda.
"We must be very careful with the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand, and the rapid appreciation of the yen," the Secretary of State for economic policy, Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
The prospects are really not very aufheiternd.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states would have been clearer signs in September for a slowdown of economic development.
The indicator, which is ahead of the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the brakes would be among the largest economic powers moved.
Because he fell by four-tenths to release 100,4 points compared to the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone is even below the average value, which is 100, after it has fallen by eight-tenths of 99,13 points.
