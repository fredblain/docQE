Sister of Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo supported by the PRI in the race for governor posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday, dealers had influenced the race in favor of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results Fausto Vallejo won by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the election process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They asked threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... you have filled polling booths, built barricades... and people to vote for the PRI []."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon only seems to have beaten barely who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, the candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, PRD, currently the acting governor, came in at number three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left leadership for the presidential election in 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long dominated by drug cartels, which on marijuana, heroin and amphetamines have specialised.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and Michoacan, he has chosen to launch in December 2006, a military-led offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN-mayor was killed a week before the election, during a public meeting for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
A victory for the PRI strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race probably is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory makes us look boldly into the next year."
