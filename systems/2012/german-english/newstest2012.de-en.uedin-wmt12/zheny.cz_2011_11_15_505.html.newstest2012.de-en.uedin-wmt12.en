The worst female vice whens compromises: What was that about you?
When one asks the men to give some typical female vice when compromises, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves.
Dear women, you see in the following lines back where we review a few bad habits that the men's blood in the veins Wallen?
Shopping is looking
Accuses them of their come to be shopping addicts?
You must buy a conflict at least a week?
Go to shop, and it must also be in action a bit more?
It is in your case, probably really a weakness.
Some women are aware of this and at least try to keep their shopping mood reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, the woman from thinks it has to been dawdling in search of a good seated upper clothing only as a clothes shop and try not equally all (in all sorts of Farbkombinationen) in the booth?
Even if the shopping for most women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.
But they are considering how often they said her husband - you just prefer to stick out there...
Permanent discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have to decline at least five kilos - should I start to make to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
They know that somehow?
Yes?.
Then you probably belong to the women who are downright obsessed, as they look.
This does not mean long, that you should take, but many men have an allergic reaction out if their wife whinges constantly about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always unvertr√§glicher.
Order and cleanliness in first
It is a fight against windmills.
Cleaning windows, tiles and dust sweep, the basin scheuern - and it at least twice a week.
You rant with her partner, because he once again trampled with dirty shoes on the clean tiles, telling you the children, because the very gescheuerte Waschbecken is again rotten and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has already fingerprints, where the Polieren so much trouble?
If you are under this kind of "Devianz 'suffering, you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life are not in the first place.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately hurt the mutual relations and especially the calm in the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty Turnhosen coming into the laundry basket."
"You want to attract the old socks really tomorrow again?"
"A towel casts a watery not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that that will make him the Palme.
Clearly this is not meant bad, they want but only that everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women did not need to possibly meckern so much.
Novelty gossip and
Some women applaud and came to Chen since getuschelt behind the backs or even slandered or forging alliances.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like by hecheln such issues, for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Well, each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and novelty at camp.
Hand on heart - that is probably all women.
But that is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, who despise probably everyone around them, and which are especially for women collective a significant risk.
