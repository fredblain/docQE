The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate looms.
Almost five months, the Czech football has no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known risks.
Until now, there is still no agreement, which is to be elected under election rules.
And without that, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek resigned from his post, and he asked his colleagues in the departure of them had to agree and to find a strong personality, which could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek the old squabbles between the two Association Chambers broke out again, which could not agree on a joint candidate.
This was clear on 16 September, when the new president should be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come free of charge to people house in Prague quarter Smíchov, because the negotiations produced no result, and it was not only the election itself.
You could not even agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection, only the statutory representatives or with a power-funded officials.
In this single point it reached agreement, at least in part, including the recommendation of the institute also contributed to state and right, whose opinion was a representation at full power base is not allowed.
The dispute over the election rules, however, continue to persist.
The Executive Committee did not provide more clarity on the matter, ordinary in its meetings, whether in principle is extraordinary - or anything else on the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a couple of times - the worst point remained the same.
The question is: What should we do in the third round to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a different model must be found," noted Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR, who represents in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model in the third round of the triumphs candidate who receives expressed as the greater support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the triumphs candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner in this prozentuellen vote count receives at least a two-thirds majority.
"The two first heat, IFE AT ALL have no sense that this mode the whole bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side that it would be best not tweaking the election rules, but according to choose valid statutes.
It is also surprisingly Tomáš Paclík, even if emerging that the statutory election rules by all candidates is probably best Pelta.
"It is my wish that is elected largely after the statute."
"To be conceived in order for any nonsensical ersatz variants, as in the last general meeting the owner said," (the club) Victoria Plzeň, who is standing for the first time in his opinions and to neo-especially Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk, and he believes that the candidates will work together in the future in a constructive manner.
"The possible qualification for the national team would help the football-Euro today sure to calm the passions."
"If the football is only on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," the official from Jablonec who by all three Adepten and this is the greatest experience at both professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more cautious.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts trying to fudge the rules for their own purposes". "
"That is why a new deadlock in the general meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope that common sense prevails," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides is not.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be complete until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice should fly, among other things, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction even as it sought urgently for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee, but still at the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level is then crucial, on which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education had the divided parties within the biggest sports associations of the country like to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: State handouts, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of ČSTV, which will lead the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.
Paclík goes in the fight for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers could account for the extraordinary general meeting would be a strong candidate, who met) all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of Czech Republic (FAČR, he would not have allowed at all in the fight for the lead.
"If there was a good candidate, then I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it failed to find such a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, is to prevent so that the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta reached to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that he does if he wins the role of chairman to put only one year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to hear a seen top manager who is not involved in the football too much.
"With some eligible people I have spoken personally."
"Only to believe that some people have told me that they were not currently with the Czech football identify.
"Such views would have liked to change," he quoted.
Most of all, supposedly the link Pelta bothers to influence Paclík 's Pilsner district with the chairman of the Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which goes behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of chairman.
"In his victory today's condition would einkonserviert and the Czech football progress were not at all."
"The support by Berbr, a cleverem businessman, would get the football twice badly," Paclík stressed.
Here he plays out that Pelta's name recently fell in connection with phone taps to identify in a corruption affair, however, Pelta emerged with impunity.
"I do not know what should bring a victory of prestige Pelta which (tsch) football."
"And how would we be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," řekl Paclík, who sees his former saying, 'he would sell the acquired London's Pilsner if Pelta will chair, "but rather more calmly said.
Paclík should prevail in the Thursday election that he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
As another candidate thinks - Rajchl, the Paclík had supported before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I putting my nose but not in matters which I understand nothing," said Paclík, who had caused a stir in September for that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík even claimed that he felt up to the role of the association chairmen.
And holding up his skills in the direction of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to something in the football environment and to change to a degree of cultivation of this."
"In order to curb the influence of certain interest groups that tend to disciplinary and appeal commissions to influence what deteriorates until sickening situations," Paclík led, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example to the Sparta-chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, he would see the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic-Committee, through which it flows would lobbyieren among political leaders for more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"That is one of the key things that should address the new chairman."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, declare as the political parties, I understand their argument, they must also say clearly where the money is," he said.
His link to the Pilsner Paclík club is not a handicap, although he stresses itself, the chairman of the FAČR "bipartisan" be.
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"It is my opinion but not much sense to transfer my shares in the club Pilsner hypocritical for a third person to to return to one and a half years," Paclík made clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, to rule out a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates promised for the Vorsitzendenamt: Miroslav Pelta, he will make his choice in the event that the FAČR gets new place statutes that exclude in future disputes over the election rules from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September, he wants to concentrate on his election to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided only at the last moment to take part in the election before the last general meeting and to defend his ideas about the running of football and present in a broader context was help him the two-month break.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is headed by someone, the man who is associated mainly with the Jablonecer club, which acted but also many years in Sparta and the Executive Committee says.
That is also why he believes that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election is responsible for the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, as it had adopted all were approved at the shareholders' meeting in June statutes that were not so perfect.
If they would not have allowed different interpretations we had, from September already had a chairman, "Pelta said.
The revision of the main document of the citizens association he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I become president, I suppose me personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be" Pelta claims.
In addition, he does not try to differentiate themselves against his opponents.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl he recognises because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also attacked Tomáš Paclík no longer, which in turn left no dry thread of Pelta.
In football, he moves for over a year and can point to some successes. "
"His attacks were unworthy and many people were shocked by his electoral campaign."
"So many people have doubts about his true character," Pelta have addressed his opponent, which probably remain faithful to his proclamation, which he said in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And they should be the hallmark of Czech football.
"I would also to try to end all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the echoes of the corruption scandal last year."
"Shortly afterwards I would throw myself to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the entire football," said the candidate sechsundvierzigjährige ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival will mean to the head of the Czech football no human cleansing.
"I would like to make once familiar with the work of content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov where nervousness exists because of the long anarchy moved.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk are not in vain.
"If really should be the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come across it."
"Football needs credibility and who wins it only when he finally has a new Leader Pelta remains two days" before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the general meeting on Thursday, the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, so many people would supposedly feeding frenzy in the Association's whim.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, will start to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
He also promised to solve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to put more money into the football and to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, down to the performance of the youth football. "
"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone, 'said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football is moving forward in every segment with miles steps. "
Many would delight not precisely because they would have to, rather than just the work of others, now really begin to work hard, "he added.
Because of the tense atmosphere in the football movement to stand no longer have contemplated.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who throw me not constantly thwarted and ask any step that I am in question," he said as an explanation of why he had hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others."
"This is confidence that we must not waste," he said.
Allegedly motivates him to continue to welcome the work he has started in Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I simply do not want to throw away now."
"It started in processes that are probably only in a few years, and I would be reluctant to see that they are stopp someone," he said, and hereby expresses his concerns that could be the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected to return the situation to the times in Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that is not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, people who make football so are especially were that he would be there only for exclusivity."
I can reproach probably some things, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I like football for everyone, because it is all well and not just the selected" Rajchl said.
He also rejects the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether it should split the league into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners will then each in the first league."
"It might not happen that today only three Moravian clubs playing in the league, which is especially for the young players in Moravia a problem," says Rajchl.
Because the head of Pilsner has now joined the club Tomáš Paclík struggle for the role of chairman, Rajchl do not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which has been elected to its vice-chairman and now that clear successes are behind me recognizes" Rajchl, which sees the saving of tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts that agreement of TV contracts and negotiations with the lottery law as his success led.
On the other hand, it is partly the fault that the association does not in a single direction.
While he of Pelta says, "he was disqualified from the outset to help the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate who have something to offer the football.
"No one can question that he has done in Pilsen in just a year's excellent work."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the staff in the commissions would not change he apparently fundamentally."
He would not want things certainly hinbiegen in his favor, "Rajchl judges on his rivals.
