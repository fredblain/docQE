Immigration burden or opportunity is for the economy?
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised from many corners - overwhelmed by police, judicial and administrative bodies subordinated the figures due to a policy of reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had call themselves.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students had shaped by administrative side the weeks look, the Interior Minister had passing (see Libération of 23 May) announced that France "no talent, bricklayers or waiter from abroad was necessary."
But this policy has been analysed rarely from the economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.
From the right side of the tone was echoed by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that 900 000 unemployed, including particularly about 2 million should include "workforce, no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not the whole of poverty in the world."
The only difference in the level of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of invasion of the national land by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 from both the right and the left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the extent of Groβzügigkeit, it is willing to admit the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme to banalities, who point out that partnership development will permit it to solve our "immigration."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can influence the elections; but it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book illustrate that the latest findings on the immigration summarises (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
The immigration would limit the growth sap and damage the labour market situation.
The fears over the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace the local workforce, particularly the less skilled, by exercised pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that the immigrants in truth are complementary as much as the local wage workers as they exercise schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors that are unausgelastet job technically.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors which these attract little domestic wage workers, the higher quality among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors where the training is not aligned with the offer.
Positive effect pay
As a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesisten, so does this complementarity between locals and migrants a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic employment situation.
Giovanni peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants are disabled person leads a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 percent and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the immigrants sponsored by the diversity of ideas is conducive to the creation and growth (high proportion eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel laureates, Google, Intel, micropayments, eBay, Yahoo, and were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to the social welfare net, in the European countries, on average, around in a 1% of the overall budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that an aged 30 years after Germany einwandernde person brings the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of the 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate to the lack of average points "with the teeth."
These aforementioned teeth that should deter the immigrants, reached exactly the opposite effect.
