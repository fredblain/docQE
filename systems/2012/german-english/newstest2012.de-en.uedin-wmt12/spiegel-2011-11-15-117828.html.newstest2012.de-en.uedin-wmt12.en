Europe's most beautiful pools
The blues leap
Julia Stanek of
In Planschbecken Ufo-optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, can experience with a shock - and after a city tour or migrate the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.
A book shows where wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went over the past one and a half years on a research trip, her bathing suit was not allowed to miss one in their luggage:.
Rücklings prone on the water, they looked into high art fully-developed domes, they sponge marble-Putten, who waited in the basin edge on them, and was on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
She liked a bath, they took it in great haste note in their book values - and know details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools are being architecture historian Meder in this way - and bathing pleasures ": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest," hardcore concrete buildings, it is now in her recently published book "in the Taunus region near Frankfurt.
They led by 13 countries of their "trip to the most remarkable bathrooms in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and at a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture-Enthusiastin.
With sport, they do not have much on hat, Meder said - only in water that is different.
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell must resign, while Jogger breathe the smell of deceptive Fichtenwäldern or can listen merry Vogelgezwitscher in the park.
"I have asked me one day, why swimming pools are always so ugly," says the Meder live in Vienna.
"So I started to collect fine baths."
Architecture rising water levels doubles
Geplätscher jump in the pool and sauna-essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the senses are served, Meder.
And if the builders have had trouble Schwimmhallen can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a foot soil has a rising water levels in bathrooms."
"It is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."
Everything blend doubles: High vault, colorful Kacheln, leap out.
The band kleinformatige picture "bathing pleasures" gives at 190 sides know value on the architectural and cultural history of historic wellness-havens - but especially appetite for a leap in the blues.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pooling Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent spas like the 100-year-old Széchenyi-bad in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Toruń, whose basin are filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a bottle shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many firing Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: While the Zurich Dachbad has the whole city in the eye can look you in the outdoor pool of Bads in St Anton on schneebedeckten Arlberg - and, in Dampfbad there is a window from which they can monitor the activity on the skiing-runway.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pooling design from expects bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
For three open parings dampft sticking it in winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals into the sky.
The Black Forest Alhambra
Not in any swimming pool of the pool-Sammlerin Meder rose the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many for Toruń smell of sulphur in Árpád-bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong for fuel oil, which is believed to have landed in a bad health.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen salvation water that is almost black and its silt is one-soaked to the skin, once you are sliding themselves into the pool - a wellness-experience of the particular kind.
In one place Iris Meder was disappointed in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however: When they wanted to visit the Frei- and sun in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a abgesperrtes terrain.
The 1902-designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic bath was now closed.
When Meder verwitterten looked through the windows of the red-white-yellow youth style-building, they saw weeds between the tiles has grown.
One, on the other hand, has countered the decline in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palais thermal bath in Wildbad.
Three construction schedules this bath has already behind them; you can discover not only neoromanische elements that come from days of its establishment in the year 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added at 1900.
Since the thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palais is the favourite thermal bath of pooling knowledge Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement to merge so different Baustile at such a great unity," Meder said.
In such a palace in the Tauchgang Thermalpool seems only a sideshow.
