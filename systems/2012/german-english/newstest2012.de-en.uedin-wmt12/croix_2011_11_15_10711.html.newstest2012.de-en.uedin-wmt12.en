Why the unemployment rate for disabled employee will spending Hi OR hers whole remains at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are on finding a job.
Today, "the 15th week of work begins for the disabled."
Despite a determined public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice as high as the average average: 19% Arbeitlosigkeit contrary to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?.
"No, Éric Blanchet, Director-General of the association stresses adaptation, which targets the" week of work for the disabled. "
"The inside of 15 years are considerable progress."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a huge amount to do."
It must be said, however, that persist for the unemployed disabled still many obstacles before they get a job.
More often, it affects the elderly: 37%) are older than 50 years (17% on average.
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with qualifications.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also widespread: 53% of the disabled, compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that a new work a rose, and the "core of the problem form," Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains the underlying implication, the mentalities, certainly, but developed slowly.
A in April by the Association of IMS-entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study was that the surveyed managers have "a weak knowledge level on the disabled," the "over-represented" was "from people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually weak by."
Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
"We are now at the 3%," Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is charged with recovering contributions from companies that flout the law reports.
The proof: The number "fees zahlender" plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011 reduced, zahlenmäβig of 59.000 on 46 000 (and of 606 at 480 million euros).
"The Act of 2005, which provides for increased contributions created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc said."
"But this improvement is also a real insight, particularly the groβen firms groups."
According to the Ministry of Labor employ only 59% of plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 workers against 82%.
