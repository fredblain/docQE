Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe connects directly with Russia, was put in operation.
It is to supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to mark the event with pomp and ceremony.
About 500 directors, including four leaders, last Tuesday have participated in the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung Feinschmeckerbuffet and at the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the sea level directly with each other.
The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have turned a symbolic way along the helm of Ventils, which transports Russian gas to Western European network.
With the new pipeline additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year are to be delivered by a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length, which links the region of Saint Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, according to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which allowed a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of France's total consumption - is to be completed at the end of 2012.
And it is already hinting the possibility of building a third transmission route for themselves.
Gazprom point for the timely and accurate completion of this huge building are an important element acts like a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic States sharply disputed.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany and to avoid any lines running through third countries (Poland and Ukraine) on the continent.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: For them, it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close down the access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not spared from back to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German and tables pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive äuβerst.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
But this at the expense of an enfeebled European energy, because the project has created a rift between West and East European.
Russia has run it brought in almost five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and their gas running out to enforce.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing to what extent the groβen gas contracts are also of political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of Lubmin number of Gazprom managers about the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter, which they should protect against Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in about 200 metres depth.
In its construction from the Second World War previous minefields had to be sidestepped.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream stated.
Auβerdem had increased Maβnahmen for the Protection of fauna and flora.
The leadership is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffeltürme, who is suspended over the entire length by nothing, either through outlets or maintenance stations.
A Kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project developers have held back from as the Swedes were not eager to see a Russian state company settle on permanent way to level their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close down the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak in the pipeline that the gas escape into the air.
This case is seen by designers as little, however, probably because the Schweiβnähte was estimated at a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.
The state control of the gas pipeline will ensure both from an underwater-robot, which circulates on external controlled surveillance purposes by a seagoing vessels from being, as well as by a device inside the gas pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and move through the gas pressure.
After three full days of transport by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device on his arrival provides detailed information on possible deformations such of metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for 50 years without having to undergo the slightest repair.
The Gaszirkulation is guaranteed simply by pressure.
It is $200 cash at Zutritts-, 100 cash at the exit point.
Five companies have united on the implementation of this project their forces.
The leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The German companies E. on and BASF are here (ever) attached to 15.5%, as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez) (depending on 9%.
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has also rented out the entire capacity of this society Gastransportes at renewing Twenty-year-contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how could plunge large is the real animals transported gas volumes," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus was guaranteed to 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the total investment was 240 million.
The minority shareholders are gewiβ, however, to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is on a sandy, with jaws forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metres high outlets form the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the material gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday this terminal will be supplied with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour verstreichende.
At full capacity, it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
