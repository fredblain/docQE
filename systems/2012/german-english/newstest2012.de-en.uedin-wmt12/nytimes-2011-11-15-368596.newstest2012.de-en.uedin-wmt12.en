One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.
On 14 October officials wanted to clear the park, but were being transformed into back then, when hundreds of protesters came together after they had learned from these plans.
Officials of various police units were involved in the operation on Tuesday, including use of commandos from around the city, hundreds of mobile officials, which are typically used in high-crime neighborhoods.
