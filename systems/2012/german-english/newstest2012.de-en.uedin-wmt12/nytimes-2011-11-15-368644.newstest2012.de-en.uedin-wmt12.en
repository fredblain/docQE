Mass slaughter on a personal level
Einfühlsam and generous Peter Englunds begins new book "beauty and horror, a history of the First World War, told in nineteen beings" with a long list of players who is one to heart.
Here is a piece of advice, as it could be: Do you this side cautiously and you make them on your read sign.
You will get to know these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative very well, and these players will have as your GPS function, deprived of a beacon in those few moments where you lost as Englunds men and women in the fog of war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he describes not incorrect as "a work of the anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, reckless reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less men and women on both sides of the war along inconspicuous, of schoolgirls and Botanikern up to mountaineers, doctors, hospital car drivers and clerks.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some are crazy about prisoners of war, loss of limb, or die.
Each of these lives to have flared up like the Votivkerzen in a church, some added to lapse over others.
Book Englunds deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that the First World War was only the devastating war position on the West Front.
"Beauty and horror" relocating with experts view on other war show venues: The Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book bees baskets, one celebrates Christmas fall under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.
This is almost from the start, a very moving book.
The war is swamping the lives of these people as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smell, after Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and hear cannons fire in the distance. Stand or take the flight?
Who comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being waged at all.
"Lack of facts," Englund notes, "were aufgemöbelt with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were taken mainly memories, letters and other previously published material.
Their life stories can be frighteningly or simple, but they are very alive in the Englunds in details possessed accumulations of small moments.
Many of them act of shortages and oneself recourse.
In the history of a German Schulmädchens he tells: 'Replacement, everywhere substitute. "
"Substitute coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper associations, wooden buttons."
He tells more of the substitute Essen in Germany.
He describes "meat, which was made from large compressed piece of rice and cooked in Hammelfett (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes that were besohlt with wood was."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitute funds that were permitted in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute resources."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "We feel that this is in spite of what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, pretending that means such a facade of civilisation and when there were no barbarism behind their own strengthened and team of sophisticated shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he probably die and no one of them will take notice or care about.
"If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves growing gap one would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is so terrible as "a convicted man, who was hanged in secret."
Other observations act of the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror.
"The dispute was increasingly becoming an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He catches the arrival of what he calls "a new species in Bestiarium of the young century": "The eloquent and ideologically committed slaughtered mass murderer in the yardstick that, while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivoles behavior as heroic acts.
Englund discusses the soldiers who tried actively being infected with a prostitute with a venereal disease to escape the front service.
"The grotesque manifestation of this can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals to come in the hope, to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rub it in the eye, which meant that they were the rest of their lives blind."
This translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek and yet intrusiveness and adapts perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war unleashed "unique way uncontrollable forces: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
The people are starting to wonder why their leaders bring them the fighting.
The best books about the First World War were predominantly falsified as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Gallery memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In the West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.
In Englunds band enters an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, of which I have ever read in a Sachbuch.
I admit it no longer.
But it is as he would have us with his book this side with the players before the nose weggeschnappt and with a match set.
