The military is the growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 men and women for intervention are not charged in a rape before the military court.
It does not happen, hundreds of prosecutor are ready for the next hearing.
Me Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008, and they returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from the dinner with a friend when they met on a male colleague, who wore a 12er Pack beer.
He asked them whether he will accompany them for a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went to," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin brushed aside their concerns.
I thought: 'No, he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I would have listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they were taken to Lymans Zimmer, the man was behind it, they put down and they raped, it claims.
This week, decided on 18 November, waiting Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, whether a lawsuit they have filed against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but rose in the following months to 28: 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were being raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify it, to condemn or to put a proper jurisdiction after the alleged attack available.
Burke says she follow the top military leadership, because the problem will start there.
"The military is built hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke says also be that it has contacted since February nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all the plaintiffs of their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many other complaints so that the pressure to maintain.
The team of defence for the Defense Ministry, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit.
The files of the court, the Newsweek, to lead the defense in depth, primarily that the military cannot be accused of current or former soldiers for violations that have occurred in the armed forces.
Because of a law by the Supreme Court from the 1950, known as the Feres Doctrine, the government will not be liable for injuries, inflicted on active duty troops.
"The alleged damage during the course of the plaintiffs," states the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to service in the fight, the distinction only on behalf of lies: Modern wars have seldom clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: Between these two wars 150 soldiers, two-thirds of them died in the fighting.
It is time that the military will be modernised, Burke says.
And she is not alone in their struggle: Except its three other lawsuits are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies, because of alleged promotion of women hostile atmosphere.
Regardless of the non-governmental Vietnam Veterans of America, collects a complaint against the military in which one focused on the diagnosis "personality disorder" that rape victims were given to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, the group submitted a complaint against the Veterans Administration (dt.: Management of war veterans a), in which she did her discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who claimed to have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws was produced independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.
2010 were under the Sexual assault Prevention and Response Office (dt.: Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) Department of Defense 3.158 sexual abuses.
But most abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account this number around 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, is also examining the prosecution rates: 2010 came 20 percent of reported cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In the Lymans case she reported the alleged rape of the police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says she was asked 11 times, recounting the details of her rape of a large number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape SET and the blood of her aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, during this hearing, she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend.
Six people from said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says.
"I thought that would use the labour pains. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that I said when I came out again to my commander: This was not his procedure, and that was my procedure."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, who admonished ultimately a personality disorder and they declared incapable of service.
In January 2010, she was discharged honorably, so that they receive no support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other plaintiffs have tabled proceeds, is pure speculation, John Turley, a professor of law from says to the George Washington University Law School.
Nonetheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised since it was first put in question.
I am time life a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military lags behind a decade, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, which brings a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it is important for them that they try it."
These things will only change to fight if good people are ready.
If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs will start for future cases.
"We will fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, which is always the first.
