The threat is palpable
After the discovery of "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media question the German law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which auflebe now.
The murders of eight Turkish and Greek businessmen in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.
This news will react in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German-Türken sweeps a long totgeglaubtes specter: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and at Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks.
That there is in Germany xenophobia, however, was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network revealed to be uncovered but proportions, whose dimension is still far from clear.
"The bloody ideology lives back on?" The headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk. "
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators should have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities may be involved in the extreme right-wing swamp.
Germany's Turkish community reacted calmly: They reminded at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In lively colors coexistence was orchestrated - as a history of success.
As a slap in the face is the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift for the 50th" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," speaking behind the murder series.
The German edition of 'Hürriyet' will not take it to consider these ideas link.
"It starts to smell," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stresses that people have been murdered, paying the taxes and would have done with their work, an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany.
The approach is very critical in German-Turkish Internet forums discussing the police and their later investigative success.
Why it was thought the German authorities do not much more to look in right-wing extremists after suspects, the authors wonder.
Some ready shows at least rhetorically drastic steps: "Mainly here will continue, the migrants have no other choice than the defense and the armed forces."
"That will probably be the best self-preservation."
"From the goodness of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very strong domestic peace in Germany is," writes "selenium."
What it means when domestic peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen shows up in the 1990s.
The photograph of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance in right-wing violence can result.
The attacks, however, that sharpened We-feeling on the Turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past,
In the Turkish press to visit the survivors of Mölln was challenged at the time, especially the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused.
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a message of condolences to the Turkish president, was represented at the funeral service in Cologne but by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel listed in his speech, how many charges made the local Turks.
So, when the value of a man charged after the level of its tax levies.
The current reporting by the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks into the domestic law has since then.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
