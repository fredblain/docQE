Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
There is an issue that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions must be treated, so this is certainly the energy policy.
Influence availability and cost of electricity in direct Maβe purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is sensible to have a choice to make reason to think about this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should sound their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution pushes a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, should not have to give up a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, ease the shortage of fossil resources to be able to continue producing steady electricity needs, without forgetting the compelling need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate verschwundenes subject to combat climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changes any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains blebt isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision of the need for a substitution capable replacement source to find, even in Switzerland, which barely intends to build only nuclear power plants in the last generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states are following their projects opposed to continue with determination.
For its part, the United States decided after Fukushima, merging their park another unit, using the decommissioned after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island plant back in operation.
Although it focused on renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, the reality is, however, the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, one by the increased use of Importgas enhanced energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase of gas and coal plants-made CO2 emissions.
The entirety of this unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is one European tables leaders in wind, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the largest users of coal and gas, used in with wind energy; because of its CO2 Ausstösse and its electricity price is about 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a contrary to our French households by 40% higher electricity bill.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key part of competitiveness and a stability deposit of industry on national soil, the French companies have given the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction of nuclear power would draw a strong increase in the price of energy, which could be the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of illusion.
The polls show that this is a price that the very broad majority of French people are willing to pay as little as it shows resistance against the principle of this energy source.
Let us build that the energy policy of our country has enabled, an industry with direct and 125.00 410.000 inferred jobs.
Because of its strong export nature, it brings a host of small and medium-sized companies specialising in international markets and it makes to creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to withdraw from the nuclear power, as this would fall victim to a Groβteil these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink together more and more.
What would instruct an electrician for the functioning of sixty years designed EPR if the demise of his producer is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must admit that there is neither a as a devil of a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
The company Areva developed, low-carbon solutions on the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for maintaining nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for their professionalism, are from the safety position just too obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one in Three Mile Island, has arisen under normal operating conditions; he passed without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was generated by reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters with unprecedented, caused the death of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, just as they had done after the two previous.
As a result of this approach, and the cooperation of the security agencies of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft, which allows him to withstand such phenomena.
Because it is considered among the electrical technicians as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, a freeze in Flamanville would be a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, by letting them free rein to reissen the leadership in the inevitable nuclear development.
It is essential and legitimate, after the best Energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate that defined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
