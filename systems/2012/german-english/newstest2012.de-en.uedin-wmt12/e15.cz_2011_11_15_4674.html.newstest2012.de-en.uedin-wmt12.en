Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence
We wish to find a suitable word that the strategy of IBM characterizes most closely, then that would be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern enterprise, although a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for the longevity of its first chief, presented the visionary Thomas J. Watson H.
Before he took the slogan, countless global problems could be easily resolved if people were willing to think a little bit.
His slogan: "Think!" Was the trademark at the life of the future giant should set (and at the same time, the title of the corporate internal magazine, which are already at IBM in 1935 issue began).
This was also the basis of Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture.
"For us from IBM this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates, everything else around to change.
This allowed us during our first century to transform the technologies, the business and society.
We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company said on the occasion of the "anniversary.
-conceived system
Watson ran back in the 1930s social care of its employees, in a similar way as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia, the IBM-people had as one of the first American workers paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a thoughtful pay system for best innovators and traders.
Sophisticated as the long-term relationship of IBM are with their customers.
The company was brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM lifted any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination policy of the current plan, the Palmisan will alternate at the head of IBM next year by a woman is also - of Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years at IBM, before they took the position of Vetriebs-, marketing and strategy head.
IBM makes in recent years, so-called online Brainstormings, which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are plenty of ideas, the company almost half a million people are employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their steadfast position in the Business guarantees the company a strong image and this after within and outside.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," The Economist said the professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company to solve business problems with the help of technology helps George Colony of consultation firm Forrester Research added."
As the company itself points out, there is a distinction to be on the market only present or to shape it with this presence directly.
IBM - named in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue" is grown in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most diverse technology companies - IBM is developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible product broad - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of the American technology companies IBM has the majority of patents and five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his best-known inventions bank machines, credit cards, financial swap, bar code or the diskette include, for example.
With approximately 220 billion dollars of stock market value (market capitalization IBM this year was the second-largest technology company (right after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - unhappy o / 2 were, for example, the attempt with its own operating system, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not be emotional tie to the past," says that Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build his ground on various platforms - and if they do not work, them to leave again.
Unlike the rival Microsoft, which is in principle with its Windows operating system and falls.
Promising technologies,
In the profits of IBM services, software are participating in the greatest degree and hardware participate on each one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still represent a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most.
Since 2000, IBM sold little profit abwerfende assets worth $15 billion in the same time, however, it invested 58 billion dollars into the shopping promising technologies.
In these investment IBM continued even after 2008, when the latter-day financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept across the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, which increased in the midst of the Great Depression its investment scale.
So far, it appears that the company IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig at 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
The company slogan of IBM is: Everything can change - not only the values.
It is to be expected that this flexible giant resolves the next crisis.
IBM-history: The cheese Schneider to outer space flights
The one hundred years ago in New York society founded IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating recording Corporation.
The name IBM took it until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later society IBM laid the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren on registration of the work begins and -endes.
The architect of this new company Charles Ranlett Flint, who holds the presidency until 1930, was on the board.
And it was Flint, who stopped the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that it helped him in the running of the company.
This Leader was then even the founders of IBM in the shadows - based on Watson's ideas until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name suggests, with the production and distribution of all kinds of machines for trade - of sausage-and Käseschneidern to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson headed the company, he has doubled its turnover at nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was so essential for the company that he sat whole 40 years in the head, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson younger.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, engineers and computer from IBM helped NASA flights to launch into space - for Merkur and Saturn and in 1969, the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System / 360.
A classic PC that determined the computer-standard that time came in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the consul aunts part of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and a rose to fully into the business with Consultingleistungen and services with high added value.
The strategy is paying off IBM in the last three years, Planet the concept of "smarter."
It is the intention to use technology to clever way, not even in previously planned areas, for example to improve the situation in transport and in the cities of administration.
In the commercial sector IBM recently introduced the platform "smarter Commerce," which is intended to help dealers to lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Before 1932 IBM established a branch in the then Czechoslovakia - even as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM is ČR including a strategic outsourcing centers in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe take up residence in Prague and a top team of researchers is also world-class that deals with the technology of Stimmerkennung.
