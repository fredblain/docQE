Troops feel rather than respect sympathy
The event was a Wall Street-gala, collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and naval gathered around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring, said.
A senior military officer at the gala, which was watched by, among others, former chairman and chief of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure that the organizers said it well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, really. It was a pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distanced, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say service members.
The public is increasingly acting as if it would do the people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigade along Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan will go soon after.
"But apparently the only way is the support he is made to fit into the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in the dispute with the public, which they serve.
They have also acknowledged that the anger that proposed returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War against was far worse.
As a result, there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from fighting with marines, the retired colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see its service from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe, as they were defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether an "angry, violent veteran is hiding under the surface," Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and on his return has a senior government posts in Washington over said.
During his search, he said, he sensed that some of the subtle Theys obtains interviewer whether he is able to withstand immediately after his return from the fight the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"When you talk about your service, you need to keep the negative impressions about it," Cancian said his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted partly in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield are picked out of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, only rarely as praise.
"We as a nation value military heroism not more so, as it was still in the Second World War absolutely normal," said retired lieutenant general David Barno, commander of US forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses mostly on the suffering of a service members.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks that have endured it, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
