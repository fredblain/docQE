Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn I had a bit gemeckert that that was a bit too much stuff for the start.
I was not aware at all, what is yet to come.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how it is "on the square."
It to get much worse.
Ever closer examination, the more information and practical tasks lie before us.
But even if of course everyone weekends, he is shown yet.
This time we debated it on course with director (not a single man participates), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And, after all, most of us.
Some have a short neck, the other too jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are rather tubby.
It is up to conceal the Stylisten, broad shoulders look to extend the neck or hervorzuzaubern the necessary curves.
We also got pointers as a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - with great bosom, broad hip and fine slim waists - nicely and figure attracts said, without being too provocative acts.
If the difference between slim waists and waists, for instance, is so great that the skirt or trousers fit really not, it should be at least adjust a bit after level.
This will not regret it safely, because well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock one feels much high and verrutscht better than in an off-the-shelf, which constantly in the slim waists absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, construction Chen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
This amount of information and figure types, I am glad that I have to go a whole week time to leave me everything thoroughly by the head.
And yet I am afraid that it is not to create in the face of assigned homework almost.
Each of the course participants inside was allocated a Promi, for which it is to devise appropriate attire - days clothing and Abendrobe.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the relevant stars and its Figurtyp.
I should attract Miranda Kerr "," which you may know from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Inside I juble, because it is much better for me personally to attract than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which increased in the last period of the hundred kilos has (oh well, that is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or look on the Internet, and then extend process graphically.
"The Moodboard," as the whole outcome is known, will come our very personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
Indeed, it is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist attracts the model not only physically, but is also the so-called product page in the magazine (after specific target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).
The Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture.
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday lecture was seasoned from three visitors from the industry:
On Jan Stylisten Pokorný, Jakub Polanka by fashion designers and the fashion photo Graf Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us to exploit that fashion is illusion and that should be a Stylist capable of this.
Stylist eingeschickter and able to work with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way.
The magic word means variability.
For example, you can wear a Trenchcoat as usual over the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can take him but also on the naked body, attract (shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up our sleeves or the collar and the whole look is quite different.
"It plays," he stressed.
But the most important to me was the following advice: "First you need to know the rules of perfect."
"Only then can you hurt them," said Jakub.
Finally will have to clear to me why we Pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if one in Modejournalen altogether different often gets to see.
Of fashion look not to mention.
Thanks to the photographer Ben knows I photographed now that a Stylist must have much more clothing variants prepared when he eventually.
So you have for a Fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten attire) to be prepared to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
With all this, we must therefore expect in shaping the attire.
That image and sometimes Styl account for half of the success that Jan Pokorný confirmed to us.
It looks like Madonna to view a not particularly brilliant singer, made in the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one of the services of a Stylisten is more reserved.
Well-known personalities are so often for wasted money (the main thing is that I am a little, as I look at) is secondary.
And if someone gives us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is likely to consume another (smaller) size when he or she needs in reality.
One needs only to then googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding Promi have again too or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and assemble them then the Outfit 'needs. "
In his work he needs to communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a clever psychologist.
People appreciate without cosying up and stand on his opinion.
"If orders us any manager to sift through their clothes cabinet and to complement beautiful pieces, then we can overcome them, not the entire cabinet and say, my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few good things on which it recommends that you can wear them," Mario says.
He showed us quite specifically, which must include a so-called "seat pocket."
So as a pocket one zuknöpft on the slim waists and in which it takes all necessary Proprietäten.
No such clear things like scissors to remove the hair Abroller or safety needles also contains such Utensilien as a Nylonfaden (hence the Stylist helps the photography of products, such as handbags or IT IS NOT BE Bill), specific clips, bled with those behind the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other jam are forbidden, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
So that we can but not only to listen, but try something practically, we learned how shoes under-soaked right.
The photography studio courses, where the floor is, one can damage the Schuhsohle, let alone the outside.
Us o-soaked and we stuck...
With the gap, it should not affect the shoes, so that we do not damaging them.
So we must be really cleverly.
Mario enjoyed myself when he praised mean "creation" without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not my strength.
All this was just a fraction of what we used to listen in on the second weekend sex-continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me now - to address the Styling at professional level is not an easy task.
