Europe has invented democracy, now remains the European democracy to rethink
Democracy is a valuable asset, also a delicate asset.
The European continent should be able to remind themselves, who endured after its invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of World War I, of totalitarianism, the Holocaustes, of the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Portugal and the Salazars Oberste in Greece had about themselves.
Some probably thought that it would be sufficient to exercise the right to vote in a way as to see the democracy prevail once and for all on their enemies.
You know since Napoleon "the small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient, condition and can be just as well for the "oppression instrument," as it said at the time of the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is also very and first and foremost, political democracy.
The change of heart of the Greek true-false-referendum would have had in this regard, insightful character twice: Once the need for a strong return of policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today have shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer go in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised on the needs and rightly in order.
A free ticket for the European ruler or blindfold a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: A groβartige choice for the citizen.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, mature from full right, and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, moreover, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which makes the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
One is concerned about sovereignty transfers in the direction of Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is gradually losing its sovereignty, and each of them connected nations.
The urgency is to give the sovereignty of the leadership of the European project back to the hand.
Because it is situated on the set, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of its debt from the markets and a future investment by hand.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that cannot be made without total democratic Rechtmäβigkeit without us certainly to destruction.
After this proposal was by Jacques Delors and the Socialists long fought over, everyone is pressing the European economic governance.
In agreement.
But imagine it without political integration and greater democracy - something the citizens - would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need to take a new stage of European integration.
In order to emerge in France, the Republic, it took the fact to "create Republicans."
The revolution of interests alone could not make enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a economically better integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We Europeans need to create Europe.
