MSS presents a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity to
They Social Security Institution Mexico heads a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - Mexico's Social Security Institution (IMSS) announced that it heads a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional de Siglo XXI said an interdisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, Krankenpflegern, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud pública (INSP and) at the Centro de Estudios Avanzados Investigación y de (Cinvestav) del Instituto Nacional (IPN Politécnico.
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties may be coming to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 a.m. conducted tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and continued since the October 8 on the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
If the aim of 500 to 600 investigation persons is achieved, the study on the sports ground will continue of Independencia (in the south of the main city district) and concluded at the Morelos (in the north of the main city district).
He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors Mexican children and young people on the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the world day of diabetes, he said, it will be sought that three thousand young people and children aged six to 14 years should, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents fill nutritional questionnaires.
You will also raised questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to control risk factors that could have diabetes and renal insufficiency.
He would also resulted from that of the aforementioned Saturdays the investigation people measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood glucose values such as the mirror Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt by the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would be carried out at the concern of the screening on the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that the proportion of obese boys at 77 percent and the girls have less than six years with obesity increased by 47 percent. The obesity has risen dramatically," the specialist of the IMSS stressed.
He said that the search for genetic marker was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico Unterschiede from other nations.
He said that a (e) (Mexicans into) on average to 65 percent Indian-American, European and 30 percent to 5 percent of African descent, as reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity tread in the inability to burn the surplus of us put energy (calories), so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researcher said that the direct benefit for the study participants were found in a comprehensive study of the children, whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the appearance of dark Hautfalten in the neck and on Innenarm (Akanthosis that point to the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, studied.
All information will be treated confidentially and told the parents in writing by the doctors, and the doctors tell the parents all measurements and propose them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors for overweight, obesity and other chronic disorders: Lack of exercise, lack of movement in everyday life to spend most of the day in front of the television and to use transport to walk instead short routes.
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of beverages and total carbohydrate content (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high in fat and protein intake and genetics, which should be analysed in this research project gezuckerten.
