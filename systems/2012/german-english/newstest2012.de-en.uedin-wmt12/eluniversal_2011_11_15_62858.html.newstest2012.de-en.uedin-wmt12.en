At a press conference Jácome Dionisio Perez, secretary for communications and transport said that the pilot had confirmed before the launch, the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel had in 25 metres altitude contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were in the investigations in the area where the plane was derelict, found.
"In looking no aircraft parts were found in other areas, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates why he fulfilled all the conditions for the passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and staff) assured in Mexico that the helicopter was flown by the Estado Mayor Presidencial the surcharge with trip flight speed and dropped the plane on a soft hillside.

At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome listed, six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation.
View flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight to the rules of the term flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground would have had sufficient sight.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight further in the direction of the border between Mexico City and the Mexico-state attracted some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team had chosen because of the clouds a lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Perhaps it has been before the impact either an unexpected event on the plane or a deviation from the passage.
Verstreuung the remains of the plane in a limited area.
Until now, the information suggests that the helicopter from precise and seitlicher direction was aufgeprallt.
The pattern of the plane scattered debris suggest that the helicopter was aufgeprallt with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion.
The remains of the aircraft to offer either the accident close to fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
In the field research aircraft parts at a level of 9200 feet above sea level were found. The sloping terrain and has a Schrägung from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Certain information indicates that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area which went beyond the wake up to shut-off area of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the-bodied aircraft structure on the ground.
