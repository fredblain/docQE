What represents the fraud in sick news?
After the family benefits UMP and government are now the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, November 15 in Bordeaux, visiting a family aid coffers and make a speech about it - already since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which comes from the desire to review the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, is no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on workers sick reports.
First, with budget economic objectives: The government is aimed at introducing a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick reporting for workers in the private sector.
In plain terms, this means that a sick worker without approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A Maβnahme who create, according to the daily newspaper Les echoes' anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.
And the (to go along with another Maβnahme rather symbolic nature: The civil servants a unvergüteten Karenztag in disease case so far, there are) for them, in one of the three Gegensatze Karenztagen in the private sector, no Karenzfrist.
Meanwhile, these issues in the debate are also generates the majority of the fraud issue, with the abuse associated with Arbeitsabsenz mind this time.
"Checks will be much more important, and moreover, this rückzuvergüten if requested Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November warned," before the microphone are the station RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this story appear on the reality of fraudulent acts unproportioniert in terms of sick reports a little.
This is, in fact, already the subject of constant scrutiny since 2002 and political offensive operations, which have borne most fruit.
The French are not more frequent ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, we stayed in the first nationwide paragraphs.
According to the country hospital fund CNAM more than 237 million euros days were paid compensation in 2006.
Gemäβ of Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care daily compensation in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros represented 5% of health spending.
Under this amount 46% on maternity leave, as well as accidents and 54% Krankheitsurlaube concerning the heiβt fell 6.2 billion euros.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health.
In 2010, the French were allowed to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma consultation group averaged just 14.5 sick days.
An average, which was certain differences masks: Another in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, published, showed that 75% of 40 000 surveyed, French workers claimed to have taken no single Krankentag.
Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of the sick were reported in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with its European neighbours, the French workers tend not more so than elsewhere on sick leave.
One in 2010 by two researchers of the French, state Centre for Science Research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that the global Absenzquote oszillierte between 1994 and 2001 (away or otherwise justified), and in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick news represents a tiny proportion in the black economy.
Regarding the fraud is achieved only a weak Ausmaβ.
Encouraging legislation since 2002, that there are systmatische controls on sick reports, the 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public university has found for education and training of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the lost 285 enjoyed, short-term sick reports, the heiβt unjustified in 37.050 cases, "or were too long."
The systematic controlled sick reporting cases of more than 45 days duration to be counted among 1.2 million 11% "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, the heiβt 132.000.
This makes a total so 169.000 "unjustified" cases to millions of workers who have made a sick reporting.
A paragraph that represents only a weak Ausmaβ against, for example, that of the black economy.
According to the UMP-Member Dominique Tian, author of a July Sachberichts published on this issue, is that between 9 and 15 billion tax loss of earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation at last.
