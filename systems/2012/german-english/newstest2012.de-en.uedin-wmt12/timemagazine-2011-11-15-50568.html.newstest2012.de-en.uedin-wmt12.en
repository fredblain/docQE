7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
What will Apple's fans, but perhaps the most recently discovered in the jobs-interview, which was dusted off this week before special film displays on the major markets, is how much this has understood creative head business processes and procedures.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous detail organizer who eagerly Measures Have Been cobble Together in Diagrammen - a man who believed that many managers suffering from "a disease of thought" that "a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] it is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series' triumph of specialist idiots "at the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with jobs together, in which they had a rare, detailed talks.
At that time, since Jobs was driven from Apple had passed than 10 years, and already he worked hard on his new computer company next and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part used by Cringleys interview in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of the interview were missing in the supply.
Only after Jobs death we discovered a complete VHS-copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: The Lost interview," which comes this Wednesday and Thursday in the country Mark-theatre.
For someone who is known that he loathes detailed interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly keen in explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies.
Incredible and wonder where U.S..
During the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds inward, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts and trying to accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfect day comes when he responds to questions and seemingly impatient Cringelys anschubst him respond more quickly to issues or alongside acts of greater importance.
Included in the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone the Been Lost to interview seems somewhat sinister far-sighted if Jobs assesses what other companies make his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read eulogies posthumous career jobs. "But jobs to be seen here as the thrill of greediness dreamer, who is on the leap to the grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be, and should be.
Shortly after he had this here said everything, he went off and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to lead a company:
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask: 'Why do you play?' And the answer that you always have is: 'Oh, it will simply made."
No one knows why he does what he does, and no one in the business really thinking carefully about things.
What I have noticed.
Jobs from leading his efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.
Puzzled how costs were recorded, mostly began with "standard cost" that have been put on mere suspicion, and were then reviewed with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the transaction costs could be determined by-.
As the pope was kidding:
Jobs told of the "Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could creep into the long-distance telephone company and result in vain.
On the device much has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a gebührenpflichtiges phone, make a phone call and then link from an AT & T-network to another, while they slip through so many satellites as possible.
"We sent on half a dozen times around the globe and if you grölte into the phone, there came a minute later in the telephone next door," Jobs tells kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world can control."
Both of us, we knew not much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that there would be without it, Apple.
Jobs told on a glorious stroke that Wozniak and he almost have taken to phoning up in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and the pope wanted to speak with while they have made them so well after Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk with the American diplomat, who both had to loslachen before the Pope himself came up the phone.
As he falls into the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett turned):
At the age of 12 years he sought when after spare parts to build a frequency meters, he sought after Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views, which was a company and how it treated well his staff."
Later jobs of the HP-staff who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer, which was ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with brown ruling tarmac and I love with me in it.
I would climb at HP as teenagers and hang on this machine and programmes to write them.
As it improves innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs speaks about how spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career he built in, when some circuit boards contains, he was asked by a customer together to assemble the entire computer.
He worked think through with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the Zusammenbau and the extradition of ready-made equipment.
Later, with Apple, he remembers the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse.
"I remember very strong arguments... you cried myself to that it would take five years [] would cost to build a mouse, the $300 and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredible credible.
On companies that diminish great:
Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs lost the ways in which so many industrial giants defaulted on their visions in stumbling and control over their shares predicted.
"We say that you are working with IBM and Xerox, make you a better photocopying room or printer, and na?"
They have the shares monopoly, so the company is not more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [there are] such people who ultimately lead the companies and the product, with which the people from the decision-making process.
The product of genius that has led to this monopoly, will of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products eradicated - craft art necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
We could be 10 times greater, the Microsoft could have been of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"There is a lot of hand-crafted art between a great idea and a great product... if we develop this great idea, it is changing and growing."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
We must make votes, certain things that you cannot but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must remember 5,000 objects, bringing together these concepts, and all of them...
In the end, it boils down to the taste, it is that we are trying to create the best stuff that people working and then tried to bring these things to what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always in stealing shamelessly great ideas.
Part of what made great Macintosh was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
Would it not have been the computer industry, they would be fantastic things in other areas.
