Deutsche Bank has on their business with agricultural commodities?
According to Spiegel-Online-information Josef Ackermann has asked a working group, the consequences of speculation to examine the world's poor.
In January, the company chief will then draw consequences.
Hamburg, -
For the federal citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable, according to a study that banks are speculating with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.
This is the result of the Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that the Food Watch presented in mid-October.
This is the author Harald shows Schumann that betting on the global commodity exchanges are driving the prices - and therefore the banks take a complicity in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of entrusted directed specifically against Deutsche-Bank-chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are similar.
Originally hedging against price fluctuations were thought commodity traders bet.
But now, most experts are have agreed that the gamblers decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism that he promised to look into the allegations and said that no deal was "worth the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk."
According to information obtained by Spiegel Online, an International Working Group is examining the allegations from the Food Watch-Report.
Until the end of the year, the review will be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, how to deal with it.
At the end of January to tell the head of the bank, then, what consequences it entails.
At the end of a reduction of the commodity business could be, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann forge his image
Foodwatch-head Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically as reckless banks today are damaging the common good."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on prices," said Bode.
"Regardless of whether it is Mr Ackermann for people suffering hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The realization of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear that the company chief a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head will not change differently than planned in the supervisory board.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural-speculation he could clean up his image.
And about potential losses he needs to care little by little, his successor would have finally to do.
Every second would terminate commodity-plants
Foodwatch, the pressure on the manager to keep high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday Bode published the survey, for which the institute Forsa interviewed on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
Just 11 percent think, therefore, it is legitimate that Deutsche Bank is offering facilities involving bets on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also consider personal consequences if they learn that their bank terminate participate in such transactions: Every second of the poll would all facilities where money flows into the commodity-speculation.
43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to reflect, to cancel their accounts and to switch to another institute.
