V need for steroids: "The run" - the illegal racing across America
Review
The original reckless journey through a series of could be avoided entirely, amateurish errors on routine journey on the morning shift.
It was able to meet the ambitions in large part, but what use is that when clearly had no desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part inspired with the subtitle "The run 'high expectations.
But he promised that already old games series "need for speed" to postpone a bit into a new dimension and the spielbaren demonstration in play, he seemed to be just one of many Action-Rennspielen.
We were curious to know how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But, as it is used with NFS already, in effect, is much different than it had expected.
Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade-race, but overall the game will be reduced by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of a largely incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
Firstly, it will be introduced into the history, whose main character Jack has certain problems personal character; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, it is the wheel - with the task to be the first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and in more than 50 individual races.
This means that every race is being played on a different route, and that the various stages held in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
There is no time to offer the impression that game would always the same.
Some environment are still look very attractive, although the technical level of the chart does not exceed that of the previous parts of the series.
Therefore nothing earth-shattering news.
But the journey through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high through deep snowy landscape we visually very pleasant.
Occasionally atypical elements bring a little change in the individual races.
In the desert, for example, will be surprised by a desert storm, which limits the view.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to watch your step that we will not be buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are quite well integrated in a row the individual races.
Only a few, but they range.
For a while it tries to the mandatory number of opponents to overtake () in principle, a classic race, one has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then an expected even a personal duel with a single opponent.
And even the police is interfering, which wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive Animationen where Jack before anyone and where he flees the player must help by at the right moment, the right button lies.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there is in the game, much less such passages, as one would expect (specifically) probably only three.
Ultimately, this is the matter more to the benefit, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it belongs in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game diversify.
The Fahrmodell moves in the Fußtapfen of the previous parts.
In other words, seen by today's focus, it is no trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it would be bad.
Anyone who looks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But an action invited the European Fahrmodell Rennfahren will remain very well, although we could find better in the competition.
Until then, everything is so far wrong.
Real problems appear only after a certain period of time.
Unlike the Fahrmodell the collision model is not quite OK
In a game of this kind is not that complicated deformations such collisions and calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea how the car is behaving, not everything is in order.
Case in point: The close do or sail at oncoming cars scratches "one in some places the other car only slightly in others, but it is almost identical situation into a tailspin and wild performance centres.
Or the chariot sails straight to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart-system this is nothing is annoying, it always is.
The rest Arts are resolved as: If you total damage has or far away from the route ends up, then one raises the game back to the last indication of the route.
Only in every race, one only has five rest Arts.
If you have exhausted them, everything starting from scratch.
The rest Arts is more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we should not leave it better.
Sometimes, but not even the Restart, there is nothing else helps to learn than the critical section from the head.
Very uncomfortable that the same things happen often in the same places.
Some curves, one must drive, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise we simply by not fit.
Elsewhere it at the appropriate juncture "civilian" cars is always in the same configuration, regardless of whether you first or fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly annoying in situations when you see that the counterparty easily ignored in one of two oncoming cars, but before it even gets there, the cars are already in such a position that it must be avoided or slow down.
And it does not matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation ever close above your nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is always on the same spot by the same opponent obsolete and again without regard to the timing.
The most crazy this at the end of the game is on the long bridge that happens in countries.
The counterparty needs one here to overtake come hell or high water.
And if he is in one, he takes one, of course, the view, so you drive the car initially there a couple of times in Klump.
Clearly, we want to make the game more exciting and exciting events simply but this intention is so clear that it spoils the joy of a fast game.
And that is a pity, because despite the game is easier Fahrmodell action carrying a total of quite entertaining and in places so that we know almost no longer, which is one of the head.
And what is, in principle, "guilty" because the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the races in a way - is that no boredom can pay, or something quite different...
An unusual idea is also the venture exchange during the races.
No one should overlook the petrol stations along the route, because you can change the car, although the car is enough in most cases, which has just one.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical operations, for example on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history is) the tasks-mode (challenges - the races in various localities, which we know from history.
There are not just medals, but also experience points to win the own profile that) together for the tasks (challenges and is history.
Started to be open-minded to get to the higher level of drivers to various objects: From the car to the Backgrounds the profile.
This is linked to the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own results achieved with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible slip-ups Doing is a situation in the last race of history.
It comes with the car in a subway tunnel (as), where they raced in the dark on the track long (as).
On the Tacho paragraphs look between 150 a 200 km / h) (nay, but there is suddenly from behind an underground and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial, we will probably still argue whether this was a blackout in the game makers or whether the authors are so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall picture is in most cases, rather bland and here and there, even brilliant.
Even more worrying is that, in some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slower and it is sometimes quite dramatically.
This is, however, notably the accidents with greater numbers of concern, where benefits a continuous FPS anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste thing.
In a bid to such a broad as possible scale raise more young audience, was a Sound Track a lá "by everyone" something - but who is buying such a game for the music?
The overall picture of the need for speed: The run? The feelings are mixed.
If the game would not diminished by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have been able to argue with the held the belief that The run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But as the game is somewhat immature.
In for a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for a sting these mistakes with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern in the eye.
