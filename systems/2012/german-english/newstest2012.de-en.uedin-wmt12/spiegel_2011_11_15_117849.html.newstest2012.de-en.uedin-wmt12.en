In Vienna 21er
The pavilion moving
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: The Austrian world exhibition pavilion gained from Brussels 1958 prices, was in Vienna for the museum, was empty and down-ate-heeled.
Now he will be reopened as exhibition house.
When dreams of modern postwar architecture of clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials that are typical of the faith in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Expo is a good and well-known example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time, received the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy and float along-steel-glass-design.
The construction is until today as a milestone contemporary architecture.
He made the architect known as that of the next World Expo pavilion built of Austria.
With his legendary BMW-Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich, he was famous in 1973 finally internationally.
Its construction as a temporary exhibition planned pavilion was established after the World Expo in the Swiss garden at the Vienna South station, opened in 1962 and converted to a museum of the 20th century - the '20s House "was mentioned.
Likely was the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls for the hanging of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will be used in future as a museum of contemporary art.
The Belvedere museum opens Tuesday evening, on which the House, where the first exhibition - a fluke in every respect.
Enforced the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco, which was 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, PhDs art historian with considerable career including the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, got the refitting strongly among politicians and Denkmalschützern, they obtain public funds and private sponsorship money and established the use.
Except against the works of art were sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a book shop should be, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had converted Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna Secession sensitive and expanded and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him "tremendously important place" was that he had seen "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and ease.
The current reconstruction there were far greater problems: The building was "a Energieschleuder" Krischanitz says.
The window profiles of the glass facade were changed, used glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and replaced the glass roof by special glass.
Chill bridges-steel carriers are reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been refurbished.
Two bullets were in place for the new use, a abgesenkter light gap between home and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer-pavilion.
The original outside doors remained, the House is removed in the old rotbraunen Rostschutz-colour.
And the cinema hall is even more exactly as it was before.
And all this under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and points to a raw ground in Untergeschoss.
Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the building remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said that a typical "rates-in-the-City history."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a proper awareness."
In this case, the 21er House has not happened but in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: The Swiss garden just around this completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier arises," with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke will occur perhaps: The 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall, and we hear that it is negotiating with the city for a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
