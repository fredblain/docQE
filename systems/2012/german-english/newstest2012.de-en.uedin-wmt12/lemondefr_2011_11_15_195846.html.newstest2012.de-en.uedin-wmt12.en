The CDU proposes to elect the EU president because of general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally intended in the program, but particularly in order to make those activists enough that the government policy regarding the Greeks today and tomorrow may assess Italy as too lax has prevailed in the autumn.
The Presidency motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine among 1001 delegates had voted against, ten of the voice had abstained.
The standing ovation lasted several minutes, which were due to their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro-finance ministers open minded, no doubt.
The main idea of Chancellor bears - like the Antrage - following slogan: The answer to the crisis "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly from the euro."

To calm the climate within their party macroeconomic Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, however, has not tried to win their Congress at the expense of "small" or the European countries in difficulty, which immediately criticised the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe devotes-application of the importance of the "German-French friendship" a paragraph, Angela Merkel calls France not to the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig faced two centuries in the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, the zuhöchst humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
