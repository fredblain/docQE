Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, was just one of many boys who had their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to have committed a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public hearing in court.
Despite Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has spent a lot of time until his attack on his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on the part of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But as you find them?
This is easy - one need only www.securityjam.org on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not hard to reach them Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory Demos says," on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding of personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, Bartlett that the researchers must use the Werbetool page says simply to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly as retail for years to do it.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and reshape them with Adds, but instead to connect with a new band or a new diet product, the Adds invited users to a poll in which after their education, their attitude toward violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
You Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues in the situation, more than 10,000 supporters were to question of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they would have to leave once their office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion "are those who remain their online activism combine with an off-activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health and social trends, such as in "Likes" text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content on average per day, generating Facebooks "data Super Nova" has a research boom that increase the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title in the last five years by nearly 800%.
Some researchers for the beauty of Facebook is the fact that we can study this side of people who are not normally reaches with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried earlier to interview people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party and which would have never given access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook that everything falls - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues have found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to the problem drinking remained silent as students on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, help Wohnberater, monitor the side and a student, if that too many status updates postet.
"You can't solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who had not been found different."
Facebook also zapft constantly to the data of its own people.
The data team the side has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a National Happiness index compiled (which were used in the first place, according to which only Facebook has access, master of digital freedom have long known that the side should make their big data treasure trove for others for research purposes.)
But the users of Facebook know that the side is watching them, whether they like it or not, in order to be able to play with a friend who is thousands of miles away, Scrabble, one page allows apply their own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook are part of a survey that they do not even know something?
While researchers have set strict guidelines on how they collect their data offline and online everything is permitted.
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles Neil Selwyn, a sociologist says," the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public sides of students on Facebook.
"What they are concerned, it was all about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in a user profile and contributions are true.
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two entirely different things," said Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social aspects - and plenty of social life will take place still offline."
