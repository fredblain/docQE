Boeing draws record contract of 18 trillion dollars in country
Two popular airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 more planes.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner in Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company gets a contract over 50 of its products.
But it is a big deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co and the list price for these 50 aircraft at a record total of 18 trillion.
Equally unusual in charge of Boeing: The Middle East, a growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East needs over the next 20 years, 2.520 aircraft worth 450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two standard Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer mission came from the Dubai airline Emirates.
The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 at the Dubai Air Show, an option to buy 20 more planes that the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.
Then on Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air summoned six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, which improves fuel consumption and the comfort of passengers.
The list price for six of these aircraft stands at more than $1 trillion.
"It is absolutely positive for Boeing," Neal Dihora, stock market specialist man of Morningstar said.
"The quality of this particular customers is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are owned by the oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the aircraft, and a rise in oil prices, which normally hurts the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, not as damaging as the country on a higher oil price deserves.
This is important because they are less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position in the market for aircraft and helps to keep the rival Airbus SAS in check, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the biggest A350, which would compete directly with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the introduction to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher Nutzlast and reach.
The Boeing-shares rose by 1.5% to $67,94.
