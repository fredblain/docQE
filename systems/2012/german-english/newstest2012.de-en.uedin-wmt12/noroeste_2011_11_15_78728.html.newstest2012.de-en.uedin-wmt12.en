The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogue to digital signals in recent years of the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) the Constitution complaints submitted by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and force be brought forward the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 rejected, due to the lack of eight votes that are necessary for law dispute.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, took the view that the President Felipe Calderón have not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision of the Senate launched constitutional dispute was rejected because it did not obtain the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or on the non-constitutionality. So the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed that the decree would declare unconstitutional because for radio and television regulation in question is the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the law decree the hierarchical principles and the law to keep dissent.
Voted in favor of the project only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies submitted constitution complaints against the decree. After the adoption of the complaints, the minister Sánchez Cordero implemented the decree and was not all work for the establishment of the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said not to agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government must not with general rules regulating the measures, which will take the public administration.
"I do not believe that if one that would do to the independence of the regulator would be compromised." They reminded that for planning strategic policies, such as the sector of telecommunications heads, for constitutional reasons, the central state government is responsible, because the state affairs.
The replacement of the analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years around the world, and it leads to a better use of the radio electric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The delay of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest, which have not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, they said, "made the action of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state they involved a group of characteristics that set the constitution into the hands of the central state government."
They called that had many countries around the world, the digital conversion already carried out, and on the government they had, although over highly specialised facilities.
It could not conclude that the government intervene with the launching of the contested law decree in the powers of Congress, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, "she said.
