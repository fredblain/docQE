Development of the trip prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The agents then sold mainly only travel to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, in the West at the time were allowed only select group.
And as Czech tourists to the Baltic Sea) travelled (in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, into the Soviet Union Sochi (on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and use it to Hungary.
An internal exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then a proposed Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia have been severely restricted.
A major paradox of the socialist times was that it (not even citizens of the Soviet bloc, including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of ČSSR individually, for example, wanted to travel to Poland, or even in the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered to travel to the West, but then they had to take huge queues in buying or sleeping bag before the travel agency sent, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter was long gone.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people granted - the others could not travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was no free exchange face currency without foreign exchange commitment so it would be impossible to the necessary funding (Western currency) find for a trip to the West.
The most Czechs weither therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless bought second homes and dachas, a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 were a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, of which it is aware today no longer is the fact that it was not the most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia travel until 1989 at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s, the last century to the foreign exchange duty was lifted into the neighboring West European countries, eliciting a huge wave of short visit mainly to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could be had for a long time from their trips to the West simply not enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days.
The Czech holidaymakers sleeping on trips to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have already had the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czech was a with canned beer and duration sausages etc vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades of our tourists were able to buy the Western currency finally free.
Our standard of living and, hence, the average salary rose, which empties into another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel agents began after 1997 regularly prepare travel by charter flights, leaving the air travel through the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, incredibly makes it cheaper than in the past.
The end of the 1990s had the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already loose foreign currency transactions with all advanced countries of the world, which travel made even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-Velvet 'travel occurred in 2000, when the first direct charter flight was due to the high demand checking into an exotic country - after Thailand.
Since then, annual direct charter-aircraft fly with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it directly from the Czech Republic 12 flies to exotic destinations.
Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year.
Another important moment in the era that characterized our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States lifted visa requirements for Czech tourists, making our country is in the process offing modernisation is definitely among the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs) for the first time spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50,3% and for the first time in their history they spent for a single holiday stay at the resort, including the cost of more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.
