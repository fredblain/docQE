Smart crows DOE spreading in cities from
In many places, Saatkrähen are considered "problem birds." But from the towns of the highly intelligent animals can no longer drive, experts say.
Some like it, others want to get rid of them very soon: Crow does belong to the city for centuries, but many local residents complaints about pollution and noise of the animals are multiplying.
A means is not against the "problem birds' so far in sight.
Saatkrähen were to get out of the cities no longer, experts said at the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen empty.
There, experts from the entire federal territory discussed possible ways out.
They are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists led the problems in towns and cities to the rural exodus of the most protected Saatkrähen: The chemicals used in agriculture are destroyed in the increasingly traditional habitats.
The hunt, increasing building and the felling of typical Brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds.
I come are under conservation.
Large colonies with more than 600 Brutpaaren there is, among other things, the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west including Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
In 2005, had made a controversial project to mass killing of crows DOE in the district for negative-headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of animals in bird traps and the Erschlagen with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the vergrämen, brings nothing," the urban planners and landscape Werner Klöver noted from empty.
Wegspritzen nests with water or felling trees, often have undesirable consequences, the environment expert Manfred emperors also said from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are avoiding large colonies to divide and spread to other places."
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, old age homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we will get them away."
Without the surrounding areas, the problem will not be solved in the city, mayor Wolfgang waiter said from empty.
There was a combination of vergrämen of animals from sensitive sectors of housing and offers to resettle them elsewhere.
"Info tables will chainsaws" campaigned against the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgen for an entirely different treatment of animals, "a Pickel in the face, we can endure confidently best."
Jürgen in Schleswig-Holstein had the ashes Berger Crow does co-Lehrpfad where signs informed about the life of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen.
The project will be adopted already by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds Jürgen opinion had: "There is a lot of communication, which have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen not only use tools to get a biscuit, but produce as tools of their tool even themselves.
Behavior, researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested in four Saatkrähen how far the intelligence of the birds enough.
In one experiment, the birds learned quickly that they must bring with stones a scaffolding to collapse, a Mottenlarve.
Without much training they realized determined the size and shape of a stone to have to collapse at the platform.
In a second attempt the smart crow does kniffligeres then had to solve a problem.
In a vertical Zylinder set the researchers had placed a small Eimerchen with one Mottenlarve.
With the beaks of the birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had had them wire pieces.
Hence all four animals shaped a catch, through which they then sit on the Eimerchen grip from the bag.
Three of the four Saatkrähen was even at first sight.
