Euthanasia and accompanying Freitod must be legalised, a panel of
The Canadians live in denial of death, as stated in a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, institutions, healthcare facilities and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best limited resources, and on the cases of cancer alone.
The Canadian society lives in an unwillingness to the death.
Only 9% of a Canadian who can actually out to talk with their doctor about conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved, which are linked in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends the government to amend the penal code so to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election is, in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent company EIU, the death of quality in 40 countries of Erdballes had compared with each other.
Although Canada has placed in the 10th grade, the study notes that the rate of medical care in Canada "has created a culture in which people are raising fear, the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadian who have no access to painkillers, of the Royal Society of Canada appointed experts tell us.
And despite the majority of Canadians wish to die at home, but ultimately 68,6% of them die in hospital.
Viewed from across the country, the rate of 86% of deaths that have occurred in the hospital in Quebec is highest.
In the sensitive issue regarding euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are threatening the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert to want to make any changes to the penal code on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide.
But now there are loud legalization experts who have inspected gleichermaβen all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide or have entkriminalisiert would not draw any proof that such decriminalisation Miβbräuche in its application, the practical implementation of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide of unkompetenten einwilligenden persons or not.
On the contrary, we meet far more cases of such transgressions, particularly in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalise as yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, practiced."
"Also assisted suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly here illegally," says Jocelyn Downie.
The euthanasia Canadians
Let us that in the year 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted-already-85% of the Canadian who geäuβert itself in favour of euthanasia, as they are of the opinion that they would like it to alleviate people at the end of their lives, their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of legalization of euthanasia was not meant to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled besäβe less value.
With regard to the people who have already used an assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to maintenance or suspension of funds in patients, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
They also suggest in its recommendation list that should be mentioned in the penal code that the dumping of the funds, which have a legal rejection of operation, not as a criminal should apply.
The panel also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task of having to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and fear that without prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions, healthcare facilities and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment to put the best limited resources, and on the cases of cancer alone.
The panel also calls on the already in the Canadian institutions to far-reaching health care funds used for pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take them at least in recital, since they served as little as the euthanasia to reduce physical pain and these and IT IS refers to the same procedures.
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the judicial area of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the experts' report by the Royal Society of Canada.
Ra Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health law, has the attitude of the report undersigned experts, among other things, as "extremely" because they have the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stages of any borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone who lives tired and older than 18 years is to ask another person to help him in his suicide," Ra Deschamps, who had looked at yesterday a summary of the report.
Ra Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report appeared on the ownership of the individual to make all other values that are involved in social knitted society.
But now, he says, there was "guidelines and commitments in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist on health law, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which they described as "pro-euthanasia-manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questions, in particular, the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalised, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
