So was the work of the doctor, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali referred as the man, who identified "Alfonso Cano," in history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoskopist of investigative unit of the prosecutor (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) did, "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week was cooperating Eliazar Gonzalez on-call time, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years in criminal investigations.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go five days into the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were that he should identify.
In 2000, he moved after Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses he specialises in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin is exposed to the friction of the hand and foot land.
In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano I put clothes for at least three days Eliazar pointed out.
Great things expected him.
Friday night, he flew by helicopter of Palmira after Cauca.
He knew he should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion was that the might of the man, who had to be guided the oldest guerrilla in the world, and therefore he should take the ten finger-Abdruckblatt of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
When he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because it was not the images he had seen in the mass media, in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed as a pawn of the area, wore no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints are not lying.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, one Pflanzkelle and a pocket torch Eliazar the fingerprints of the cadaver compared with those on the Abdruckblatt.
He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano."
Still the same night originating from Puerto Tejada was the man in charge of the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón to tell that it really was the leader of the FARC.
At traces search
For a Daktyloskopen by Sijín in Cali the commemoration, which gave the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano" was given very important.
Many people are not familiar with our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the disintegration of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support investigations into accusations of murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the person arrested.
In their arrest many criminals are presenting false documents or they have none.
We will take them and they are looking for the fingerprints in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to grab a piece of theft in a wall of a house, because the thief had aufgestützt precisely at this point with his hand when he pulled a with jewellery and money full gestopften Safe.
"Walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to take the shot around the hand and the offender, who had participated in several burglary identify," he recalled.
With the help of the fingerprints can also be exonerated murder suspects or strained.
Recently, one death was found surrounded by bottles of spirits.
The investigation that a family member might be under suspicion was suspected, and indeed a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, but he is associated with the place where the crime was committed in context.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would "taken by the object."
If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a tape is used for the carriage.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians undocumented," the expert from the CTI said.
He said that not everything was portrayed as it in the TV series SCI.
So as not everything is gold, which is conspicuous, is also not everything that you anything it touches, a fingerprint.
But he can be used if it carries out an appropriate comparison.
