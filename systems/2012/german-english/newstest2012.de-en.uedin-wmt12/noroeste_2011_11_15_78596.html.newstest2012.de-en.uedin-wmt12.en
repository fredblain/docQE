Climatic adversity retarded the economy
In the first year in which Mario López Valdez is in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while falling foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
The Sinaloas history in 2011 will be remembered. It is the first year of the Mario López Valdez, who himself as the initiator of change calls and high hopes on the economic growth fueled by the government, but as a result of the climatic adversity of growth may not be the speech but, on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February caused millions of dollars in losses not only in agriculture, but also happened to the growth of the state economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity at 3.6 percent this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31,16 percent, which had a deterrent to other sectors of the economy.
According to one by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Sustentable (dt Rural. Mexico's Council for sustainable agricultural development) published report on the impact of the Frost 582 thousand hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78,03 percent complete and which were partially destroyed remaining 21,07 percent, affecting mainly the vegetable, maize and chickpeas were growing.
The decline in economic activity until November has increased in the Mexican state unemployment steadily.

These are 18 969 people more than in the first quarter.
Less liquidity,
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year is based on several factors, the economist Gerardo López) Cervantes, dean of the School of economic and social sciences university Autónoma (UAS, commenting on the policy of public institutions declare indirectly the growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors, including loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who amass $illegal manner, it is not easy to make them work to invest or to use them for something else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the country to find work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due partly to the immigration problems and, on the other hand, because it is difficult to find work there, and these people are here and are looking for work, leaving the unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of black. Includes these INEGI under 60,38 percent of employees in the country, who work without paying into the social security coffers.
The black unemployment and low wages, the lowest throughout Mexico), according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Palestinian Authority) for work and social care in Mexico.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was until September 5352 pesos; that is much less than the overall national average, which is 7375 pesos.
In the FDI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and rising unemployment in 2011, the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last ten years, since according to Secretaría de Economía (state economy Authority) was the FDI from January to June 630 597 dollars, with a decline of 87,74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for its part, has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, above all by enterprises from the tertiary sector.
Of the debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the government in July at the National Congress applied for a loan of EUR 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested to reactivate the economy in infrastructure projects in the 18 districts. The country, Congress authorized an amount of 600 000 200 pesos, but no positive effect of the debt could be detected until November to any of the industries in the country.
Reactions of
For the representatives of business, the first government year Mario López made Valdés government incompetence.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of the manufacturing industry in Mexico) argued that in 2011, no efforts to harmonize the views of various sectors, including the government, have been made.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa this year was really very meagre. It must be worked hard to regain the lost ground this year and in 2012, we need to be doubly. The efforts of everyone, and particularly the progress of the already well coordinated eingestimmte government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated with each other," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the start of the year complicated the economic development of the country and slowed.
"The poor economy river is the result of several events, including the Frost, one of the most important impact is a slower economy, which is not sufficient to cause an economic dynamism, which could create a reasonable flow of processes, products and services, so we will finish the year well below our expectations," he said.
Appeal newly define
Teodoro Salazar prompt Uriarte, chairman of Theys Patronal de la República Mexicana (Industries) declared in Mexico's Sinaloa, the state must become more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have seen that has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and line of the country to develop, because it is important to activate the Sinaloas material and human resources," he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision that draws the efforts of the government to better track.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current state power have made progress in the government.
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more. What I can say is that it was done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of her," he said.
