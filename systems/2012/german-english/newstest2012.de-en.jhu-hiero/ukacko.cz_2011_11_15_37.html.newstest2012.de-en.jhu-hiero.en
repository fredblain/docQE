Eu-botschafterin vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt pulling out of the '.
I did not expect to have such a hard war entbrennt. "
"It will take five to six years, until the dust settling and all will be accustomed to her new role," began Milena vicenová, the Czech Ambassador to the European Union, strongly their presentation to the law faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "understandable and openly about Europe," Ladies and gentlemen, was already in the first part of their address, in which it gained the institutions of the EU and its relationship to such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some Lektor the Law Faculty of the karlsuniversität should therefore have beneiden.
Mrs vicenová, also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism that he is too smoothly - a grey official, was no match for such a role, but I have to say that it has all the breath up how well he has adopted the cause.
"He is a man, it is ready to listen patiently to 27 Member States to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then said in response to the question: who is the actual - the European Union should? what number I call? ', that is to say, as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of the policy on States, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our ölmützer quargel
Mrs vicenová devoted the agenda, according to which the European Union intends to lives lived, and lives in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the presidency, describing it as a major negativum, which have severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech currently has its hands full representation in the EU.
In the words of the Ambassador said, it was not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome, quite lively.
And there is still the EU's sieben-jahres-budget are approved, what makes it precisely because of the present economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a schlankes and thrifty budget which industries will be given, which countries more and less support - all of that is now on the agenda.
The Ambassador also recalls their own slogans, with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
"If I do not like something, it is gräuliche acronym, fremdwörter and jargon that no one understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really krumme or round cucumbers and different large bananas in Brussels invented just now or whether anyone actually want to ban the quargel us.
They used the soil of the EU also would like to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of the prospect of two or different speeds
According to the eu-botschafterin the Czechs in the Eurosceptics, the more the negative reputation, perceive as the positive aspects of the matter.
Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivierungsbriefe and, last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the success of the Czech Presidency, the Force's and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, of V4 shows.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian to me and is a slowake in the vicinity, then does the Frenchman beside me:" Hey, what is your view the heads together - this is your V4 again? 'and it makes a pretty acid look.
According to Mrs vicenové expect the EU particularly tough rules for the budget-politik of Member States in the future.
A lot of real as a "European Federation" is the concept of a Europe of the two, or even different speeds.
"Here we have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We already have the Schengen area and we have to institute a bestärkten cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, want it, and those who do not want to calm Stand aside."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately amounts to a" strong "Europe of the various speeds," Mrs vicenová expected.
In this respect, they also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed by all Member States, and not just by the countries of the euro zone.
