Development of the reisepreise since 1989
Until 1989, there was only five approved of the čssr state agents: Čedok, sporturist, ckm, Rekrea and autoturist.
The travel agents at all, only sold in the Socialist ostblockländer, in the West were then select.
And Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR, the Soviet Union - Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea, the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary in the Balaton.
A light exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then a pro-Western course, Yugoslavia and therefore have severely restricted the travel to Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of socialist times, it was that there are not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc, as well as the tschechoslowaken was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the čssr individual wanted to travel to Poland, or even in the Soviet Union, then took it to the einladungsbrief, otherwise individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, travel agents also offered huge queues in the West, but then we had to accept or even before the schlafsack agent stay, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
Also the matter was far from over.
The of devisenzusage - the condition for an exit in the West - were given only "politically reliable" People travel - the others were not.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not free umtauschbare currency, without devisenzusage, it would have been impossible, the necessary funds find in Western currency for a trip to the West.
The weither most Czechs spent their holidays at home, no wonder, therefore, that the Czechs countless wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that still continues.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989, following a reiserevolution Czechs in the foot.
During a holiday in the GDR or until 1989 in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year were 4.5 million of its auslandsferien in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, one that we no longer aware today is the fact that the currently popular urlaubsland of Czechs - Croatia could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the start of the 1990s, of the last century was the devisenpflicht lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which is a huge wave after wave of kurzbesuchen especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany stir.
The tschechoslowaken long time of travel in the West simply could not enough was there, everyone wanted to get at least a couple of days.
So schliefen Czech tourists travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a canned beer, and dauerwurst, etc. vollgepackter kofferraum.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades, our tourists the Western currency was finally free shopping.
Our level, thereby also durchschnittsgehälter surged into another important moment einmündete in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, the travel agents began after 1997 prepare regularly travels through charters, which travel thanks to negotiate the possibility of mengenrabatte, incredibly cheap compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, had already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, made the travel more easily.
To another interesting moment in the history of the "post-samtenen 'travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand - have been the first direct charter in an exotic country dealt to Thailand.
Since then fly direct charter-flugzeuge with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries every year; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
In the 100 TSD, Czechs travel every year in exotic places.
Another important moment in the era of our development marked "post-revolutionary," came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States visas for Czech tourists, which is einreihte definitely our country under the advanced countries in the world.
The Czechs spent in 2008 for the first time more than half of their holidays abroad - 50,3% - and for the first time in their history they gave to a single urlaubsaufenthalt, including the cost of per capita CZK resort more than 15 TSD..
