Read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcript has been included in the online-ausgabe of La Naci처n.
For your costaricanischen fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Is a dream to play in Costa Rica, which achieved for us.
This is the second time that we play in South and Central America and, until now, it has been great.
I am only once been on holiday in Costa Rica, and it is such a beautiful country, we determined that a couple of days they will stay there.
It is exciting for us to bring our music out there.
I ask you that because the fans of the band completely revealed, and see the days before the concert intensivst.
What does your your begeistertesten fans?
Thank you, all these years to be on our side.
We have taken almost 21 years, until we arrived in Costa Rica, thank you, and we are sorry to have waited so long as long as needed, until we got here.
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have staged over the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played for a couple of riesenshows in Sao Paulo and we hope that the US fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we are happy to surf, and the jungle is enthusiastic, for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you have got to know their Costa Rica and Its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend site and I have a great friend, who lives in tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always the surf to Costa Rica and Nicaragua dangers, along with Mexico, the excellent places to surf, and in this way, that we have people that love surfing encounter.
With an eye on the tournee have offered their riesenshows with many liedern.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we have never played there, we are no boundaries.
We are going to try to be the best show with many different liedern. We want to play a couple of song from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
Her your repertoire never repeated.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine records and more than 120 songs can play another song. Everyone likes, so that each of the decision, which we are going to play, is not easy.
If we have two or three song, which we have been played no longer, the repertoire to we can maintain our focus better and surprise us, because they remember the reasons why we did this song; otherwise, they may have been forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I believe, for the audience.
With this tournee celebrates her your years of history.
If you zur체ckschaut, it is hard to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I think that none of us has presented, even in a great rock band to play, and that more than 20 years, and this is like a dream.
We are also further on this blessing and find it great, and are still able to make music together.
We may and we are enthusiastic to produce music.
We are fortunate to be able to go to the places of the world, which we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you to have actively participated in the birthplace of grunge?
It has always been an honour to belonging to this group of large bands.
We are good friends with people of Soundgarden, mudhoney and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and rather unusual, when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
A bond emerges from a city now and again, but it is unusual to see five or ten groups at the same time from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the seattle-gruppe.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were on a festival with Alice in chains and Canada with mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tournee. We look forward, still to be friends with all of you and it's honorable that have us, part of this arisen seattle-sounds.
It is very unusual for a bond zusammengeblieben so long as your with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and little Mr Cameron met us 13 years ago, which is much more time than many bands alone last.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive, and also we care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical opened a path which each of the freedom to experiment.
A familiar other and its music, and it could not be better off.
Your relationship with the glory is not always easy, on the other hand, konntet thanks to your success always do what your wolltet.
How will take place her balance?
The way in which we are grown, has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We are safe, not too often tournee, because it is too easy to love this game with huge crowds your music, to lapse.
Until you consider that the people are because of the music here, reminds you this because the music and what it has created, eighth must, without intent to be a famous rockstar. This has never interested anyway.
What memories you have on your other project mother love bone?
I think we have very good song written and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy - Andrew Woods had never issued a plate.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce - fairweather and Greg, GILMORE, which built the bond, a friend of mine with us, when I hear a song or see photos, I think because of what an incredible person was Andy, and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure, to go to work, to laugh together and talking about music and football and many other topics.
It was an extraordinary person, and we miss him.
Read the domestic bond robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Knows, it is true that their work, especially Eddie vedder, and the band have picked for the opening?
Yes, the production of videos of several groups and sent us this bond appealed to us best and that is why we are curious to see what robertas read live can offer, which will definitely exciting.
Why does the text of yellow Ledbetter always playing, if you live?
That is a question for ED - Eddie vedder, I have no idea.
He is, and I believe that is the first that occurs to him.
Wurdest you as a bassist influenced by whom?
By so many +
Among the first, which I thought, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck dukowski...
There are so many throughout the afternoon, I could talk about the bassisten liked,.
As Pearl Jam has managed to keep the grunge alive, even though there is no longer a modeerscheinung?
I do not believe that we all feel very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands strike me, which I have mentioned, for example, mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others who were raised at the same time, if they are still important, I think it is great, because it is good to hear this music and bands as mudhoney better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of song on the new album, the somewhat lightly could work, but there are other songs such as the end or just breathe, considered very dark song, although they have something positive in itself.
On both came to me in tears when I heard Ed they played, and it is very dark song.
I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happens in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - affects your artistic creation and your music and these two song represent clear for me.
However, I also believe that you be a happier person and still dark music.
