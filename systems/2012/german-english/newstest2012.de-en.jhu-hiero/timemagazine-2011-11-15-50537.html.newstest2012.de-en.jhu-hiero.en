Walls have eyes, as researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became The New Face of the extreme right in Europe, Norway Anders Behring breivik was only one of many boys, the anti-einwanderungsmeinung online programs.
On Monday, breivik, who has been committed with a gun in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack at his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, extreme groups on the part of social support networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how will they be?
This is easy - you only have to look at Facebook connect.
"We have noted that it was not difficult to come to you," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report of the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hiding place of personal data is enzyklopädisch, Bartlett, says that the researchers simply use the werbetool side need to define their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers have done for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of extreme right wing groups in the whole of Europe and then visierte with adds, But rather than with a new band or the adds users have a new diätprodukt verlinken, invited to a survey, in which after their education, their attitude towards violence and asked the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 very right wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult only once Her Office had to leave.
"It is quite a new method of inquiry," Bartlett says.
Some of the little surprise results. online-förderer of extreme right wing groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "Those who combine their online-aktivismus with a offline-aktivismus sensible, democratic and less violent than those who remain seated behind her computerbildschirmen."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook will mean a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and political scientist will use the side to study everything from health to gesellschaftstrends as "likes, text messages and statusaktualisierungen."
With more than 800 million active users, facebooks generated the add three content per day on average, "datensupernova" forschungsboom, the number of scientific work in the name of this side of the title in the last five years has increased by almost 800%.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook is the fact that by studying this side of people, which is normally in the street with his clipboard can not achieved.
"If you tried to ask the British National Party, people earlier, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and should never have been granted entry," Bartlett says.
"Facebook is all this way, they will go directly to you."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to see and to resolve social problems.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who vollrausch discussed on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problemtrinken than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, wohnberater, monitor the side and a students help if too many statusaktualisierungen postet.
"You can not solve a problem if you have not seen it," said Dmitry Christakis, morenos ko-autor and Director of The Child Health, behavior and development at Seattle Children's Research Institute of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children, which would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook and zapft constantly the data of its own people.
The datenteam the side has statistics on the beziehungsstatus and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national glücksindex produced - and first of all claims have been used, have access to the only Facebook - master of the digital freedom have long known that the side of their huge datenfundgrube for others to make research available. -
But the users of Facebook, observed that the side you know, whether you like it or not, to a friend, which is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side one's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they do not even know about?
While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, is anything goes online.
"I do not think that many people have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he investigated the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As for you, it was only for you and your friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in a nutzerprofil and in speeches.
"What they say on Facebook and what we do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, Selwyn despite his years as a technologieforscher considers that a clipboard and a stift are still the best forschungswerkzeuge that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going into the real world and with real people," he says.
"social research must deal with the social - and plenty of social life will take place still offline."
