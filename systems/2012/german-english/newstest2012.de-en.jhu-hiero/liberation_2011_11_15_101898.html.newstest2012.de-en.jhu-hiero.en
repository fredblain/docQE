Energy policy:
Facts About dogmas should prevail
An issue that does not exist can be dealt with on the basis of short stories or because of emotions, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity in direct maβe influence the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company.
It is reasonable to take a wahltreffen for a reason to think about this issue, as well as on the position of the nuclear power.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored the entirety of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should your opinion on objective facts, rational data fundieren.
Although there are 7 billion people on the planet, is the demographic evolution forward a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, should not be deprived of a vital element a huge share of the world's population.
At the same time the scarcity of fossil resources must be reversed, in order to continue to consistently produce electricity, without the pressing need to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, from the environmental debate verschwundenes, to forget, to combat climate unregelmäβigkeiten.
None of these parameters changed the Fukushima accident.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, its decision in the need for substitutionsfähige ersatzquelle intends to find, still in Switzerland, the time, the last generation to build nuclear power plants.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states, continue to pursue their Projects against with determination.
The United States itself after Fukushima have decided that their anzugliedern park a further unity by the following the Three Mile Island nuclear accident decommissioned work again in operation.
Even if the aimed at renewable energy sources, German Model is sometimes as an example, the reality is, however, the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a rise in elektrizitätspreises, strengthened by the increased use of importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, reflected an increase of being caused by gas and coal plants CO2 emissions.
The sum of these unfortunate effects will be already felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives pause for thought.
Denmark is in one of European tabellenführer about wind energy from the 30% of its electricity is, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used it in turns with wind power, which are his co2-ausstösse and elektrizitätspreis by 65%, respectively, and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% more elektrizitätsrechnung.
As the price of energy, a key role of competitiveness in the global economy and a stabilitätspfand industry at the national soil, the French companies have an advantage because the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would lead to a strong increase in energiepreises, therefore, what our country's noble comments on the reindustrialisierung and the defence of Liesse purchasing power to the illusion.
Polls showed that the price of being groβe majority of the French nor is prepared to pay demonstrates, as opposition to the principle of this source of energy.
We remember that our nation's energy policy has made it possible, an industry with 125.00 direct and 410.000 build induzierten jobs.
Because of their strong exportcharakters brings with it a host of specialised small and small enterprises on the international markets and makes the creators of jobs.
France should take the decision to exit of nuclear power, which groβteil would fall victim to these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros in investitionsgüter- and kernenergieexport would be more and more zusammenschrumpfen.
What elektriker would to work on 60 years is designed EPR mandating the decline of its producers, if inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation we must recognise that there are as little as a teufelswerk is a panacea for the production of electricity.
The company Areva developed low carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest level of security for the nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security agency, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants, such as the building in flamanville manner.
The arbeitsteams, which, because of their professionalism, the sicherheitsvorstellung have just made a name to mad.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious accidents.
Only one in Three Mile Island is happened under normal operating conditions; he was without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was created by reaktorkonstruktion and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry is their lessons and learn from this accident, as it had done after the previous two.
As a result of this course of action and cooperation of the intelligence agencies of the French and German industrialists and operators of nuclear power plants, the EPR a draft to its resistance to such things.
As it is considered among the elektrotechnikern and desirable to build a nuclear power station, would be a freeze in flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by giving them free rein Liesse, the leadership in the inevitable kernkraftentwicklung to reissen.
It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and parteimanöber dominate debate, which also been economic, social and financial situation of our country.
