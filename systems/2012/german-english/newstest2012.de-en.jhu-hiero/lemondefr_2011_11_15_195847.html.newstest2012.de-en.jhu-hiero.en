What represents the fraud at krankmeldungen?
After the family allowances UMP and the government are krankmeldungen in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, a familienbeihilfekasse go and a speech on the subject - already constantly repeated since 2007 - the fight against social fraud and raise economic dependence on government.
To accompany this attack, which assumes the desire, the economy in a härteprobe, on the other hand, however, is no less subject to herald the axis of the right focus on arbeitnehmerkrankmeldungen presidential campaign, is the majority.
First, with haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government visiert the introduction of a fourth karenztages account of a krankmeldung to workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A maβnahme, which, according to the newspaper "Les echoes" sparking anger threatens to introduce would assist, however, 280 million euros.
And were accompanied by other maβnahme more symbolic nature: the civil servants unvergüteten karenztag on krankheitsfalle to - there has been for you, in gegensatze to three karenztagen in the private sector, no karenzfrist.
Meanwhile, these questions in the debate are the majority also sparked a fresh betrugsthematik, with this time aimed at the abuse associated with arbeitsabsenz.
Controls "will be much more important, and they have this rückzuvergüten, if it is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November to the microphone, RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of the krankmeldungen a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already since 2002, has been the subject of constant monitoring, as well as political offensive, most have borne fruit.
The French are not more sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
We spend, however, first of all, in the nationwide points.
According to the landeskrankenkasse CNAM were paid in 2006 more than 237 million euro tagesabfindungen.
Gemäβ wirtschaftsforschungs- and dokumentationsinstituts of healthcare, the tagesabfindungen in 2008 with 11,3 billions of euro 5% of health care.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and accidents and 54% on krankheitsurlaube heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% expenses.
In 2010, the French to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the research, Alma Consulting Group allowed an average of only 14.5 krankentage.
Midway, certain differences masks, a different, in 2007, was published by monster.com website for Career Development, showed that 75% of the 40th 000 respondents, claims to have taken a single krankentag French workers.
Another study, this time by The insurance, makes it clear that 37% of the krankmeldungen of shorter duration than 8 days in 2010, 15%; 22% were between 8 and 14 days between 15 days and a month, 15% and 11% over between one and three months.
Compared with their European neighbours a French workers not to incapacity benefit more than elsewhere.
A in 2010 of two researchers of the French National Centre for wissenschaftsforschung, CNRS's langzeitstudie showed that the global absenzquote between 1994 and 2001, illness or otherwise justified oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud at krankmeldungen represents a tiny percentage of the black economy.
With regard to the fraud will be achieved only a weak ausmaβ here.
Encouraging legislation since 2002, means that there is systmatische controls on krankmeldungen which exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM - public universities for education and training of technicians and engineers - found that 13% of 285.000 under 1.5 million controls of the past - short krankmeldungen, or the heiβt in 37.050 cases, "unjustified" were too long.
With the krankmeldungsfällen systematically control more than 45 days duration was one of 11% to 1.2 million unangepassten or unjustified "cases, the heiβt 132.000.
All of this makes 169.000 "unjustified" cases in several millions of workers, who have made use of a krankmeldung.
A paragraph, which represents only a weak ausmaβ to, for example, of the black economy.
According to the ump-abgeordneten Dominique Tian, author of one published in July sachberichts regarding this issue, this is steuergewinnausfall between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, that is to say, more than the total cost of tagesvergütungen and thus far more than the last defraudation in.
