Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees in favour of the tender.
The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate on the importance of collserola again in Barcelona.
In the 1980s, the peak of the now disappeared Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona, CMB, this administration published its schmähschrift on the promotion of collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park city in Barcelona.
He was even in figures compared with New York's Central Park.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park was in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in nord-süd-richtung spread, but upwards of mountains and down to the sea.
The classification collserolas as National Park to play with this idea.
Served as model is no longer the central park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of the yogibärs.
So far, it was in September, when the city a riesenausschreibung, consisting of 16 to competitions, for further zugangstore after collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a parks.
Either that, or someone has gates to country.
The question is: collserola park or mountain itself?
The tender is not only from organisational point of view, but also in terms of the debate in the mouths of a reflection on the city of architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes subject on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who are meeting in the lift up resort.
And this very fact provides fodder for one of the rare matches between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel roldán Daniel modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
It is necessary for roldán ,"" according to the attack on the coast on the "Front On mountains to talk about" if the discourse of ildefons CERDA, on the green apples, has not been resolved.
"You should start from the principle that is taken extremely Park beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is complex, "Judgments of the architect, for the title of" gates of collserola "an" impressive event is: "You should not" be access to a park to imagine, but as narrowing of areas where action is needed. "
Modol, such as roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "inherent in a number of dangers."
Dangers as a result of the "uncertainty and the creation of a public space today with the situation" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the forum had their "swan song."
The first fear is its own limit to what can be developed.
"Limit always means something to determine the next step," i.e., to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments because the current" regarding the general plan metropolitano - PGM base can lead to a real disaster. "
Modol, close to the question of the simplified, believes the side of collserola, in the direction of vallesana "can not be understood as a park, in the direction of Barcelona, for purely topografischen reasons."
Modol, pointed out that there is already a study by patronat de collserola should not "fall on deaf ears," even though he was grateful to the city council that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project, "from the first moment."
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the city in the geleitbrief is gebirges, which allows architects to participate in the debate, although it expresses his "Doubt" Whether this technical profile multidisciplinary team launched the 'right', he says, "We should give - Guidance to architects should only be a tool."
Bayona implies that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, as has in the tender conditions of collserola lack a global vision: "There have been 16 competitions in of advertised," he says, "the axis gebirge-meer. But there is no längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety."
It has, at least in his case meant that he participates in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, would the programme and the definition of a project for a goal of the architects of The ToRs then colliding.
His view that the city should necessarily guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length as required, the soft transition between city and grünzonen emerge.
