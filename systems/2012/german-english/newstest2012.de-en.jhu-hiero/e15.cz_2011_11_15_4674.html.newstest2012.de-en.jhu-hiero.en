Fire story:
IBM's innovator is the second century of his existence
They wanted to find an appropriate word that the strategy of IBM characterized most closely, then this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public is IBM, a synonym for technological revolution, we know it as a modern businesses, though a century has passed since its inception.
The basis of this longevity, already submitted its first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
Already he was of the slogan that countless global problems could be solved easily, if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" has been a hallmark, playing for the life of the future giants should - and at the same Time magazine to the title of the firmeninternen, IBM already began in years 1935 issue.
This was also the basis of the watsen thoroughly prepared culture.
"For us from IBM means this long term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM, survived and was also a whole century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not be zurückschreckte, anything to change it.
That allowed us during our first century, the technology to transform the business and of the society.
We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today.
Well thought out system
Watson operation in the 1930s, social care of its employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: the ibm-leute had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance by entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms as arbeitsbekleidung and a well thought out entlohnungssystem for best innovators and traders.
As more sophisticated, IBM's long term relationship with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the start in the talentförderung - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM, choose any subject - and was accordingly.
In line with this antidiskriminierungsstrategie is also the current plan, the palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year by a woman abgewechselt - Virginia rometty.
The IBM is 30 years in it, so far, the position of the vetriebs-, marketing and strategiechefin.
IBM power in the last few years' online-brainstormings, come from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas, there is enough in the company is employing almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in business the company guaranteed a strong image and both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution that, rather than a mere technologie-unternehmens," said economist Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, rosabeth moss kanter.
"IBM is not a technologie-unternehmen, but a firm that helps solve the geschäftsprobleme by technology," added George colony of consulting-firma Forrester research added.
As the company itself points out, it does make a difference, only to be present on the market or forms by This presence directly to him.
IBM - in the states of their logo because family called "Big Blue," is in a century to one of the largest companies in the world have grown.
It is one of the vielseitigsten IBM hardware and software, developed infrastructure, technologie-unternehmen any hosting and konsultationsleistungen in an incredible produktbreite - of servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technologie-unternehmen, IBM has the most patents and five of his employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
To its most famous inventions include, for example, bankautomaten, credit cards, finanzswap bar code or the diskette.
With about $220 billion stock exchange value - market capitalization - IBM this year was the second largest technologie-unternehmen - immediately after Apple, Microsoft outdated and it for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the taste of the customers of today - were unfortunate example of the attempt with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online-service prodigy or computer IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on advances achieved, that is to say, we should not emotionell tie to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem, his ground to build - and if they do not work on various platforms, leaving it.
In contrast to counterpart to Microsoft, which in principle with its operating system, Windows and falls.
Promising technologies
Participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest level of services, software and hardware participate on each one fifth.
It was 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share most represented.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfende assets to the value of $15 billion, at the same time it invested $58 billion purchase of promising technologies.
In this investionen continued IBM after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world.
Here, too, IBM was loyal to the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression increased its investitionsumfang.
So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today's crisis without prejudice.
The value of the ibm-aktien rose raketenartig by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's profit grows kontinuell.
The unternehmensslogan of IBM is: Not everything can change - just the values.
Also can be expected to meistert this flexible giant the next crisis.
