21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilions located
By Mrs wiensowski
A architekturgeschichte with ups, Downs and happy ending: the Austrian weltausstellungspavillon of Brussels 1958 won prices, has been to the museum in Vienna, and verkam was empty.
It is now reopened as a ausstellungshaus.
If modern nachkriegsarchitektur geschwärmt, clear forms, glass halls, courageous schwüngen and new building materials, which are typical of the faith in the technical progress, the Austrian pavilions located the architect Karl schwanzer is for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilions located, then won the Grand Prix d architecture for his easy and schwebend acting stahl-glas-konstruktion.
The construction of valid until today as a cornerstone of contemporary architecture.
He gave the architects known, that also Austria's next World Expo pavilions located built.
With his legendary bmw-vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem nebenbau in Munich, he was 1973 finally internationally renowned.
His planned as a temporary ausstellungsbau pavilions located there was established after the world in Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof converted and 1962 opened a museum of the 20th century - it was called the "20s house."
The building but was neither physically and technically suitable as a museum - no walls to hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been so long used by the contemporary art in Vienna was getting a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf krischanitz pavilions located rebuilt, he is now "21er House" and is used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvedere opened, which includes the House, the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes husslein-arco has enforced the New START, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere was in 2007.
Husslein-arco, qualified art historian with considerable career including the youth as eiskunstläufererin, later in Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the Museum of Modern gründungsdirektorin Salzburg, began strongly among politicians and the denkmalschützern, they acquired the restructuring and private sponsorengelder and determined the use of public resources.
Fritz wotruba except gegenwartskunst, the works of the bildhauers should be issued by the eponymous foundation, a café and a bookshop, it should be, and a bürohaus had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was krischanitz the ideal person to work.
Not only because it Joseph olbrichs secession sensitive converted and extended in Vienna and had won the competition, but because he has studied in schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilions located "was, for him, an" incredibly important place in which he had seen "Almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the ur-entwurf, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his umnutzung generosity and easily lost.
The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: the building was "a energieschleuder," says krischanitz.
The fensterprofile outside glass were replaced, glasfaserverstärktes isolierglas used, and the glasdach replaced by special sicherheitsglas.
Kältebrücken-stahlträger are strengthened, and asbestgefüllte blankets have been repaired or replaced.
Two untergeschosse led to space for the New use, abgesenkter lichtgraben between the house and the road is belichtung, a bridge leading to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy schwanzer-pavillon.
The original außentüren have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rostschutz-farbton removed.
And the kinosaal even very, just as it was before.
And all of which will be under strict supervision of the denkmalbehörde and with a small budget.
"A material often had to be found, it is good and is cheap and the denkmalschutzamt appealed to," says krischanitz and points to a ruppigen soil, in the untergeschoss.
Despite all the constraints, problems and restructurings, the building remained flexible and easily.
Was it difficult with the pavilions located, "the daherkam from Brussels," krischanitz has recently said that a typical "drop-in-the-city-geschichte."
This kind of architecture is "always in the wrong place," and was still "create a proper awareness."
In this case it is 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke of luck pass: around the Swiss garden is just the completely new planned "hauptbahnhofsquartier ', with offices and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may happen: the 21er House could increase by another krischanitz-bau, because the sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin temporary kunsthalle bought, and we hear that they have to negotiate with the city by a garden of neighbourly location within the Swiss.
