The worst female untugenden: What's with you?
If you ask the men to mention some of typical female untugenden, then shake them all some breaking up.
Love women, see you in the following lines once again that we are a couple of unsitten reflect, the men's blood in the adern let Wallen?
Einkaufssucht
Raises their gatte, einkaufssüchtig?
They must buy at least one Hader weekly?
Do you like to buy and must be in action just a bit more?
Then it would really be a weakness in their case.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their einkaufslust reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, that Mrs believes it has been, sitting on the search for a good oberbekleidung only through a kleidergeschäft bummeln and did not include all - in all kinds of farbkombinationen try in the booth?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for the majority of women, it is often the pure hell for the men.
Just think how often you have already said her husband - you time to stick out...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too fat?"
"I would take at least five kilos - should I start to joggen or gymnastik?"
"I gefalle you at all?"
Sounds familiar?
Yes?
Then I think they belong to the women who are downright obsessed about what they look like.
The long does not mean that you should go, but many men allergic reaction to constantly if your wife about their appearance whinges.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of the complaints are the women are unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, fliesen and dust, a sweep that will scheuern - at least twice a week.
About their partner because he again with dirty shoes on the clean fliesen trampelt chastise the children, because the gescheuerte in waschbecken once again bad way and is once again, because the glastür on wohnzimmerschrank fingerprints, although the polieren such trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of 'devianz', then you should know that we should not exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life not in the first place.
Ultimately, this excessive reinheitsfimmel can harm the mutual relations and, above all, the calm in the family.
Sticheln
'dirty turnhosen come in the wäschekorb. "
"You want the old socks really attract again tomorrow?"
"Not simply took a watery in raises on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, they should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme.
Clearly, this is not bad, they only want but said that the everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not need so much to meckern.
Gossip and tratsch
Some women and tratschen clap like, as will behind the backs of getuschelt or even slander or you forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relations, so they hecheln like issues, such as, for example - who, where, when and with whom, how and why.
Women every one of us has a bit of harmless gossip and tratsch in camp.
Hand on heart, which is all women board.
But that is not to be confused with klatschtanten gross calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, are all in their area, scorn and especially for frauenkollektive pose a significant danger.
