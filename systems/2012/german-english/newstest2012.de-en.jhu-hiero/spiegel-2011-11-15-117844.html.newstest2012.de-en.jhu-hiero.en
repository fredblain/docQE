Deutsche Bank is rohstoff-geschäft review
By Christian teevs
Is the German bank with agricultural commodities to their business?
After spiegel-online-informationen, Josef Ackermann, appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation on the world's poor.
In January, the konzernchef then draw conclusions.
Hamburg -
For the bundesbürger the matter is clear: 84% of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agrar-rohstoffen speculate such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents, even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other lenders go out of this business, because it is exacerbating the problems of the poorest in the world.
This is the result of a forsa-umfrage on behalf of the consumer organisation foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to the foodwatch in October.
It shows the author Harald Schuman, the betting on the global rohstoffbörsen push up prices - and therefore the banks bear the blame on global hunger problem.
The campaign of the body providing protection for consumers is specifically against deutsche-bank-chef Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, act similarly.
Rohstoffwetten were initially intended to secure traders against price volatility.
But now, most experts agree that the zocker of supply and demand have decoupled - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the us-konkurrenten Ackermann responded to the criticism, he promised to look into the allegations and said, "It is not a business value, the good reputation of the German Bank compromised."
According to Spiegel online an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the foodwatch-report.
The review aims to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank - with a recommendation, how it should be handled.
At the end of January to the top of the bank then say what consequences it creates.
At the end of May be a reduction of rohstoffgeschäfts, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann forge on his image
Foodwatch-chef thilo bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "The bet on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks damage the common good today."
Ackermann as Supreme bankenlobbyist stand special duty.
"The German bank must remove all facilities from its portfolio, where money is used for betting on food prices," said bode.
"regardless of whether Mr Ackermann for people suffering hunger or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the konzernchef a few months before his departure from the office would like to make a perfect picture.
The German bank announced on Monday that will not change in the boards of the CEO different than planned.
With a retreat from the controversial agrar-spekulation could aufbessern his image.
He hardly needs to do - and possible losses it had, after all, his successor.
Every second rohstoff-anlagen would announce
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, already more than 30,000 users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday bode published the survey, for which the Institute forsa 1001 has asked people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 per cent, so it is legitimate for the Deutsche Bank facilities offering, where prices for food gewettet.
Many clients would also draw Personal consequences, when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: every second, according to the poll, would, in which money flows into the rohstoff-spekulation cancel all installations.
43 per cent would discourage known of such a bank, 49 per cent, to reflect, to terminate your account and switch to another Institute.
