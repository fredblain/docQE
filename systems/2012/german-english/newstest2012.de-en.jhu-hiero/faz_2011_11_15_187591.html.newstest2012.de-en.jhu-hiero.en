The skandalbank of zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS during the financial crisis was almost bankrupt and slides from one crisis to the next since then.
It is now a German.
Axel Weber so it was certainly not intended.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July that he would compete 2013, almost as a spectacular new job: verwaltungsratspräsident Swiss big UBS - an unexpected and lucrative karriereschritt.
Axel Weber pleased publicly praised the Swiss whether their beauty and UBS whether their new fall solidity and has gained warm comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS, the turnaround managed."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald grübel."
But in September, it became clear that it would be completely different.
A trader of UBS in London was all security systems of the bank and around 1.7 billion euros, verzockt bypassed.
Ubs-vorstandschef Oswald raised grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.
The verwaltungsratspräsident of UBS, also wounded as - and since then all questions: When will finally Axel Weber?
Already, it became known that Weber can advise the Bank of February in 2012.
And the verwaltungsratsvorsitz takes it back in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, the tough.
Instead, he is not a banker, professor and bankers and would have had a einarbeitungszeit certainly needed.
In one fell swoop, he assumes the responsibility for a bank's strategy, which has once again proved that they have long been deserves the title of "biggest skandalbank Europe."
Because the UBS is one huge - until recently, it was the world's biggest asset manager, slides and on the other by a scandal over the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is of the once proud Swiss bank?
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be a very large number in investment banking.
So the UBS managed on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion in 2007 vermögender customers more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was vorgerückt as investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent longstanding bankenprofessor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "my students, I have the UBS then always presented a model of a good bank."
"from today's point of view, we are asking: how could I am just so wrong?"
He mistaken huge.
In 2007, for the first time was apparently substantial schieflief that something in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, chief executive Peter wuffli surprising back until that was regarded as a hochintellektueller and ingenious bankers.
A few months later, we ahnte why he was gone.
The bank's investmentsparte was faced with subprime-papieren verzockt and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulders, the UBS announced a capital increase in the amount of a record 13 billion francs.
This was actually investors, however, what about some have until just before the nose gerümpft: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds of Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, so was denied that they do not learned his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to provide new milliardenverluste verwaltungsratspräsident Marcel ospel, even of the next best paid board of the Swiss, resigned in 2006.
In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments on the brink of collapse during the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a zwangswandelanleihe, on which you could be miteigentümerin of the bank.
Shocked the whole of Switzerland was dramatically - because they said, as it is for a small country, if it has large banks.
After all, the balance sheet of the UBS in 2007 was more than five times as large as the performance of the Swiss - see grafik.
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says bankenforscher Geiger.
First on the disaster, the second.
Already a few months to surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and responded to the data on vermögender customers had hinterzogen issue, perhaps with the help of the bank tax.
They also agreed a payment of $780 million to - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and strafaufschlag.
Known for the UBS helped, more or less open to tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for rich clients: the mystique of discretion.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It followed the resignation of chief executive and verwaltungsratspräsident.
And the exodus of kundengeldern.
So the Bank within a few months had lost its credibility in two key portfolios: by the fehlspekulationen in investment banking and asset management by the support for tax evasion.
And just as it has been somewhat calmer again, just as they thought the UBS will now get it once again, there is this unfortunate händler-geschichte: an individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something goes wrong.
And it is clearly: the risk management in the investment banking work apparently still do not.
"with the case of adoboli, we must see the risikokontrolle too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and finanzprofessor on bankinstitut of the University of Zurich.
Also finanzvorstand a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS, the risikokontrolle not under control."
But it was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers have been stood for a long time, guardian of the major assets of the world: not too great a risk to security for money - was the alpenrepublik time across the world to collapse.
The tresore of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and sprüngli is especially noble chocolate.
The core of the UBS in Zurich does still fit the stereotype of the sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit more.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich bahnhofstraße, which leads from the Central Station, directly to the zürichsee by the Swiss mountains frames is true, the schneebedeckten summits.
The buildings here are magnificent, the ladenmieten are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere as we Tiffany's will take place between Swiss traditionsgeschäften as the Confiserie sprüngli.
Reside here for centuries the Swiss banks: the Bank of the palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear.
The empfangssaal UBS is one with a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls marmorverkleidet before big ledersessel, in addition to the bank-logo a great sign for "safe."
The UBS know what the customer is here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse betrayed, but eventually ousted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank will take place.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, after all power, as Swiss Bankers, business with the two big banks.
The UBS has become far too big, it will also - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say there.
"And if there is, you have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, the UBS modified, only high profits and then delivering the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the subprime-dschungel as the Swiss big.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"on that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of small siebenmillionenlandes the largest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lucas hässig, in his book "The ubs-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros for the politicians, to save the big facing bankruptcy.
How did this come about?
We talk with Swiss bankers, So you see the problem, particularly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks to an enormous company.
There was a bank, which is already in the merger was too big for the little Switzerland - and steadily grew.
It helped that the two different vorläufer-banken supplemented the UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank focused Asset Management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalisierten favourable investment bankers came to a lot of money that they could make a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: peter wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 konzernchef of UBS, and Marcel ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that wuffli and ospel were a traumteam," bankenforscher Hans Geiger says.
"wuffli, hochintellektuelle, humble, who knows a lot of models and statistics, and ospel, the top of the bauchmensch, up from the banklehre has heraufgearbeitet."
But the closure of ospel was rely on wuffli.
And wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought that his models were the reality," Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: embolden came before the fall.
Staff of the UBS is clearly remember the führungskräfte-meetings, on which konzernchef wuffli dethrone again and again to the same slogan: Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the world's most powerful Investment Bank.
They led the league with ', "the rankings, which documented the success of the banks the time.
Then, wanted to UBS, according to top.
A few steps were already have it.
In the devisengeschäft and trade in shares, she played at the very top.
Unternehmensberater which have been charged, highlighted a weakness, however: the international zinsgeschäft, in the bankersprache "fixed income," there is a huge gap to the biggest banks.
The UBS have gaps in American hypothekenprodukten.
To close this gap, travelled UBS in an adventure that you almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank and invested a gegründeter hedge funds in American subprime-anlagen ahead.
It into a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage packaged and weiterreichte - but it also risks kept.
Also, as other banks long sought the withdrawal.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS has bought there," says bankenexperte Geiger.
The euphoria so great, so deeply.
The manager had to go after the other, as did the attempts were more difficult than had been thought.
Post in the UBS became schleudersitz and are still shaky.
Who leads the big now, has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, all of the obvious abhandengekommen business models.
Bankenforscher Geiger already has an idea: End in investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank will go - yet - not quite as far.
But the investment banking will shrink sharply, this much is already clear.
Next Thursday, will present the world's new bankchef Sergio ermotti its future strategy.
Of the 51 years old italo-schweizer was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank surprisingly separated by predecessor grübel.
Now he has enforced: he is permanently the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to back the state in the 1990s.
3,500 delete it.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What will they earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber already is safe.
Publicly he says so far, with his wife but he will first seek a home in Zurich.
Next year.
