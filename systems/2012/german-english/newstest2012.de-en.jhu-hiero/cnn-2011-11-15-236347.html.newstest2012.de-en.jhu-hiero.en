We see how much deception?
As studies show, we lies between 10 and 200 times every day.
But, as notlügen apply many of these lies.
Another study shows that foreign each other three times in the First 10 minutes of a meeting lie.
Uncover lies to recognise or "lies" to learn is one that is important for everyone, both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as scharaden, the aim is to "property, to call you!" is the enttarnen of deception, a serious wissensbereich, based on scientific data, collected in the course of the past six decades of prestigious universities, which had extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of this research is that most of the old myths about the lies have been revealed.
Lies look in the eyes.
They stottern stammeln erröten and zappeln not always.
This, we can not conclude that this liar are difficult to detect and enttarnen.
A geübter lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth to something about the structure of the claim that the fine gesichtsausdrücke, learn about issues and timing.
I have spent several years, the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly growing pool of enttarnung to investigate, and it is clear that the enttarnen deception is a modern ability, it is easy to learn and helps us cope in our complex in the world, especially if the stop or the question of persons or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good to inspire other people to their interests and to control their own emotions, and they feel intuitively, how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people more than introvertierte people lies, "selbstorientierte" lies presented that men more often than women, whose lies "to follow other" more - in the rule, they want to protect the feelings of others, that married people of their partner anlügen less often than unmarried people - but the lies they tell, are mostly "Fats lies."
We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed, others feel less guilty, this person angelogen.
As is, whether someone is lying?
First of all, by watching the normal behaviour of that person.
It is called "baselining," the position.
They are a point of reference for the future judge for change.
Watch the position that the laugh, the stimmqualität your versuchsperson.
They should know better, when someone normally keep with the foot trippelt, so that they are not wrong to accuse him, if he trippelt during a meetings with the foot.
Then they pay attention to anhäufungen striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
They consider this anhäufungen alarm bells, the strident, not as evidence of a enttarnung.
People who fooled, freeze, perhaps, if you try to recall their history. Perhaps, their feet in the door and they are in the direction of outcome, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch," this deep, entspannende ausatmen and the change in the attitude that if all the hard questions are over.
Fragende often wrongly indicate that a einstellungsgespräch is over, only to keep looking for this relaxation after the einstellungsgespräch.
They also pay attention to the language of their versuchsperson.
The lapse of Scott Peterson is famous, when he vergangenheitsform used when he claimed that his wife killed is still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distanzierende language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or, if you knifflige question in the whole again.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifizierende language" when they answer knifflige question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... with a good conscience."
This will be the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which is often the alarm bells.
There is no zaubermittel to enttarnen lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to them enttarnung possible.
Thanks to these skills rare anyone can become a victim of fraudsters, both in the private and professional life.
