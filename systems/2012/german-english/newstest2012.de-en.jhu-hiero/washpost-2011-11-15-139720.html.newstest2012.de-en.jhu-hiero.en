Troops feel pity, rather than respect
The event was a wall street-gala, which collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballade on helplessness, frustration and loss.
In a word, collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, the spendenaktion organised in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, the stabchef and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, has been observed, the role of the troops was different.
"It was introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure that the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the severity of relationship between the military and for most of the country, sometimes admiring American public opinion.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say dienstangehörige.
Increasingly, the public is acting as do the people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said brigade general Sean example MacFarland, troops in Iraq befehligte and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way support is the one to fit us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is particularly sensitive for military leaders, or not thankless task in the dispute with the public, they want to serve.
They have also realised that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam war against proposed, was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between veterans.
With his two sons, returned from fighting with the Marines, the retired Colonel mark Cancian they warned that people outside of the military world could see its service from two different perspectives.
Some would see it with a sense of awe, because they were rebels defeated and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a 'angry, violent veteran under the surface, "said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and has adopted a formal staatsposten in Washington after his return.
During his work, he said, he felt that some of the candidate subtly erfragten, whether he is in the situation immediately after his return from the fight withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If sprecht on your service, you say," Cancian said his sons the negative impressions.
The lack of ease of the American military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan is singled out, only rarely as praise.
"We as a nation value military heroism no longer, as it was absolutely normal in the Second World War," said Leutnant befehligte retired General David barno, US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead focused most of the praise of the politicians and the public on the suffering of a dienstangehörigen.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks, which they have endured, the number of friends that you have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
