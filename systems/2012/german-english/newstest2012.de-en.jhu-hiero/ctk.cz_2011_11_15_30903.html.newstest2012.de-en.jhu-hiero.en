The General Meeting is to find a new chairman, again there is a stalemate.
The Czech Football has no chairman for almost five months and there is the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech fußballverbands - fačr - not even after the Extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will be known.
There is still no agreement, after what election rules should be elected.
And without this No vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three players would manage the Czech football - Jindřich rajchl, Miroslav pelta and Tomáš paclík.
In June, Hašek back from his post, where he had his colleagues in the departure of calling to some and a strong personality, could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the aftermath of Hašek broke the old disputes between the two verbandskammern again, which can not agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.
The delegates were quite free to volkshaus general meeting in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the trial produced no result and it was not just about the election itself.
Indeed, one could not even agree on who the vollsammlung is entitled to vote - only the satzungsmäßigen representatives or equipped with an authority officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and right contributed, whose opinion after a representation to vollmachtbasis is not admissible.
The disputes in order to take the election rules, however, remains.
Also the executive did not have more clarity on the matter at its meetings - regardless of whether ordinary and extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election changed a couple of times - the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how can we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The bone of contention is the question of whether it should approach in line with the Statute, or whether a very different model needs to be found," said the Dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the fačr, in the management of the profi-fußball represents.
According to satzungsmäßigem model Triumphs in the third round of the candidate, the greater prozentuelle standing support in the Chamber, for which he received.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher stimmenanzahl receives from both chambers.
The Czech side again, on the condition that the winner of this prozentuellen election receives at least a two to one vote.
"Then the two vorrunden make no sense, this modus would call into question the entire zweikammerkonzept," Svoboda understands the objections of the mährischen side, it would be best, not hinzubiegen, but under current statute to choose the election rules.
Surprisingly, Tomáš paclík agrees with this, even if it emerges that the institution most probably pelta against election rules of all candidates.
"It is my wish that largely elected by the statute."
"Not unreasonable ersatzvarianten thought out, as in the past," said the owner of the fußballklubs Victoria General Meeting Plzeň, standing for the first time in his opinions and, above all pelta to abgrenzte.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
His opinion, known in Nymburk the new chairman and he believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"The time possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly lead to calm the minds."
"If the football only on the euphoric wave is, it is the willingness to cooperate more," says the official Jablonec, all three adepten the greatest experience in both professional and regional level.
Rajchl as cautious.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately the situation is ambivalent."
"It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes" officialdom. "
"A new block at the General Meeting is therefore not excluded."
"I hope, however, that common sense prevails," said rajchl finally.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties is no longer.
Some negotiations should supposedly directly experienced in Montenegro, but who knows whether the fußballgeneralität until qualification game will actually be completely.
The charterflugzeug, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and rajchl should fly to podgorice, in Prague on tomorrow because of a technical disorder could not launch and we sought urgently for a ersatzvariante, as there is a part of the Executive Committee but to the site of the barrage-hinspiels.
Ultimately, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Joseph Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and physical education would have divided parties within the country's largest sportverbands moved to an agreement.
So there is a lot at stake: state benefits, vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting of the čstv, the Czech sport after the financial problems of SAZKA the new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
If Tomáš paclík, the head of the pilsner footballers of the Extraordinary General Meeting to have a strong candidates can represent all of his ideas on the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands - fačr had met, if he had not signed up to the fight for this position at all.
"If there is a good candidate, I would fight for him and to renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not such a adepten to find," said paclík ČTK.
The main reason for paclík to match with Miroslav pelta and Jindřich rajchl to go, it is to ensure that the supposed favorites of the election, pelta, at the top of the fačr anyway.
Paclík also emphasised that, in the event of his victory intends to exercise the role of chairman only a year, until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
Seen in the position of the President he would like to know top-manager, which is not involved in the fußballgeschehen too much.
"with some people in question, I personally have spoken."
"Hard to believe that some said to me that you were currently not identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would like changed," he led.
Most of all paclík allegedly disrupting the pelta's links with the chairman of the pilsner bezirksfußballverbands novel berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, the behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, and with the ability to influence delegiertenabstimmungen at general meetings will.
It is for this reason for paclík unacceptable that pelta had held the position of the chairman.
"in his victory would einkonserviert and today's situation in the Czech football is not making any progress at all."
"The support of berbr, a cleverem businessman, football would badly," said paclík twice.
Here it is also important that pelta's name in connection with telephone to identify some time ago in a korruptionsaffaire fell, however, the pelta go unpunished emerged.
"I do not know what kind of prestige a victory of pelta - tsch. - Football should get involved."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl paclík, his former saying, "He will Pilsner sell fußballklub if pelta Chairman will" see, but something about.
Paclík, should the donnerstagwahl victories, he could present a future cooperation with pelta well, however.
As another candidate - rajchl, thinks the paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"he - pelta - would be the first, I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him a good example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I if my nose resides not in matters that I do not understand," said paclík, so providing for attention in September that he was behind the recall of the schiedsrichterkommission with luďěk macela replaced at the top level, the Dagmar damková.
Paclík even claimed that he felt the role of the verbandsvorsitzenden increased.
And refers to his skills in the leadership of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with his support in May the first celebrated triumph in the league.
"I have the power to change something in the fußballmilieu and contribute to a certain degree of cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disziplinar- and berufungskommissionen, which led to degenerate into horrific situations," paclík, no secret of his antipathy towards the sparta-chef Daniel Křetínský power, for example.
As one of its priorities, would be the strengthening of relations between the fačr and the Czech olympia-komitee, with whose help he would lobbyieren that the political leaders for more money from the lotteriesteuer goes into the sport.
"This is one of the key issues that should be addressed the new chairman."
"When it comes to taxation of glückspielen declare, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but then they must also state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclík is also not a handicap to his link to the pilsner club, even though he stresses that the Chairman of the fačr must be "non-partisan."
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It makes sense, in my opinion, but not much my shares in the club of Pilsner hypocritical to a transfer of drittperson after 18 months back again," said the paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the fačr, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the fußballverbands promised one of the candidates for the vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav pelta, it will get in the case of his election campaign for the fačr gets new statutes, excluded from the dispute over the election rules in the future.
The official Jablonec is the donnerstagsverhandlung Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be defuse safe in any success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September in the event of his choice, he wanted to focus the team and the collection of funds.
He decided only at the last moment, to take part in the election before the last general meeting and liked him two months break help to defend his ideas on the running of football and present in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to football, They are impatient and expect, therefore, that the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the jablonecer club, but in fact many years in Sparta and the executive acted.
He also believes that it has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football do.
He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria, the days of Ivan Hašek was.
"Unfortunately, at the general meeting in June approved statutes, which were not so completely, as all had adopted.
If you had not allowed different interpretations, from September onwards we have already had a Chairman, "pelta said.
The revision of the most important document of the Residents' Association he used as a lure for the delegates.
"I should be president, then I accept its myself and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental thing, without which he can not be," claims pelta.
In further attempts to it does not, its opponents to define.
Earlier he had announced that it will be able to cooperate with Jindřich rajchl imagine that he recognises because his legal education and he knows well that opposition would be his first deputy.
Also Tomáš paclík grip he no longer, which in turn was no dry up pelta.
In football, it moves for over a year and can already point to some successes. "
"but its attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Therefore doubt now addressed many of his real character," pelta remain faithful to his opponents, the most proklamierungen, which he said in September.
It believes its biggest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest spielklassen, to the team.
And it should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to make all affairen to end - from the korruptionsskandals causa Bohemians, to the nachhallen of last year."
"Straight after that I would like to bring negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
Then, he promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football would mean no personnel cleansing.
"I would first like to familiarise themselves with the arbeitsinhalt of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where because of the long anarchy there is understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday not free travel to Nymburk.
"If really should be the only point of controversy, as it votes in the third round, then we can get over."
"Football needs credibility and makes it only by back when he finally has a new leader," pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his funktionärskarriere remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the fačr below him to work hard begins
When the deputy chairman of Jindřich rajchl at the General Meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Czech Republic fußballverbands should be elected, that would supposedly many people in the Association of vermiesen the humour.
Rajchl promises that we begin to work hard in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce a system changes and the members of the executive responsible for individual fußballbereiche.
He also promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve relations with the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and otherwise, to continue the work that the previous chairman, Ivan Hašek has begun.
"as President I would like to pay football as a whole.
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the nationalauswahl, professional football, to the leistungsfußball for young people. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a teamspieler and would, therefore, like to distribute the executive powers so that each Member pays a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football in each segment with meilenschritten to progress. "
Many would not just delighted about this, because it now, rather than criticise the work of others, even should start to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the fußballbewegung have considered to stand no longer.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly stick between the legs and every step I have to throw in question," he said as an explanation as to why he had hesitated.
But "a lot of people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise it would others."
"the confidence is, we should not miss this," he said.
Allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work that he has begun between Hašek.
"We have a great deal of work completed in two years and I will now not just throw away."
"processes have been launched, have to wait for a few years to reflect and I would not see anyone stop," he said, and has now expressed his concerns, in case the other candidate - Miroslav pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach and this is not something that Mirek pelta brings."
"Stand behind him, above all people, which would make the football, that he would be there only for politicians."
It can be some blame, but not to me, I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it all goes well and not only the Select," said rajchl.
It also rejects the claim that he was a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and a mährischen part, whose winners in each of the first league aufstiegen."
"That, it might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players to play in Moravia is a problem," rajchl says.
Because now the head of the pilsner clubs Tomáš paclík has joined the fight about the role of the chairman, rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which refer to their elected deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me," led rajchl, the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unvorteilhafte treaties, the fernsehverträgen and the negotiations on the agreement lotteriegesetz sees as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association is not in a single direction.
While he pelta says, "He was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help," He sees the second rivals - paclík as a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If he is elected, he would probably continue the things the Ivan Hašek has launched, the staff in the commissions, he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly Not the things in its favor hinbiegen want, "Judgments rajchl on his rivals.
