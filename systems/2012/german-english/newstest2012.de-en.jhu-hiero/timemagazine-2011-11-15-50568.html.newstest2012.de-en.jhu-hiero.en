7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, this week has been shown in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed it technikgenie as a great modern inventors.
What apple-fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten in the recently discovered jobs-interview, which this week in particular has been filmvorführungen on the important markets entstaubt is understood, how much of the creative business head outsourcing and functioning.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and even appointed hippie, but he was also a akribischer organisator, keen to diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many directors "a disease of thinking" suffering, "a really great idea represents 90 percent of the work..." but base there is a huge amount of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product. "
1995 developed Bob cringely tv-serie "triumph of the fachidioten 'staff on the dawn of the computer, and he sat with jobs together longer than an hour, in which she led a rare, detailed discussions.
At this stage than 10 years have passed since jobs had been pushed from Apple, and it has already worked hard on his new computerunternehmen next, and pleased at the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of cringleys interview was used in fachidioten, he says, that the kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery lacked.
Only after jobs death, there is a full vhs-kopie discovered in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised filmmaterial forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: The Lost interview" this Wednesday and Thursday in the landmark-theater.
For someone, for which it is known that he detests Detailed interviews makes jobs are surprisingly keen in the explanation of his philosophies in technology and business strategies.
And incredibly pause.
In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds nachsinnen, in which jobs clearly abwägt's thoughts and tries to accuracy.
There are also moments when jobs' perfect days, if it seemingly impatient responded to cringelys issues and anschubst, quicker to respond to issues or nebenhandlungen of greater significance.
Before the era of pixar, iPod or iPhone included, the lost interview somehow seems incredibly intelligent, if jobs valued, what other companies with him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read. posthume appreciation expressed to the career jobs' But jobs here than to see the begierigen dreamer to leap to the original grandeur is something quite different, and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be, and should be.
Shortly after he had said all he drew Los and made it here.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the lost interviews:
As he learned to lead a company:
"During all the years in business, I always question: 'Why are you doing things?," and the answer is that you always AN,: "Oh, made it easy."
No one knows why he does what he does, and nobody in the business think really carefully about things.
That is what I have said.
Jobs continues his efforts, to streamline the accounting for apple.
Puzzled, as costs have been recorded - often began with "standardkosten," which puts for mere suspicion, and were then Adapted "deviation" - it developed an automated factory, who ensured that the geschäftskosten until the smallest could be determined.
As the Pope was veralbert:
Jobs, told of the "blue box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device that you creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls to lead free.
Enthusiasm for the device much has already been written, but jobs, as he describes the blue box as an act of selbstbemächtigung, is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and it would test the box by a gebührenpflichtiges telephone use a telephone call, and then a working AT & t-netzwerk combine to another, while so many durchschleifen satellites as possible.
"We sent the half a dozen times in the world and if you go to telephone grölte, came of it again a minute later, in telephone next door," kichernd told jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something themselves, can control the billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we did n't know much, but we could build this small Ding, that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that Apple would be without them.
Jobs told further from a glorious trick played, the Wozniak and he had withdrawn almost as you in the middle of the night via blue box in the Vatican anriefen and speak with the Pope wanted to, while Henry Kissinger nachmachten as best they could.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night herbeigerufen were to speak with the American diplomats, had the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
As he is in the technology verliebte and unprepared Bill Hewlett anrief:
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, he sought to build a frequenzzähler, according to Bill Hewlett in the telephone book and called him.
Shortly after taking 20-minütigen telephone call received a teilzeitjob in Hewlett-Packard jobs for the summer.
"That was a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in the age and it shaped my views about what a company it was and how well his staff treated."
Later, jobs was one of the hp-mitarbeiter who visited the company's laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop-computer ever to be made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with braunscher röhre and I verliebte in him.
I would take the HP climb upwards as a teenager and hinge on this machine and programmes for they write.
As we improve innovation:
Several times in the interview talks about jobs, as one new products erfindet spontaneously.
Some platinen early in his career, when he einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the whole zusammenzubauen computers.
He worked with a delay of just 30 days and had to think through both the zusammenbau and manufacture the extradition of the equipment.
He later in Apple recall the problems he had in the development of a computermaus:
"I remember overwhelming arguments... you schrien me, that it would take five years to build" a mouse, which would cost $300 base and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer. "
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we are building for $15, the incredible was credible.
On big companies, the slowdown:
Long before he made apple revival saw jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants stumble with their vision got lost and the control of their shares.
"We say that they work in IBM or Xerox, so they make a better kopierer or printers, so what?"
They do not have the aktienmonopol, so the company is more successful.
Sales and Marketing make it successful, "Are these people having the lead the companies and the product, which pushed the people from the decision making.
The produktgenie, which has led to this monopoly, the people who have no idea about good versus bad products, eradicated - handwerkskunst necessary.
That happened in Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times greater, could have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
On innovation as art:
"There is plenty of handwerkskunst between a great idea and a great product... if we developed this great idea, changing it and grow."
We are learning a lot about its subtleties.
It must be votes to certain things that you ca n't, but pair electrons, glass, robots, factories.
5,000 things we must find these concepts, and all of them together...
Ultimately, it amounts to taste, it is that you are trying to address with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to these things together, what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great, was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, zoologen, historians, which happens to be the best computer scientists in the world are common.
It would have been not the computer, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
