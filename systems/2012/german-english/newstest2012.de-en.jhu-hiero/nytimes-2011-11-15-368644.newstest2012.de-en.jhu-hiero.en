Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter englunds new book begins sensitive and generous "beauty and horror: a history of the First World War, told in 19 schicksalen" with a long list of players, which is to heart.
Could a tip, as we do here: Are you this side of careful and make it her lesezeichen.
They are these people in englunds romanhafter narrative, is very well know, and these players will work as their GPS, as the beacon in these few moments in which they englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of their illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he describes as "a work of the anti-geschichte" not incorrect.
It includes only a few Big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little Ambassador, reckless reporters play or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was"; it is about feelings, "impressions, experiences and emotions."
"Beauty and horror" almost the kriegserfahrungen of 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women together on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, krankenwagenfahrer and büroangestellten.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will lose to prisoners of war, gliedmaße, crazy or die.
Each of these flackert as the votivkerzen live in a church, some are added, while other lapse.
Englunds book different from the usual history books.
It should also corrected the idea of the First World War was only of the devastating stellungskrieg at the westfront.
"Beauty and horror" ends with expertenblick on other kriegsschauplätze: the Alps, the Balkans, the ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Bienenkörbe fall to the soldiers in this book, a celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetsefliegen an intractable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the outset.
The lives of these people flooded the war as a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina, according to kordit smell.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children, and kanonenfeuer heard in the distance, you keep or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why the war is being conducted.
"The lack of the facts," Englund notes, "have been on assumptions that assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas of conspiracy theories, dream, alpträumen and rumours aufgemöbelt."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals as Florence farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard blunt, a young German schiffsmatrosen.
Their stories have already been veröffentlichtem mainly memories, letters and other material taken.
Their lebensberichte can be terrifying or simple, but they are very alive in englunds details verlierenden accumulations of small moments.
Many of them act of deprivation and behelfen.
In the history of a German schulmädchens tells it: "replacement, substitute everywhere."
"ersatzkaffee wrong aluminium, false radiergummi, papierverbände, holzknöpfe."
He tells more of the ersatzessen in Germany.
He describes "meat in gepressten rice and in hammelfett gebacken - and was last with a false bones from wood was served, tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dehydrated kartoffelschalen, shoes, with timber besohlt goods."
It was, as he noted, "837 registered nahrungsersatzmittel, which were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered kaffeeersatzmittel."
Some stories are of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges its own drive to wildheit and says: "One feels about the war, that in spite of everything that is what was planned for men rather than to sit in the lehnstuhl, with the abendblatt or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and so, as was such a facade of civilisation and as if there were no barbarity behind its own strengthened and beschlagenen hemdbrust."
Conversely, a British soldier that he probably die and nobody will notice or care.
"If the idea is to sacrifice themselves, gap, you would think that this happens before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as horrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are from the old Europe fall apart, and on new types of terrorism.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He begins a the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiarium of the young century": the word "streamlined and ideologically committed mass murderer in the maßanzug, slaughter, while it sits behind a desk."
People behave in unexpected ways and there are also frivoles behaviour such as heroismus.
Englund discusses the soldiers who are actively tried to becoming infected with prostitutes contract a sexually transmitted disease every year, in order to escape the frontdienst.
"The bizarre expression to the can be discovered in the trade with gonokokken-eiter, as soldiers and schmierten their genitals, bought in the hope, to hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eyes, which meant that they were blind the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves englunds poetry geschmeidig and unaufdringlich and fits perfectly in his human task, however.
In dozens of small scenes, he starts the way, such as the war "uncontrollable forces unleashed in unique ways: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
The people are starting to ask why their leaders in the fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted as Paul fussells' Great was being solved and modern memory "or novels as Erich Maria Remarques" nothing new "as a comprehensive history books in the West.
Englunds bond is an unconventional ruhmeshalle.
His book has the most devastating end that I have ever read in a sachbuch.
I give it no longer ago.
But it is, as he would have in his book this side with the players before the nose weggeschnappt and lit with a streichholz.
