Smart krähen spreads in cities
Many are saatkrähen "problemvögel:" But from the cities the highly intelligent animals no longer drive, experts say.
Which may get rid of them, the other would very quickly. krähen belong to stadtbild for centuries, but many municipalities is mounting anwohnerbeschwerden on dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a tool against the "problemvögel not yet in sight."
Saatkrähen are to get out of the cities no longer, experts said the first krähensymposium in ostfriesischen empty.
Experts from across the bundesgebiet discussed possible ways out there.
They seek alternatives in cities
Conservationists led the problems in cities on the abandonment of the most protected saatkrähen back: the chemieeinsatz in agriculture vernichte increasingly traditional habitats.
The hunt, growing development and the cases of typical brutbäumen made life difficult for the birds.
Krähen are under protection.
Large colonies, with more than 600 brutpaaren including the Westphalian soest, in the northwest, among other things jever, diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
In 2005 had a controversial project to mass killing of krähen caused negativ-schlagzeilen in district.
Critics had the trapping of the animals in vogelfallen described as particularly brutal and beaten with cudgels.
"The normal displacement, the vergrämen, brings" found that the city and landschaftsplaner Werner klöver from empty.
Nests with water wegspritzen or trees, often have undesirable consequences in Baden-Württemberg, the umweltexperte Manfred Emperor from Lahr said.
"soft, large colonies divide on animals and distribute in other places."
Vergrämung is only as a possible exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we do not get them further away."
Without the periphery will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from empty.
There is a combination of vergrämen animals sensitive wohnbereichen and bait advertising to resettle in other places.
"infotafeln instead of chainsaws" camp against the psychologist and ethnologin up Maria jürgens for a completely different way of dealing with the animals, "a pickel best confident on the face, we can finally stand."
Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein had the ascheberger co-founded krähen-lehrpfad where notices about the lives of the highly intelligent saatkrähen information.
The project will already adopted by tourists.
The criticism of the noise of the birds, too, had jürgens opinion: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: saatkrähen benefit not only tools, in order to get a biscuit, but as a tool in their tool even themselves.
Animal behaviorists of the University of Cambridge testeten on four saatkrähen recently, how far the intelligence of the birds is enough.
In an experiment the birds quickly learned that they have to get a structure with stones down, in order to obtain a mottenlarve.
Without much training you purposefully, realised what size and shape a stone needs to have the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt to solve the smart krähen were eager a kniffligeres problem.
Zylinder set in a vertical, the researchers had a small eimerchen with a mottenlarve sets.
With the Schnabel, the birds could not achieve their prey.
However, the researchers had staged drahtstücke them.
It shaped all four animals, a catch, with whose help it eimerchen on control from the röhrchen angelten.
Three of the four saatkrähen, that even offhand.
