At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez jácome mentioned, Secretary of Communications and Transport, before the launch would have confirmed that the pilot, the weather was suitable for the flight.
"The issue that the propellerflügel 25 metres amount lost contact with trees, and the helicopters had the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several bodenkontakte."

He also said that in the investigations in the area where the plane was heruntergekommen, no hubschrauberteile were found.
"In the context of no aeroplane parts to other bodies have been found, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and that is why he met all the requirements for the passengers.
The area has a schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently it is paramount to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, perhaps even a year.
Turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of aeropuertos y achieve auxiliares - Secretariat for aircraft and services in Mexico - that the helicopter went by the Estado Mayor Presidencial The surcharge with reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen on a soft abhang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was at the time of impact to a normal flugoperation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez was jácome, six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation:
Sichtflug:
In line with the flugnormen, it was a flight to the rules of the sichtflugs, which means that the team should have had sufficient point of view during the flight and on the ground.
Weather:
The aicm recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, during the weiterflugs towards the border between Mexico City and the mexiko-staat attracted some deeply some clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds of a lower area with better view in the direction of the cuernavaca-tal had chosen.
Aufprallstelle:
The aufprallkoordinaten and the last radaraufzeichnung of helicopter does not agree, probably before the impact kontrollverlust a deviation from the flugroute on the plane.
Verstreuung of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information until now indicate that the helicopter was from gerader and seitlicher direction aufgeprallt.
The pattern of flugzeugreste now suggest that the helicopter with its unversehrten structure aufgeprallt was on the ground.

The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident can not provide close of fire or explosion.
The recent findings point to a number of bodenkontakte.
In the investigations on the ground were aeroplane parts found at a height of 9200 feet above sea level; the site is abschüssig and has a schrägung of seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is probably gone to break.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several bodenkontakte.
After a minuziösen search in an area that the abgesperrten area at the scene of an accident went further than aeroplane parts now, could not be found, which reinforced the assumption that the unversehrte flugzeugstruktur was against hit the ground.
