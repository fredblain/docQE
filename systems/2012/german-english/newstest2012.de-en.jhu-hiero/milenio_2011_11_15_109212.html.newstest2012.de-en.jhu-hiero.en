The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy, in order that the new government to the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of wirtschaftszusammenbruchs to defy.
A communication from the pr√§sidentschaftspalast announced that appointed Monti is on Sunday would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm to the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats zusammengesetztes Cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will assume office.
Monti said he the president would present the results of the talks with political parties to form a government.
"I want my complete confidence in the ability of our country, to deal with these difficult times, confirm," said the former Commissioner of the journalists.
Monti confirmed does not preclude the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
The "is now well defined," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than normal, while Italy fighting against a political and financial crisis, which has driven the cost of the debt in an intolerable level.
New, the former European Commissioner Mario Monti, the government must adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the europolitikern to restore battered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to rush, the burden on Monti, accelerated by the volatile market, as a result of the Italian government bonds have been burdened with 7 per cent interest rates for 10 years, which is the state, in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma marcegaglia, President of the Italian industrieverbands confindustria told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government after all forces."
We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy emerges from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success, with the support of the party pdl of Silvio Berlusconi, the increased substantially as a result of the crisis had to resign, on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of the Professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said angelino Alfano, Secretary of the central right party.
The support of the Italian pdl, the largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members opposed to a majority of technocrats, Monti is, of whom existing government.
Support from Parliament
Monti's new government probably needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts or delay the reforms could deliver another devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Federation of foreign banks, with his suggestion that a failure of Monti's is a disaster, also pressures.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and business associations and youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday evening, the sitzungsrunde should be completed.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, as the response to the crisis has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government.
After recently revival at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister of the costs for the Italian government bonds reached critical borders.
A bailout of Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, those would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his Government was up to the next election, expected in 2013 will be held, despite the predictions that the politicians take time to implement the reforms, rather than him over the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns regarding the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources suggest that the mutual mistrust and the disagreements between the parties, the inclusion of people from political life is complicated.
