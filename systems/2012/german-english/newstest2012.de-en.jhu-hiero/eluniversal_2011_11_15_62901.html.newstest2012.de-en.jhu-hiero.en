Asphalt of the UNAM schlaglöcher prevented
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with polymeren modified asphalte, in order to make the mix of robust to weather and temperature fluctuations
Would be on the sign, which come from the straßenbelag, respected, there would be no need to repair Nearly 200 000 schlaglöcher, when the rainy season zona Metropolitana del Valle de México - stadtbereich in the valley of Mexico - erupts, said Rafael Herrera nájera, researchers at the university's school of chemistry, FQ to UNAM, warning and assured that if the interpretations and the maintenance of asphaltbelags properly happen, the number of schlaglöcher significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
In his lecture "from a technical point of view," he schlaglöcher held on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with polymeren modified asphalte developing in order to establish a similar mix asphalt, but more mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures in.
Herrera nájera, said that this type of modified asphalte in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and, therefore, to avoid the appearance of schlaglöchern.
He stated that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - is a kohlenwasserstoffverbindung, part of which has a high molekulargewicht - so asphaltene mentioned - and the other part of a low - the 'malthene. Together, they give the straßenbelag his characteristic zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the asphalts means that this is how a liquid is at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees, it is very zähflüssig at 120 degrees and 50 ° C almost note, while it is crumbling at extremely low temperatures.
"This means that the strength of the asphalts on the streets is not gleichförmig, but on a day depending on the weather and temperature fluctuations change ', led the chemieingenieur.
The majority of the FQ researchers noted, the streets of Mexico City have a flexible straßenbelag of six materialschichten zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt included.
Between the top layers is a verschleißschicht asphalt, from small, insisting in asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Every single piece of this verschleißschicht, had been in asphalt gebadet.
If the vehicles travel and forces, will allow this class creates a good kräfteverteilung in straßenbelag.
"If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better," said the chemieingenieur.
"Over the verschleißschicht interpreted," he led, "will be a last layer, known as the tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. from sand, which has also been in asphalt gebadet.
Because of this shift in contact with the tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the verschleißschicht and it must produce friction.
The straßenbelag receives the majority of forces and distributed to the tragschicht also needs a proper thick and the material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions in particular, humidity and temperature changes, further, important factors to be taken into consideration, and above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the verschleißschicht significantly.
If the site is wet, filthy water again in the class and is just difficult. That causes a relaxation of all sections of the surface and as a result, the incidence of schlaglöchern.
When a schlagloch emerge, "he said," First of all, the deckschicht abgetragen affected, while the verschleißschicht then, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that at the first signs by adequate wartungsprogramme should be maintained. "
The member in sistema nacional de Investigadores - system of national innovation of Mexico - said that the fahrzeuglast another important reason for the emergence of schlaglöchern is, so must the thickness of each layer on the surface are always in relation to fahrzeuglast and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent schlaglöchern this arrangement will be adhered to.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that a lot of research on would wait to in other countries, even on asphaltemulsionen, for example, are already on the market, and with which the schlaglöcher simply and without use of high temperatures could fix.
