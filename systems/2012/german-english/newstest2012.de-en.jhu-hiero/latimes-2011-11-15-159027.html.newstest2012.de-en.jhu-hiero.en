Scalia adopts and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the gesundheitsgesetze, a court case
On the day, in which the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the teilende political issue, whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama's gesundheitsgesetze, two of its judges, Antonin scalia and Clarence Thomas, at dinner, the practice has been gesponsort, that will take the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting, to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases handled was a complaint, the 26 states have risen up against the broad reform of health care, which were agreed by Congress last year, a law that was the slogan in the conservative activists across the United States.
The judges agreed with the hearing and is in March, a 5 1/2-stündige grundlagendiskussion expected, probably the result will probably boost the präsidentschaftskampf 2012, at a time when the decision is made public, will be in full swing.
The lawyer, in court and argue that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, once attorney under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements Chancellery, Bancroft pllc, was one of the nearly two dozen companies, the annual dinner of the federalist society, an ancient group, which covers the defence of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which represents the dinner has sponsored, Jones day, one of the associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, the contest the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc., financially in the outcome of the process is hugely involved.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among other things, Mitch McConnell fraktionschef of the Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health
The guests of the dinners? scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit events to the federalist society for years.
And it is not against moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judge ruled.
If they were, they would probably fall under 4C principle of the Code, which says: "A judge can participate in benefizveranstaltungen law near and other organizations, with the judges no spokesman, guest of honor or according to the programme should not be guest of such events."
Nevertheless scalia ranged the Extreme proximity and Thomas to two of the has passed in connection with the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, in order to alert moral-und-regierungsaktivisten.
"The startling break with morality and The contrast with The Code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the Court is by the same rules that apply to all other federal judge ruled," said Bob Edgar, president of common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"won the judges and dinnierten during a benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings on court."
Its performance and its support for a spendenaktion for this event undermine any claim to be impartial and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics, who say they are gerichtsangelegenheit too easily with groups which are guided by the agenda, such as the federalist society, mix.
And Thomas' wife ginni is a known conservative activist.
The Conservatives claim, however, that it was Judge Elena Kagan, a moral problem was not scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was generalstaatsanwältin under the Obama administration, when the first gesetzesanfechtungen came before the court in the first instance.
Its critics Kagan pressed to withdraw themselves from hearing the case because of bias, as they become very involved in the defence of the law is to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
