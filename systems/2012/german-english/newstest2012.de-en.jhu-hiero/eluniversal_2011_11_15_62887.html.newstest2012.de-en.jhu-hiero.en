MSS ushers in a forschungsprotokoll for the location of the gene for obesity
You Social Security Fund Mexico leads to a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by the IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro social - IMSS - Social Security Fund Mexico announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" is, with the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación médica en bioquímica - Department for medical research, focus Biochemie - to the clinic hospital de especialidades del centro médico Nacional Siglo XXI, said that a interdisziplinäres team, consisting of doctors, krankenpflegern, ernährungsspezialisten and social workers was built.
This team will be supported by specialists and students from the postgraduiertenstudiengangs on Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública - Insp - and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios avanzados - cinvestav del Instituto politécnico Nacional in IPN.
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can come to Sports of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 p.m. carried out tests on children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sportplatz Cuauhtémoc - in west of the state of México - began in the sportplatz of nezahualcóyolt, and since the October 8 in the east of the state of México will continue.
If the target of 500 to 600 untersuchungspersonen is reached, the study will have the sportplatz of Independencia, in the south of the hauptstadtbezirks continued and on the Morelos, in the north of the hauptstadtbezirks concluded.
He explained that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the World Day of diabetes, he said it is going to three thousand children and young people under the age of six to 14 years with the agreement and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family krankheitsvorgeschichte to risk factors that could lead to diabetes or niereninsuffizienz, to control.
He also that in these samstagen led the untersuchungspersonen, weight, size, taillenumfang, measured their blood pressure controlled, and blutwerte as the glukosespiegel, triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors - attempt the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity were determined.
Cruz López stressed that investigation would at the concerns of the health workers conducted on the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The gesundheitsumfragen from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, the proportion of obese boys by 77%, and the girls with obesity have increased by 47% and obesity has increased dramatically," the specialist of the IMSS stressed.
He was, the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico from the other peoples differences.
It was that A - E - Mexicans - in - on average to indianisch-amerikanischer, 65 per cent to 5 per cent to 30 per cent of European and African descent is what is in the genes, which are associated with diabetes and obesity reflects.
In general, he said, the genetics of obesity am in the inability to put the surplus of US Energy - calories to burn, so this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the put research participants is a comprehensive study of the children, found in the dignity, whether it is a degree of obesity or obesity showed.
It would even the dark hautfalten occur in the nacken and innenarm - akanthosis, which highlight the likelihood of stoffwechselstörungen and diabetes in the preliminary stage, is investigating.
All of the information would be kept confidential and explain to the parents in writing by the doctors and the doctors told the parents of all the values of and are proposing changes to the way of life to you, the prevention of diseases are appropriate.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors, which are responsible for overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: exercise, which means a lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day on the television and transport short routes to go on foot to be used instead.
The high kalorienaufnahme, which means that increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and kohlenhydraten - tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc. - combined with a High fat and eiweißaufnahme and genetics to be analysed in this project.
