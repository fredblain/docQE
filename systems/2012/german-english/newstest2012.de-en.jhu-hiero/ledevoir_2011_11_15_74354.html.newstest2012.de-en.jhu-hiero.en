Euthanasia and begleiteter freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, as evidenced by a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The body, said that governments, healthcare institutions, and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment for the best schmerzlindernden money, and on the cancer beyond.
The Canadian Society lives in a state of death.
Only 9% of Canadians are really point to talk with their doctors about conditions under which they would die and make operation for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, was involved in the six experts in various disciplines, including Ethics, Law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body, the Government recommends changes to the Penal Code so to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients, which are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude EIU the experts cite a recent survey by the independent society, the erdballes had compared the todesqualität in 40 countries.
Although Canada has placed it in the 10th grade, the study noted that "The Medical sterbebetreuung in Canada, has led to a culture in which people are afraid to tackle the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers means, tell us the Royal Society of Canada ordered experts.
And despite the majority of Canadians desire to die at home, however, die eventually 68,6% of those in hospital.
The whole country terms, the rate seen in hospital with 86% of sterbefällen highest in Quebec.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, want to make any changes to the Penal Code on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, entgegengerichtet.
But now there are, according to the experts, the gleichermaβen all those countries inspected, the approach of legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or use, have no proof that such a decriminalisation miβbräuche in their application, praxisdurchführung of euthanasia or begleitetem unkompetenten or not consenting persons would lead to suicide.
On the contrary find it far more cases of breaches in the countries in which euthanasia and begleiteter suicide are not legalised, as yesterday Jocelyn downie, a signatory of the report in a teleconferencing confirmed.
"Euthanasia is illegal in Canada, where they will clearly, practised."
"begleiteter suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that, according to a angus-reid-umfrage already carried out in 2010 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert, as they are of the opinion that this would have had people at the end of their lebensweges to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue did not lead to the legalisation of euthanasia, to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people besäβe worth less.
In terms of people who already have done an assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents are of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to maintain or suspension of funding in patients, situation is less clear, as the author of the report.
As this in their empfehlungsverzeichnis suggests that ought to be indicated in the Penal Code that sell the available resources, for which a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal.
The Panel of Experts also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task, sell a funds at the end of life to be respected, and that without having to fear prosecution.
The body, said that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment for the best schmerzlindernden money, and on the cancer beyond.
Least asks that the body already in the Canadian institutions for healthcare in the extensive means used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender maβnahmen, consider this, at least, as these as little as euthanasia intended to reduce physical pain and they are on the same procedure bezögen.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts on the territory of health care have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada expertenberichts.
Council Pierre Deschamps, expert in gesundheitsrecht, among other things, the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts, described as "extremely" as they euthanasiepraxis in patients in the end have no borders.
"This opens the doors to a situation in which everyone, lebensmüde and older than 18 years, a different person to ask, to help him in his suicide," Council Deschamps, who had studied a summary of the report yesterday.
Council Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to put the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social gewirke society.
But now, he says, were "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist for gesundheitsrecht, has "expressed a strong resistance" from the conclusions of the report, as titulierte "pro-euthanasie-manifest."
Margaret Somerville either, which is itself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, especially the berichtsangaben regarding the nichtvorliegens abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and begleiteter suicide legalised, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
