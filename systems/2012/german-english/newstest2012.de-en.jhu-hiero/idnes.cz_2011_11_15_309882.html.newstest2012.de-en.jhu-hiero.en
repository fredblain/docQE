V need for steroids: "The run" - the illegal race across America
Rezension
The original reckless journey through a series of completely preventable, dilettantischer failures to routinefahrt frühschicht.
Managed to fulfil the ambitions, in large part, but what use is that, if was obviously no one wants to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the ladentische, inspired the new part, with the subtitle "The run 'high expectations.
He promised, however, the bejahrte spieleserie "need for steroids" Back to postpone a step into a new dimension and the spielbaren really demonstrationsbeispielen, he seemed to be not only one of many action-rennspielen.
We were also curious as to how the eingepassten passages, in which the hauptprotagonist be rising out of the car and on foot to continue.
But in the end as it is already used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
Sure - potentially quite decent arkade-rennen but overall will detract from some unnecessary errors in the game of this series are present more or less for a couple of years.
So it is not really a mistake but more signs of incomprehensible laziness of the spieleentwickler in principle.
The adventure begins very well.
Once the story will be introduced, whose hauptfigur Jack has some problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, it is the steering wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
The idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and in more than 50 individual race.
This means that every race will be fought on other route and the various stages in different is sufficiently different and interesting environment to take place.
At no time was the impression that game would always offer the same again.
Some areas are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of grafik not beyond the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing weltbewegendes.
But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Sometimes atypical elements of a little change in the individual race.
IN THE DESERT, for example, we will be surprised by a desert storm, which seriously limits point of view.
In the mountains, in turn, has to be extremely careful that it is not of a landslide buried.
Incidentally, are fairly well built on the individual race.
While only a few, but they are.
A while so people are trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents, in principle, a classic race, you have time to catch up - classic race against the stoppuhr, then expected a a personal match with a single opponent.
And this is also the police, which have the whole thing to blow.
A novelty passages, which Jack out of the car.
It is more about certain interactive animationen, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players away to the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as we would expect, specifically only three.
Ultimately, this is the thing is more likely to have the advantage, because this element has at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the above one of the elements that make the game abwechslungsreicher.
The fahrmodell is in the previous fußtapfen parts.
This means that from today's point, it is not seen Trees, on the other hand, you could not say that it would be bad.
Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But a aktionsgeladenen rennfahren the European fahrmodell will also continue to do quite well, even though the competition could find better.
Until then, has everything so well.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
In contrast to the fahrmodell is kollisionsmodell does not quite OK
A game of this nature is hardly calculated to expect it complicated deformationen and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object idea, how the car is, it is clearly not everything is in order.
Typical example: the close or vorbeifahren to overtake oncoming cars "touches" only slightly, try the other in places in other, almost identical situation but it comes into slings and is wild pirouetten.
Or the karre is equal to scrap.
Thanks to the restart-systems makes it no more, annoying is it anyway.
The restarts are resolved, when you have destroyed or remote ends up the route, it raises the game back to the last indication of the route.
It has only five restarts only in each race.
If they have exhausted, Everything is from the lot.
The restarts are something like rather a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but it is hard to leave it.
Sometimes does not help time restart, it is nothing less than the critical section to learn from the head.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some trends must be crossed in a very specific way, for example, otherwise you simply does not.
Elsewhere, met in the appropriate place "civilian" cars is in the same configuration, irrespective of whether the first or fifth, five seconds earlier, or a minute later.
This is annoying, especially in situations when you see that the kontrahent a easily two oncoming cars until you even get away, but there is, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or brakes.
And it does n't matter when it comes, everything is designed so that such a situation is always close to their nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where we are being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again, regardless of the time.
The verrücktesten is the conclusion of the game in the long bridge, the head happens.
The kontrahent must overtake here, obviously, on devil come out.
And if it is already time A, then of course it makes a point of view, so they drive their own car a couple of times in Klump initially.
Clear - they want the game simply exciting and are more exciting but the intention is clear, they quickly the joy of the game vermiest.
Be sold and that is a shame because, despite a simpler fahrmodell entertaining and some aktionsgeladen, overall the game is right that there is almost no longer know, where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what "blame" - the concept of 50 unique routes, the organisation of the race in a way that can not raise boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is the wagenwechsel during the race.
We should not overlook the stations on the road, because you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that they are.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousinen to draft the motorways and exotic super-sportwagen for the technical operations, for example, on the serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the modus spielgeschichte is also the aufgaben-modus challenges - so the race in each of the lokalitäten, which we know from history.
There is not only to win medals, but also erfahrungspunkte for its profile, which together for the tasks of challenges and history.
To get to higher fahrerniveau, have various items: the car started to be open to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is at the same time as the online-funktion autolog to which, among other things, its own results achieved compared with those of other players and also provides for more collective functions.
One of more incomprehensible schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here we come: with the car in a u-bahn-tunnel - nay, where one in the dark on the long RAST seemed as well.
Look at the tacho paragraphs between 150 a 200 km / h - nay, but that is at once to scrap from behind a subway and drives a uncompromising.
In our editors we will still argue about whether this was a blackout of the spielgestalter or whether the authors for blöd.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall in the majority of cases are agreeable and even brilliant here and there.
Even more galling is that some of bildwiederholfrequenz slows exciting times, and sometimes quite dramatic.
The concerns, however, especially the greater number of accidents involved, where a steady FPS nothing good.
The tonwiedergabe is as far as OK and the soundtrack geschmackssache.
In an effort to raise a rather young audience as broad as possible scale, created a soundtrack a lá "of any" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall need for steroids: the run? the feelings are more mixed.
If the game would not detract from the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors, we have with the brustton convinced able to claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But in fact, the game somehow unfertig.
To a class of pleasure, but you should be prepared that these errors with the power of flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye.
