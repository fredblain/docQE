The world gemäβ Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rivalisieren simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, and support for Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America complex world with simple, not to say: simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters of their donnernden declarations and statements on the auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, repeatedly reported.
On China, Iran and the israel-hilfe fall - often in no way has underpinned - slogans.
Of the about the appointment of the "Grand old party" can Mitt Romney threatened the most valued Chinese quote to the WTO, and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in America, by the exodus of entire industries to Asia to äuβerste gereizt - accuse.
Gone stupid if this should lead to the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama, and one candidate who seems to have a mature vision of auβenpolitik, has nearly about his emotions schmeichelnden conduct of the air abgeschnürt.
He had called for a robust but constructive gesprächsaustausch with Beijing - also Obama's current position.
But Huntsman will not heard, because in the depths of the opinion polls, he stops.
Reagan's image
Romney also had military strikes against Iran, if the sanctions to stoppung praised the nuklearprogrammes should fail.
"If I am elected, areas I had the Iran stop," he getönt.
"Obama is reelected, you get the Bomb."
Auβerdem, he has promised to help Israel increased military and Obama accused commitments to have been guilty of this partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain zweithöchst platzierter candidate, is itself a shameful aktenunkenntnis for show.
Recently he called for, to give the Chinese militärbedrohung versus that Beijing "attempts to develop a nuclear" - and seemed auβer account of the fact that China is already since 1964 in possession of military atomarwaffen.
The Texas governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, äuβert itself, to be prepared, in Mexico against drug cartels in the American army service.
Obama the 2009 banned use of foltermaβnahmen to mutmaβlichen terrorists was also supported by Cain, Perry and kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current präsidentschaftskontrahenten to Reagan, too, was simple ideas and had nevertheless won the Cold War.
They call in the memory, that Obama was selbstein amateur and water had to pay on the subject of anti-terrorist was in his wine.
You are right to insist on the failure of his naïve, zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "Boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he also moved the reputation of the weakness.
But this anfeindung is not quite so ungezwungen.
The population estimates more positive assessment of the national security under Obama, bin Laden has eliminated.
Since the Iraq you not military intervention, which lead to reduced.
And Obama surprised by adequate, he argues that America should be rebuilt economically, to new life to his leadership.
