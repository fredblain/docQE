Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed the previous Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, and so he triggered a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon's to the kriegsschauplätzen in Afghanistan and civilian fließbändern.
The Pentagon already carefully cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts by $600 trillion or more will be necessary, if Congress can not reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress in reaching an budgetvereinbarung, which will lead to the seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out on such unthinking way that would make the most of our shipping and construction unworkable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernisierungsbemühungen severely damaged," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily separated from a large part of our civilian staff to and, because the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly beurlauben civilians, in order to achieve the objective."
"These amendments would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our concentration."
The cuts were ultimately make the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"during the kriegszeitkontingente are not directly affected by the seizure in the fight against terror, the serious interference in the grundbudget would negatively affect the kriegsbemühungen," Panetta warned.
"recruitment have been cut, leading to delays in the attitudes and the einstellungsaufsicht, in support of the war, would lead."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments on kriegszeithändler would be disrupted and the legal and political support."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts to the Defense Ministry.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defence Ministry would launch a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian Act," the senators said in a joint statement published on Monday afternoon, as they panettas letter.
"This is a result that we can not live with, and it is certainly suggest that we should none."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United are providing and their defence should not be allowed."
If panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will strengthen demands, exempt the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta increasingly outspoken the possibility of cuts, even though it many years has experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the Pentagon's top, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense malte might face a bleak picture, which - with a military shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is a luftwaffengeschwader without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to meet the mission," said Panetta in his inaugural address in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morals and concentration is and is not in a position to start it with potential opponents."
"It is a really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details, such as Reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, our global operational and eingreiffähigkeit serious restrictions which leads to an unacceptable risk in future kriegsoperationen."
And Panetta said that some of the largest verteidigungsprojekte could fall victim to the removal, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
To this list also includes the fighter pilots f35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombenflugzeug, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new bodenkampffahrzeug, the army and navy, need to replace the Humvee.
It would stop the further development and testing of the f35, it would save up to $80 billion over the next 10 years, but the advocates say that it is an important next step in arming, so that risks posed by China and other opponents can be overcome.
