As a result of vote to choose the CDU proposes that the EU President
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats, or CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor, and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has pushed through by the autumn, especially to those activists to provide enough, the Italian Government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly tomorrow see as too lax.
The proposed European Commission präsidentschaftsantrag was adopted almost unanimously by the Bureau.
In 1001 delegates had just nine voted against, 10 had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasted several minutes, on the basis of their interventionserlässen First, Angela Merkel, and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three europa-zugeneigten finance ministers were no doubt open.
The Chancellor has hauptidee - as well as the antrage following slogan: The answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on budget policy of countries in the euro zone, but it could also come in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of popular vote lead, "in order to give Europe a face."
In any case, this is one of the antragsvorschläge passed by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: groβ-britannien is opposed to the matter, and the Chief of the CDU to know, believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone is placed.
As the delegates in an overwhelming majority of the proposal of the weighting of each country in the ezb-vorstand according to the weighting of individual economies, which seems to be a erstarkung rejected by Germany's position would.
The Chancellor has therefore concerned about calming the climate within their party the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she has not tried to stepping up its Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulties to win, critics of the arrogant Germany would immediately.
As far as the europa-antrag the significance of "Our friendship" paragraph to France, Angela Merkel is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it reminds that Leipzig two centuries ago, was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
