Del Valle, which lacked the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?

El Valle gets its 14 misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the Crown for Miss Colombia.
This time was Melina Ramírez serna content, on to the gewinnerpodium, a silberkrone and demonstrated the bond that you as the new Miss Colombia, for show.
In Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico with the result that night received the Crown and the zeder in itself, is the Departamento on 14 misstitel and Melina joining the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had kept the crown almost in the hands. misses include: Miriam ospina proclaimed to the Benoit, 1947, Clara Domínguez borrero - 1949, Patricia Bellini Ayala, 1979, Lorena Alvarez, of 1981, Rose Mary alzate of 1983, Olga María arenas - 1987, Leila blanque - 1988 - Mónica Evers - 1989, María Consuela Pinedo - 1990, Diana Isabel Romero 1993, Giselle Garcés aljure - 2000, Catalina Giraldo 2007, Stephanie Garcés aljure in 2008.
The big question today, many are asking is: what is missing?
Because the result is the demise of a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to make the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain to Queen of the police and the mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, title, including the schönheitsköniginnen taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial for the jury's decision to appoint the first Miss, is that it has the answer to the question "What book you most and why?," which affects their Martín Murillo Gómez from the carreta literaria leamos had been raised, was not convinced.
The young woman in Valle del Cauca replied to the author:
"I read a lot, I think quite the literature, I believe it is a way to civilise, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood, 'der small Prince ', a deep book.
Today, I read'schuld and Punishment, "and it is a book of universal culture that we all should read, I read a book by Irene nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, The'leidenschaften '.
One MET with little gegenliebe, firstly because of'sich civilise 'and, secondly, because they do not have a real, had declared how each of her book she had influenced. "
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "The universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people, read a bit'den please small prince, "and it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the love of El Valle ausgebrannt.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that it was the favourite, all of which beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices, gastronomie-wettbewerb OSTER, publikumsabstimmung the best handgeschneiderte kostüm and Reina Madre, "had made the other candidates jealous, is what the Queen stresste and therefore could not shine on the stage."
And it said its first presentation to the swimming suit on the beach of the hilton-hotels and their two lifts in the krönungsfeier.
Although they appeared in two sure, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en Casa," the channel RCN argued that the fact that Melina on has been crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate during the competition, the most of the prices not queen wins, after all."
Valle was also out of the way - a mistake at the end of the press.
Another hypothesis is that Valle, the jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not convince the essentials of the National schönheitswettbewerbs.
It will have its reason for two days before the creation of the international jury, Lucy Doughty said they were a woman, the dedication to their country's Social Affairs.
"Beauty is not enough for a Miss Colombia; you have on the physical hinausschauen and focus on the social experience, that is to say, that they had worked on projects before participating in the competition," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle, with its defects of the derriere and fibrosis, be it in the magengegend said, had sinned. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for'natürliche beauty 'with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body that there is better, "but the problem is with the fibrosis in the stomach for me frankly unlikely to notice was given, expressed their marks on the last day."
Meanwhile, the magazine is the journalist Guido Hoyos of cromos believe that the mistakes of the Valle del Cauca woman was the surgery, which they had submitted to.
"The operations are OK, but should Valle did not know how they can get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and this is where she had to pay. "
Because of this prize, which will be the first time the national beauty contest, emerged after the appearance in the swimming suit a cruel forecast, which was in the night, there should be true. getuschelt, that had been raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they do not benefit from the Crown.
Regardless of whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their herrschaftsjahr office, not as Queen, but as a princess, a position the opportunity on appointment of the national schönheitswettbewerbs Colombia to represent one of the international competitions.
It is a one of the queens, however, which, despite its overwhelming auftritts, Cartagena escaped the crown was to go down in history.
