Mission ended, Congress prepared to communicate with regard to Libya
It finally looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington have to agree on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of the American interference.

Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be willing to take action is now.

The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly, more than 150 proposed changes every two years, the figures, which the senatsbibliothek available.
But they were not much better than the current.
Add the last change that is the 27th, was ratified in 1992, has already been 1789 but actually proposed to Congress.
