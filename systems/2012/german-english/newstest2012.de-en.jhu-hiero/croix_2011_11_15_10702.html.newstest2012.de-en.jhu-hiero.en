Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is designed to provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gasriese Gazprom wanted to make this event with glamour and Gloria.
Loaded more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State and Government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, orchesterbeschallung and feinschmeckerbuffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly.
Mrs Merkel the German Chancellor, the Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, the French prime minister, François Fillon, and his counterpart mark rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together the steering wheel of the ventils films, which Russian gas transported to Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through a first of 1.224 km pipeline, linking the St. Petersburg region with Pomerania, delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, a gesamtlieferung from 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total - allowed, should be completed in the end of 2012.
And it is already the eventuality of the construction of a third leadership to distance ourselves full capacity.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this huge bauwerkes as a victory.
The project has been highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct flow of gas to Germany, and in order to prevent any trassenverlaufs through third countries - Poland or Ukraine on the land transit.
For this reason, these two countries lose some of its power, it will now be more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia to contract by threatening access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, was not be avoided, the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen Pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin, to compare the occupation of Poland in the years 1939.
This means that the subject of äuβerst politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
This, however, at the expense of entkräftung European energy, because the project has beaten a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has it ready in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gasverbrauche and their gas tend to go through.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new arterie that unites us in organic way," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, by pointing out to what extent the groβen gasverträge are also important from a political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile of the gazprom-manager in lubmin many on the gaszuleitung.
The construction of the gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The unterwasserleitung consists of steel with betonummantelung to protect them from schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed, in roughly 200 metres deep.
Their construction needed to datierenden minefields be avoided from the Second World War.
"around there were hundreds of mines had to be cautiously removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, Nord Stream, spokesman of the society.
Auβerdem increased maβnahmen had to be taken to protect the flora and fauna.
The line is a long queue of metal, eiffeltürme difficult as 242, which is more than the entire length interrupted by nothing: neither by outlets, wartungsstationen.
A kontrollplattform was off the coast of Sweden is planned, but the project developers distance yourself from it, as the Swedes have little were keen, a Russian staatsgesellschaft in a permanent way to size of their coasts to settle.
"In the event of an accident contract we gasdurchlass, Jens refined Müller in less than one minute."
In the event of a leak entweicht the gas in the air that is in the pipeline.
This case is konstrukteuren than just considered unlikely, however, as the schweiβnähte was estimated at a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.
Monitoring by the state of the pipeline will be guaranteed by a unterwasser-roboter to external observationszwecken seeschiff frame, as well as by circulating a device in the heart of the gas pipeline.
It has the form of zigarre, miβt introduced a metre diameter, the home of the pipeline and moved on from the gasdruck.
After three full days of movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, is the device in his arrival of detailed information on possible deformationen of metal.
The pipeline was designed to work for 50 years, without the slightest to undergo repairs.
The gaszirkulation will simply guaranteed under pressure.
This is 200 bar in the zutritts- 100 bar in the austrittsstelle.
Five companies combine their efforts to implement this project.
The leitungsführung, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Here the German companies are also attached to E. on and BASF, as ever, be 15,5%, as well as the Dutch gasunie and the French firmengruppe GDF Suez - ever to 9%.
These five companies have formed an unternehmensgemeinschaft, called the Nord Stream and which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It also has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly good.
Then this society the entire capacity of their gastransportes Gazprom has hired out together on renewable zwanzig-jahres-vertrag.
"Gazprom will pay for the capacity, regardless of how groβ real transportiere, Jens refined Müller is gasmenge."
The financing of the gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and to 70% covered by bank loans.
The cost of Labour as a whole should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability has been transferred.
The gas pipeline is on a sandy, with kiefern wooded küstenstrich lubmin from the Baltic Sea to light.
The 4.5 metres high are the gasaustrittspforte outlets.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, before this is conveyed in the German gasfernleitungen who arrive.
Since last Tuesday of the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per verstreichende hour.
At full capacity it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, and 6 million in 2012.
