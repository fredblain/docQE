Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Of Nicolas Sarkozy, the immigration policy has been criticised for many corners - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to the figures submissive policy, the reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," such as France had call themselves.
Recently had the harassment directed at foreign students of administrative side, the Interior Minister had marked the wochenschauen incidental - see Libération on 23 May - announced that France "have no talent, bricklayers or waiter from abroad need."
But this policy was seldom analysis from the economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.
From right side was the stance of Jacques Chirac, 1976, had declared that "900, 000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrierte labour, no problem for a country should be" left side by Michel Rocard, 1990, had said France "could not include the whole of poverty in the world."
One difference is the level of groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005, both from the right and from the left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden on the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent of the groβzügigkeit, one for immigrants is willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in his program on banalities that point out, partnership development, we want our 'migration problems to solve. "
This vision of immigration as a burden, as a problem, however, may affect the elections; it is economically costly.
As all the economists Ian aware of Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which summarises the latest findings on immigration, exceptional people: how migration shaped our world and will define our future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S., exists below the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the einwandererflut on economic growth, wages and jobs in the destination.
The limit immigration would deny and damage the employment market growth.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified to replaced, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that in fact the immigrants are much complementary than the local lohnarbeiter, as they schwerpunktmäβig professions in sectors to the arbeitsplatztechnisch unausgelastet.
The low skilled immigrants working in sectors, domestic lohnarbeiter put little charms, the higher quality among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the training is not the arbeitsangebot aligned.
Positive lohneffekt
A surgeon would have problems, as well as to work in a country, where there is a lack of anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants, so is a positive effect of einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic employment situation.
Giovanni peri, calculated in this way, a 1% -iger in the einwandererflut a miteinbezogene, long term increase in wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of the ideenschöpfung tabled by the immigrants and is conducive to the economic growth - a high proportion naturalized immigrants from under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants.
The migrants also have net the systems, in European countries, on average for a total amount of 1% of the entire budget.
The weltarbeitsorganisation estimates, for example, that a einwandernde person the public budget to Germany at the age of 30 years on average, his life is a net contribution brings in revenue minus expenditure of about 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of schnittpunkte bring about "with the teeth."
This said teeth, which would shock the immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect.
