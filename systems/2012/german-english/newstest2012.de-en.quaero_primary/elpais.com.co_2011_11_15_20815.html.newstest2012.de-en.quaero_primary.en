This was the work of the doctor, who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali as the man who "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials plays a key role.
On 4 November, a Lophoskopist the investigative unit of the Public prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) confirmed: "Alfonso Cano" by comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI, this week Eliazar González on-call time, a man from Puerto Tejada for 21 years is cooperating in criminal investigations and proceedings.
At the beginning of his career working in communities of Chocó, where he had to go often five days in the jungle to reach the place where the bodies were found, he should identify.
2000 siedelte after Valle on and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie, which is the investigation of the skin is exposed to the friction, i. e. the hand and foot.
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar pointed out, put clothes for at least three days.
Great things expected of him.
Friday night he flew in the helicopters from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that there was a suspicion that the man who had guided the oldest guerrilla in the world, and that is why he should Guillermo León Zehnfinger-Abdruckblatt Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached with the Untersuchungste the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the images he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a Pflanzkelle and a pocket lamp Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the vote.
He was right: it was "Alfonso Cano."
The same night was responsible for this man from Puerto Tejada for the defence minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to say that it was the head of the FARC.
In the track
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was that the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano ," very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a criminal offence.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
In their arrest, many criminals are false identity papers or they do not.
We are taking fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to grab a theft of a piece of wall from a house, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this point, with his hand when he stuffed with jewelry and money herauszog safe.
"The walls are difficult, because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprinting, but in this case, we have been able to take the shot in the hand and the offender, who had participated in several thefts, identify," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be relieved or contaminated.
Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and a fingerprint actually agreed on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that the murderer, but he will be the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI stated that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen were taken away from the object."
If they appear, a Pflanzkelle or a band will be used for the carriage.
After that, the prints are sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without papers," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as it is not all gold that glitters is not everything it touches, a fingerprint.
But it can be used if an appropriate comparison.
