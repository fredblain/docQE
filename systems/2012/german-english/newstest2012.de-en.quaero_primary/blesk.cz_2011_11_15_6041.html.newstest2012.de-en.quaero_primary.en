Darina Rychtářová over their forsaking Gatten:
Iveta - this donkey can keep you, I do not want him more!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now is over.
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), their lover, Darina still hope that Josef from his rosy dream and come home.
But it is now, finally, with the patience and for the life she has clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtáová singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she would probably not even dream, like that with her husband.
As Iveta at their urging, after 30 days and back to Říčany, Josef was the same.
Indeed, he confessed publicly that they love.
At the time Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her relinquishing man - but it gave him the sack.
Rychytář it does not matter, with whom his wife is sleeping
If Rychtář Iveta Bartošová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not open arms.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide its days in our common home, then I will not chase him."
"It is not to be loved, strays old donkey, but as a person, and I still have some ties," Mrs Rychtářová betrayed; but they also said that she had separated from him emotional and insist on mutual decency.
The fact that he Darina the back door locked, Josef has so far with dignity.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I stand with Iveta, nothing will change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company is ongoing, I am concerned about the repairs, the garden, I make purchases."
"With Darina I am quite normal, only the bed we do not share," said J. Rychtář (leaf) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, then he would not prevent them.
"We do not sleep with each other, so I don't care whether she has a friend or who it is.
It is clear to me that this is my fault, I was in love with Iveta and therefore I accept any responsibility.
