EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has upset the balance among the various institutions felt out the road."
I would not have expected that there is such a hard war flares. "
"It will take five or six years, until the dust settling, and all have become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, its presentation at the law faculty.
How seriously the motto, "this is understandable and openly about Europe," it has already been demonstrated in the first part of her speech, in which it was the various institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a clear and understandable way to describe some editor of the law faculty of Charles University would have been able to.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy.
"Initially, there was criticism that he is too low-key - a grey civil servant, such a role, but I must say that it has ended up all the time, how well he has taken up the cause.
"It is a man of twenty-seven member states listen patiently to communicate with them, and above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security policy, said that the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number, I call? "as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also on the agenda, according to the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
According to the Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
In the case of the government during the presidency, describing it as a big negative, which severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said that it was not only in the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet overcome quite hectic.
And since the seven-year budget must be approved by the EU, which is precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and economical budget, what industries take precedence, which countries more and less - all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."
"If I do not like something, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether they are really in Brussels curved or round cucumbers and other large bananas or whether someone really wants to ban the Quargel.
It would have used the territory of the European Union in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
The Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics more negative than positive aspects of the story.
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, they also have the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian comes to me and, in the vicinity, then the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is the heads together - that is your V4? "and makes a pretty sour face.
Mrs Vicenové according to expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute encourages cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries should work together, and it does not want to out."
"It will be more and more of these institutions, which at the end of a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "expects Mrs Vicenová.
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
