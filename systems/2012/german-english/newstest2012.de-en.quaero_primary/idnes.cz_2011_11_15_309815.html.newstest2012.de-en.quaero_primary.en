Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten, I had a little bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the start.
Since I was not in the least, what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place ."
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course is on Saturdays and Sundays, it is full.
This time we debated with director Alena (the rate is not a single man), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And that is, after all, most of us.
Some people have a short neck, the other a young figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to extend the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got pointers about how to make a Frauentyp like Jennifer Lopez - with a large bosom, wide hip and all slim waists - and attracts figur stressed, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and hips is so great that the skirt or trousers does not really fit, should be at least a piece of schneidern.
This will not regret, because good clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar, the high and verrutscht Taille absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week time I will do everything thoroughly.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve in view of the assigned homework.
Each of the rate of a celebrity, for which it is to devise appropriate attire - day clothes and evening gown.
So we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and Figurtyp.
I am supposed to Miranda Kerr ," "you may be out of the campaign, Victoria Secret.
Inside, I juble, because it is much better for me personally, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has grown in recent times, the hundred kilograms (okay, that is a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes we are supposed to from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then represented graphically.
"In the Mood Board, the result is known, then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist models not only physically, but also the so-called product side in the journal (after specific target, for example, handbags, coats, etc.).
They told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist must have a good overall picture.
With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture was tempered by three visitors from the industry.
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it.
And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
You can take, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, paragraph shoes to attract and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up our sleeves and and the whole look is quite different.
"So," he said.
But most came the following advice: "first of all, you know what the rules are perfect."
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we need pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if you fashion journals often quite different to see.
Not to mention of fashion schaus.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist much more clothing variant must have prepared than he ultimately photographed.
So you have to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) to stylen at least 15.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
All of this must be expected in the form of the attire.
That image and sometimes make up half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
Since you need only Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a Stylisten rather reserved.
Well-known personalities, it is often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I turned out secondary).
And if anyone stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different (smaller) size than he or she needs in reality.
Then you need only turn to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, the appropriate Promi or decreased, and so on.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth "to assemble them."
In his work, above all, he needs to communicate with the people, he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
People judge without curry and his opinion.
"If we have in order to sift through their clothes cupboard and to complement fine pieces, then we cannot get rid of the whole storage cupboard and say - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few worthy things, which recommends what you can do," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "pocket" must include.
So a bag of Taille zuknöpft and which carries all the necessary Proprietäten.
But such clear, such as scissors, Abroller to hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread (the Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or hats), specific clips with which the clothes will be accelerated if it is too big (electric nadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
This means that we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to get it right.
In the photography studio, where the floor is, you can damage the shoe base, let alone the outside.
O klebten us and we klebten....
With the gap should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So we must be really well.
Mario enjoyed, he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The skill is not just my strength.
All of this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second Wochenend-Fortsetzungskurs.
One thing is now clear to me - the styling at professional level, is no pushover.
