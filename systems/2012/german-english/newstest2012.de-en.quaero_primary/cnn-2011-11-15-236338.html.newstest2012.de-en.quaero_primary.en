Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts of $450 trillion dollars over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion or more will be needed if the Congress can reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of the Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% across-the-board cuts, as well as a halt numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a way that would make most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously harm," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to be able to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference would adversely affect the war effort in the budget," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment has been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which leads to late payments to dealers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she Panettas letter published.
"This is a result that we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will strengthen demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces difficult choices.
At a press conference in the last week, the defence minister, painting a gloomy picture, which could face a military shell, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to compete with potential opponents."
"You can be angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global commitment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
And Panetta said that some of the removal of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list also includes Fighter planes F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new litt oral combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 trillion dollars, but supporters say that it can be an important next step in the buildup, so that the possible dangers posed by China and other opponents.
