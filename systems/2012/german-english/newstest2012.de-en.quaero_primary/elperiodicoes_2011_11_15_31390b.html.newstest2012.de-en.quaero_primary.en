Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the middle of the 1980s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the administration published its Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the sinking of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who does not spreading in the south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas as a natural park is playing with this idea.
As a model is now no longer the Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was when the city in September, a giant, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola.
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone has to make gates in the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue on which two members of the old eingesessenen caste, who meet in the lift.
And it is precisely this fact provides the for one of the rare similarities between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "front of the mountains," as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, green apples, has not been resolved.
"It should be based on the principle that is Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect, for which the title" gates of Collserola lexikalische "" lexikalische trap ": it must not "as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge" that "the number of risks."
Dangers arising from the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the area of the forum "swan song."
The first fear is his own limits on what can be developed.
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e. to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [references to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, closer to the question, says simplified, the side of Collserola, in the direction of Valle sana, "can be understood as a park, not at Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol reminds us that there is already a study from the Patronat de Collserola, which is not "fallen on deaf ears," even though the city council is grateful that his body has given the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment."
He also notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, even though he his "doubts" whether this technical profile created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says)," we architects should only be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tender conditions a global view of Collserola: "there have been advertised 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountain sea. but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
This has, at least in his case that he is taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length is a soft transition between city and green zones.
