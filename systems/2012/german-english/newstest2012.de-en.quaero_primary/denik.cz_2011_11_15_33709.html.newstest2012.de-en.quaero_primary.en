The new rules, which could have been to the liberation of the imprisoned Expremierministerin members rejected during the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly negative treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet to be negotiated, in December, the appeal of the convicted in court.
Timoshenko even described the verdict as political revenge by the regime, and also in the West, the process raises the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request, paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Expremierministerin was sentenced to remove from the penal code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
