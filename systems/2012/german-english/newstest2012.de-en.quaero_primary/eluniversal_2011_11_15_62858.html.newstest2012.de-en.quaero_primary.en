The secretary Dionisio Perez Jácome gives details about the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and seven other people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the findings on the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake district of Mora and a further seven people were killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly on the ground, without the pilot could have been able to launch an emergency landing.
At a press conference, said Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transportation, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres contact with trees, while the helicopter lost the hull seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that during the investigations in the area where the plane was decrepit, no helicopter parts were found.
"No aircraft parts were found in other places, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could be several months, perhaps even a year.
For its part, assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (secretariat for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial flown the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the impact was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation.
Visual flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground have had sufficient perspective.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start of flying in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and Mexico state some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds lower area with better view, in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree perhaps it has been a deviation from the flight route before the impact of a loss of control over the plane.
The remains of the plane scattered in a limited area.
Until now, this information suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft residues suggest that the helicopter was aufgeprallt with its intact structure on the ground.
There is no evidence of fire or explosion.
The remnants of the aircraft are at the scene of an accident either on fire or explosion.
The latest findings point to several ground contacts.
During the investigations on the ground, aircraft parts to a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abschüssig and has a Schrägung from seven to thirty degrees.
The photographs show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a painstaking search in an area that went beyond the cordoned off area at the scene of an accident, could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure on the ground.
