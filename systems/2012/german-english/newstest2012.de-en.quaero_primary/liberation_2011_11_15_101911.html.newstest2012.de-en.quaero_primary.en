Europe has invented democracy, we will have to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should remind themselves, who after their invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, the Gulag, but also in Franco's Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some were believed that it will be enough to exercise the right to vote, and direktest possible way for democracy once and for all to win over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
The general election law, the necessary condition of democracy is not a sufficient condition and may well be "repressive instrument ," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, which we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and, above all, politics and democracy crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek casual counterfeiting referendum would have been doubly interesting character in this respect: the need for a powerful return of the policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which, in accordance with the requirements and has been organised in a perverse sequence.
A free ticket for the European dictator or a leap into the void of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen.
No, we want to Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, in fact, no longer where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which is suffering from its impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - it is an Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and every one of its affiliated nations.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, from the markets and to build a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at European level on the condition, which cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to lead to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists fought for a long time, it is now pushing the European economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - that would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In order to create the Republic in France, it took the Republicans to "create."
The revolution of interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to a better economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
