Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health care legislation, as a court accepts case
On the day of the Supreme court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political dividing question whether it is a challenge to the health care legislation will hear from President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner, which was gesponsort by the law firm that represented the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of the health care system, which were adopted last year by Congress, a law that the conservative activists across the United states on the slogan.
The judges agreed with the hearing; in fact, a 5 1/2 - hour basic discussion is expected in March, the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time, the court decision will be in full swing.
The lawyer, who stand trial and will claim that the law is to overturn, Paul Clement will probably be, once attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist society, a group devoted to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the Business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is a huge part in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court had been on the case in a Washington hotel.
Service, among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce critic of the health-care reform
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges attend meetings of the federalist society for years.
And that does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "a judge can participate in benefiz events because local and other organizations, with the judge is not a spokesperson, the guest or a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two of the case related firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this in order to alert Moral-und-Regierungsaktivisten.
"This startling break with morality and contrary to the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with cases pending at the court."
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would issue judicial easily with groups who are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas" wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance in court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias, because they are too much involved in the defence of the law, in order to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
