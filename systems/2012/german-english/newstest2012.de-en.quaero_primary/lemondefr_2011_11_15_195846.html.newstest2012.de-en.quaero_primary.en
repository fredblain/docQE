The CDU proposes that the EU president due to choose general vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, especially for those activists to make the government policy regarding the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine, ten had abstained from the vote.
The several minutes of standing ovation on the basis of which Interventionserlässen at first, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, were not by the three European zugeneigten Finance Minister no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the Antrage - the following slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
It is not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could come through the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone, as it could also be in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general vote "in order to give Europe a face."
But in any case, this is one of the amendment proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU think to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
But the milestone is.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority the proposal of the weighting of each country according to the executive Board rejected the weighting of the individual economies, which is obviously a strong position in Germany.
The calming the climate within their party Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, however, it has not tried to Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulties to win immediately criticize the arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the resolution of the importance of the "Franco-German friendship" a clause, Angela Merkel, France does not call on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago, at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army.
