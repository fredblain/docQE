Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agents at the time, above all, sold only travel in the socialist Eastern bloc countries in the West at that time were chosen.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimea peninsula on the Black Sea), to the Black Sea to Bulgaria and Romania and Hungary to the Balaton.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course, and that is why were severely restricted the trips to Yugoslavia.
It was a great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies offered trips to the West, but had to be huge queues or even in the sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.
So the matter was still a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The czechoslovak currency was not free umtauschbare currency without foreign exchange promise, it would have been impossible to make the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of the world.
An enormous paradox today is no longer conscious at all is the fact that the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
> from the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could have a long time of their trips to the West simply enough, everyone wanted at least a few days there have been.
For example, the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature on foreign travel by Czechs was a with canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the free umtauschbaren Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally free to buy the Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average salaries rose to 1997, which einmündete in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by charter flights, which makes the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which travel more easily.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in the year 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - after Thailand.
Since then, every year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel each year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country brutalized for daring definitely among the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday more than 15 CZK per capita.
