MSS announces a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity in
Social Security Institution, Mexico's leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity among children and young people, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity among children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth," with which the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to take part in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 am tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) began since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the Federal state México) will continue.
If the goal of 500 to 600 individuals is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main urban bezirks) continued and Morelos (in the north of the main urban bezirks).
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill nutritional questionnaires.
They are also questions about their physical activity and their family illness history, risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency, to control.
He also led to the aforementioned Samstags investigative subjects measured (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as the glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with obesity in childhood).
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would take advantage of the health workers concerned about the alarming weight of young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77 percent and the girls with obesity had increased by 47%, while obesity has risen dramatically," said the expert of the IMSS.
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population of the differences in other nations.
He admitted that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, European and 30 to 5 percent of African descent in the genes, which is associated with diabetes and obesity,.
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus of energy (calories) burned, so that this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the research participants would be in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the appearance of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All the information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors say parents all measurements and propose lifestyle changes, which are for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors that are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, the lack of movement on a daily basis, most of the time of the day in front of the television and means of transport to go, rather than short routes.
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high fat and protein, as well as genetics, which is to be analysed in this research project.
