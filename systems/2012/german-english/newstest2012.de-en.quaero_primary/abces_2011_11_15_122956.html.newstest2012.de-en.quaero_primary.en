Athens casts doubt again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums in the peripheral countries and insecurity among disruptive Greece strays in the labyrinth that of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more likely is a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of political forces, slowly by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the agreed at the time of his appointment a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that the new austerity measures and support and in any case, his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February, will be back.
"The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of 26 October," assured Papadimos yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government will reach its peak.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of the disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samaras communication acknowledges the doubts about his position: "We have committed to support the transitional government, but otherwise nothing."
The conservative leader was a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the body of the 8 000 million Athens urgently needed entsperren, and he made it clear that he would not be undertaking on the implementation of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum is still irritated, yesterday reaffirmed its demand was not changed: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" to sign.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, said that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" to return to Athens, in order to discuss with the new government, "for the payment of the sixth section of 8000 million euros" is needed, "although there is still no final date.
The Greek tangle has for a while.
