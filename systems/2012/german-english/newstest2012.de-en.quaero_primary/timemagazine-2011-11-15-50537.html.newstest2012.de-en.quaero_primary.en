Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has been on a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you need only log on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
Were books hiding place of personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the promotional tool of their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific accuracy - as do retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups throughout Europe and visierte them with Adds, but instead with a new band or to connect a new diet product Adds invited users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without that they had to leave their office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a way surprising meanings are "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average three content per day, were books generated "data supernova explosion," a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side of the title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you previously tried to consult the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more problem than students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno suggests that equal students, for example, residential adviser, monitor and help a student if they postet too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-Autor and head of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found in a different way."
Facebook also zapft the data of its own people.
The data team has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used primarily on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have a long time that the side of their large data treasure trove for others available for research purposes.) 
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not. with a friend, thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, the side's own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know something?
While researchers have strictly defined guidelines, such as their offline data collected online, everything is permitted.
"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he looked side of students on Facebook.
"What they are concerned, it was only about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims are true in an user profile and in speeches.
"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tools, anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for it to go into the real world and to speak with real people," he says.
"Social research must take care of the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."
