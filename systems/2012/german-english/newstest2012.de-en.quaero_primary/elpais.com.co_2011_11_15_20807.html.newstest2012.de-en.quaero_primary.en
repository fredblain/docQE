What was missing from the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that played that Melina Ramírez Serna was the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14 title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time had to Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the podium, a silver crown and the band, which they regard as the new Miss Colombia to flaunt.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the Department is already at 14 and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had been kept the crown almost in the hands of the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking is: What was missing?
The result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in any demonstration had shown that they had anything new to be Miss Colombia, but it was not in vain to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie elected by Vogue, titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the panel to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "what book has most influenced and why?" of Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta aria Leamos, was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I think pretty much of the literature, I think it is a kind of civilised way, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for my childhood," the little prince "is a very profound book.
At the moment I read "guilt and atonement." it is a book of universal culture, which we should all read, but I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, which says'passions'.
An answer, which was met with skepticism, firstly because of the term'civilised" and, secondly, because it had not explained how each of the book had affected them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result: "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people: please read a little bit of "The small prince '; it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle is charred.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was the, all Beifälle einheimste and had all prices in the runup to Easter gastronomy competition, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made jealously what the Queen stresste, who could not shine on the stage."
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.
Although it appeared in both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico displayed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" on the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but will not be queen."
In addition, Valle was at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the national beauty contest.
It is a reason that two days before the composition of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who stood up for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they participate in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their Derriere and fibrosis defects found in the stomach area, has said that he had sinned, but this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty" with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there would be better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the back, which for me to be honest, it was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos magazine, the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca the surgery, which she had undergone.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
As a result of this prize, which is the first time will be awarded by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a cruel prediction, which should be true in the night, and it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize was given to them not to come to the enjoyment of the crown.
Regardless of whether it is true or not, the fact that Melina today assumes its domination of the year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to the appointment of the Colombian national beauty contest in one of the international competitions.
It is, However, as one of the queens, despite its overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped, go down in history.
