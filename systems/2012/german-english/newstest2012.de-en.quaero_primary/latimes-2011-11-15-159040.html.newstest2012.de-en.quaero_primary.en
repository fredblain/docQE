Boeing has a record of 18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-track aircraft from the Boeing 777 with an option for 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare news that a company gets about 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company of the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 aircraft, with a record of 18 trillion dollars.
It is also unusual for the charge of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast, which was published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the airline Emirates Dubai.
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to buy 20 more planes, the entire list price to $26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, then ordered, according to Boeing, Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.

"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil producing countries.
Not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, There is a rise in oil prices, which usually is detrimental to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important, because they are less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"You have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Sultanate reinforces Boeing's leading position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus competitor SAS to keep in the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory on the air show comes four months after Airbus has announced that it would postpone the introduction of the biggest A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, after the customers asked for a higher burden and scope.
