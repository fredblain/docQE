The military is growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men for failing to intervene in a rape to be charged before the military court.
If it does not happen, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague, has a 12 s Pack beer.
He asked them whether they should accompany a drink in her room.
"My alarm bells went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin swept aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh, he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind them, put them down and raped her, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, DC, the complaint was initially comprised 17 plaintiffs, but in the next few months rose to 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they are soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or to make a proper justice after the alleged attack.
Burke says it has the top military leadership, because the problem is there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says that she has since February nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.
Their strategy: instead that all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject a complaint.
The files of the court, Newsweek, the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for violations, in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law by the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is not liable for violations that soldiers on active service.
"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiff," the document says.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their fight: three other complaints their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran "Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
The small independent non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder," which received rape victims to dismiss them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws has been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which will provide a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuse.
But most of the abuses are not reported at all, and after the Pentagon's own estimate takes into account the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases per year.
The report, which was published in March, the prosecution rates: 2010, 20% of the cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, she was asked 11 times, the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the attack with her friend.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought that it would be. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came out again, I said to my commander: this was not his procedure, and that was my trial."
Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist, in the end, a diagnostizierte personality disorder and declared them incompetent.
In January 2010, it was sacked dishonourable, so that they have no support.
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other claimants have submitted, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of Law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it has been called into question.
I am a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, which is a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow their path, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens as the first.
