7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5. some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling in the recently discovered jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is how this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer, the zealous Diagrams bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of thought ,"" a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
In 1995, Bob Cringely the TV series "triumph of the specialist idiots" on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than a hour with jobs, in a rare, detailed discussions.
At this stage than 10 years since Jobs have been forced out of Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
Only after jobs death we discovered a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the Mark theatre.
For someone who is known for his extensive interviews, jobs here seems surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds, in which jobs clearly his thoughts and accuracy.
There are also moments in which Jobs" perfect day comes when he seemingly impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst, faster on issues or actions of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the lost interview somehow seems eerily prescient when jobs evaluated what other companies in his opinion is right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing, posthumous awards for career jobs, but jobs are to be seen as the eager dreamers on the leap to the grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should.
Shortly after he had said that everything, he set off and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
As he learned to run a business:
"During the years I always ask:" Why are you doing things? "and the answer you get is," Oh, it is made easy. "
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really carefully about things.
I have noticed that.
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs ," which were estimated at a mere suspicion and then adapted with" deviation "- he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the business costs in minute.
As the Pope was veralbert:
Jobs told of the "Blue Box ," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls in vain.
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a telephone to make a phone call and then from an AT & T network in another, while so many satellites as possible.
"We sent half a dozen times around the globe, and if you grölte into the telephone, there was a minute later in the telephone next door," kichernd told jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.
Jobs have been told from a glorious stroke, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they are in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican, and wanted to talk with the Pope, while they are so good they were Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomat, the two loslachen before the Pope himself came to the telephone.
As he is in the technology (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):
In the age of 12 years ago, when he looked for spare parts to build a radio meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called on him.
Shortly after her 20 minutes telephone call received jobs for the summer a Hewlett-Packard Teilzeitjob.
"This has had a remarkable influence on me. it was the only company that I had seen in the age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated its staff."
Later jobs was one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he was "the first desktop computers ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braun tube and I fell in love with him.
I would like to HP as a teenager climb and hang on to this machine and programmes to write for them.
How innovation improves:
Several times in the interview speaks about how we invent new products.
Early in his career, when he einbaute some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the assembly processes and the extradition of the finished equipment.
Later, when Apple reminds him of the problems in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse, which we are building for $15. it was incredibly credible.
On large companies.
Long before he saw Apple revived, jobs are the ways in which so many industrial giants came with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopying or printer, well?"
They have the monopoly on stock, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, in other words, there are such people, which ultimately lead the companies and the product, in which people are being squeezed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly enjoyed by the people who have no concept about good products versus bad products, eradicated - craft art.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have been able to have the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
On innovation as an art form:
"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... If you develop this great idea, they change and grow."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
We must make votes, certain things that you can do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must note 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together....
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it is to that an attempt is being made, with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to get these things together, which makes it possible.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
