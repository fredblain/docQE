Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book "beauty and horror. A history of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list of players to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: Cut off the side of caution and make it to your readers.
They are the people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and these people as your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments, in which you as Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and are deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book that he was not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, racing reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."
"Beauty and horror" almost war experiences of 20 more or less concealed men and women on both sides of the war of school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some prisoners of war, lose limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives flackert such as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others lapse.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just the devastating war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a very moving book almost from the outset.
The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, which reeks of Kordit.
Imagine that you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"There is a lack of facts," Englund says, "with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other already published material.
Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very vivid in Englunds of the accumulation of small moments losing in.
Many of them act of shortages and Behelfen.
In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."
"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He tells us of the dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett (and most recently was served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato bowls, shoes, which were besohlt with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food substitute foods that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive for ferocity and says about the war: "one feels that this is, after all, what was planned for men rather than to sit on the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and to do so as a front civilisation and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and keeper shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or will be done.
"If the idea to sacrifice themselves, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is so terrible as "a condemned man, who was hanged in secret."
Other observations of the old Europe, which falls apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century ":" the word and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk. "
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also appears behaviour such as Heroismus.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.
"The grotesque expression can be found in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is sleek, but intrusiveness and fits perfectly with its human task.
In dozens of small scenes he starts the way, as the war "in an unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders fighting them.
The best books about the First World War were distorted were distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "nothing new" in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a book.
I admit that there is no longer.
But it is as if he would have with his book this side of the main people in the nose and lit with a match.
