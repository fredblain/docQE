Controversial plan of an oil pipeline will be reviewed after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to in the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and environmentalists, is that the pipeline would provide companies trying to plan the project, so that we can return to normal.
Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of, said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the last week, after which a decision on a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course would be reviewed, the area of sand Hills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large water supply, meide.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered, may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and said his support.
The 1700 mile pipeline, linking Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To this end, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who oppose the plan, weighing up the laws, a departure from the region of sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, to force.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal investigator of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, the by Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser of Hillary Clinton, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company, which has been allocated to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is with Canada.
