Euthanasia and accompanied Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel said that governments, institutions of health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best pain relief funds, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
The Canadian society is living in a state of denial about the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are in fact, with their doctor to talk about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends that the government to amend the criminal law, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent EIU society, the quality of death in 40 countries compared to the world.
Although Canada has placed on the 10th, the study noted that "the medical care in Canada has a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the overwhelming majority of Canadians to die at home, but ultimately die 68.6% of those in hospital.
The whole country, the rate of 86% in a hospital deaths occurred in Quebec.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide, the authors of the report to conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already geäuβert, any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying etem suicide to.
Now, however, there are, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide were legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such a decriminalization Miβbräuche in their application, which is the practice of euthanasia or etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals would entail.
On the contrary, we meet considerably more cases of such violations in the countries where there is no legalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as Jocelyn Downie yesterday, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," said Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that had carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll showed 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, because they are of the opinion that these people would be at the end of her career to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the issue of euthanasia did not lead to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value besäβe.
As for the people who have already assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or suspension of the funds for patients situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
It also in their recommendation list suggests that the criminal law should be indicated that the dumping of funds, for which a legal opposition, not as a criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for professionals in the health care professionals should be trained in the task, a set of the funds at the end of life to be respected, and this without fear criminal prosecution.
The panel said that governments, institutions of hygiene and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to provide the best palliative funding, and this also goes beyond the cases of cancer.
Finally, the body is calling on the Canadian health care institutions far-reaching used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender unorthodox measures, at least to consider, because they just like euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and bezögen on the same procedure.
Other experts reservations
Some experts in the field of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the report put forward by the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts among others described as "extreme ," the practice of euthanasia for patients in the final stage no borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone tired and older than 18 years, another person to ask him to be involved in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who had seen a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in social knitted of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and commitments in a society."
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, also has "a strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report, which they as "per euthanasia manifesto ."
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, the report claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which euthanasia and assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
