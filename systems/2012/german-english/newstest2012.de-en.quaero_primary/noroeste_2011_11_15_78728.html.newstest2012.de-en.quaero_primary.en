The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The switchover from analogue to digital signals in the world in recent years, the most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional claims, which the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were lodged against the presidential decree, and the switch from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes are needed for the legal challenge.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón has not exceeded his powers when he decree-law with the details of the switch to the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision was rejected by the Senate's constitutional dispute, because he did not have the necessary qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court could decide the constitutionality or the constitutionality. So the law remains in force.
In the project for the complaint, which the Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero has been proposed to explain the decree law unconstitutional because, for the radio and television regulations affecting the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale telecommunications Commission in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree-law hierarchical principles and the law would contradict.

The delay in the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the gain of digitisation, which is a decision in the public interest, not just a technical point of view, "because they include economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she said, "the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state had a group of characteristics, which the Constitution in the hands of the central government."
She called that many countries around the world, the digital conversion have already carried out, and the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities.
