Austria
The of a "golden budgetary rule" in the constitution.
The Austrian government in power of the large Socialist / Christian Democratic coalition has decided on Tuesday to include a "golden" fiscal rule into the constitution, in order to reduce public deficits and a possible degradation by credit rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann, personally, this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian state debt 74.6%, far above the set by the Maastricht Treaty criterion of 60%, but well below the debt levels of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"The solvency of Austria not in one fell swoop from AAA to AA +, we would have three billion euros each year to pay interest rates," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice Chancellor and Christian Democrat Auβenminister.
Austria is also a requirement of the Brussels summit of the Member States of the euro zone on 26 October: the heads of state and government would have been at that time, the inclusion of reducing public deficits by the end of the year 2012, as well as a return to the public accounts in the Constitution or by adopting a similar law.
The Maβnahme taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model," because Germany was the first European country that such a "rule" was included in the Constitution.
By the year 2017, the structural budget deficit every year to 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP), from 2017, the structural budget deficit of the federal state should 0,35% of GDP does not exceed, whereas the regional states, as well as the communities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is on the horizon of 2020/21 to eradicate the budget deficit below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht treaty.
