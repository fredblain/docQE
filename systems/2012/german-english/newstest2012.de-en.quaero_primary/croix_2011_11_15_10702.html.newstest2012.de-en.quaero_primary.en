Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which is at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe unites directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany under the sea links directly with each other.
The German Chancellor, Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolic joint turned the steering wheel of the channel, which the Russian gas transported into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which the region of st. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which has a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline of themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this vast edifice as a victory.
The project was in Poland and the Baltic states strongly disputed.
The Nord Stream pipeline will provide a direct gas supply to Germany, avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little of its power: it is now more difficult For them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate, has not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project an even greater security of supply.
This, however, at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project has a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed in barely five years ago, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, which have strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are becoming exhausted.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," said François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the gas pipeline by pointing out to what extent the groβen contracts from political and economic side are important.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete casing, which is intended to protect them from ships berth.
It rests on the seabed around 200 metres deep.
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"Some hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
We also had to be taken more measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, or maintenance stations.
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from it, as the Swedes were little eager to a Russian state company in a permanent way to their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we are Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
In the case of a leak gas in the gas pipeline escapes, into the air.
This case comes from the designers, however, as the approaches to the consistency of a leak was estimated per 100,000 years.
The state surveillance of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot, controlled by an of from external virtue purposes, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without even the slightest repair.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This is 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.
Five companies have combined their efforts to achieve this project.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is charged with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in train in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then this society has rented the entire capacity of its Gastransportes and renewable 20 year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real from transporting volume," added Mr Müller.
The financing of the baus gas pipeline to 30% of shareholders, as well as 70% backed by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the total investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are, however, gewiβ to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metres high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of the arriving gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with one million cubic metres of Russian gas supplies per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour, as well as 6 million in 2012.
