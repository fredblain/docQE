Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy, this policy, this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students was marked by the authorities" side, the weekly schaus, the Interior Minister had in passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France "no talent, masons or waiters from abroad."
But this policy was only rarely from the economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a broad consensus between right and left.
> from the right side, the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900 people, including more than 2 million immigrierte workers, will pose no problem for a country," from left side by Michel Rocard, who had set out in 1990, France "could not take the whole poverty in the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005, both from the right and the left.
Both camps, the immigrants were seen as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity towards the immigrants who are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to which it to, partnership development, to solve our problems of migration ."
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Mr Cameron in a recent work, which the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
The immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening the indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace by exerted pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact essential complementary than the local wage workers, because they focus on the jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet the job.
The low skilled immigrants work in sectors, local wage workers poking little talented among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants immigration on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants is a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0,9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants, as well as the economic growth is conducive to (high proportion of immigrants naturalized immigrants under American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to the social systems in European countries, on average, for example, in an amount of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of intersection "with the teeth."
These teeth, which should deter immigrants, but achieved exactly the opposite effect.
