Mission ended, Congress prepared to Libya
Ultimately, it is as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington would have to agree on the riots in Libya.
All that was needed to was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee on International Relations of the Senate resolution, which the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), with Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage. ."
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the U.S. military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain a resolution of the United States, which limited use of military force in Libya.
The law has been in the Senate by a broad fringe of both parties, and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this bill in the Senate. The chamber also overruling a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress, which was enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulated the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners, who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."
The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as it did the law in June?
The latest version of the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the spitzen republikaner of the committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he had not seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it is up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional term, Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of the Republican Bob Good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or any other area at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they tried often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes, which were presented to the Congress and include a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate - others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of balancing the budget in the Senate and another dozen "federal spending control ."
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure "written."
The Budgetary Control Act, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
In addition to the budget, some members want the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans Jos√© E. Serrano (New York), the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments, which, among other things, the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment, which prohibits a marriage under Gleichgeschlechtlichen, as well as an amendment, which prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring presentation.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states they reject.
For example, how to move the changes so much faster than in the past few years.
In the 111th Congress legislators 77 such changes, presented in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which members regularly more than 150 amendments proposed every two years, according to the figures, which the Senate library is available.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment added - 27 - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to the Congress in 1789.
