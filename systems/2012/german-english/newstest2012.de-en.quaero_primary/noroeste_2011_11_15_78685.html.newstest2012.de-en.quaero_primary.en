Debt for construction work
In the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 Sozialbaus for migrants who are at risk because of a lack of resources not to be completed, or only with great delay, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The head of the municipal authority for social development, said that, although the building are already at an advanced stage, they are now in danger, because the government allotted funds for the three programmes 11 million peso has not paid.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes almost 50 million peso, which fell 25 percent of the state, but until now, only the Federación and community funds contributed to the work, which is why a delay in the Baubeendigung was to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year end, they have given us a penny, even though they are already in July would have to pay a part of," he said. "in order not to be too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state has not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the community at the beginning of the government a loan of 7 million needed to borrow would be equivalent to the amount that the central government would have to pay.
"That was already in the last parliamentary term, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programmes went further and this year we have had to raise the funds, which had not raised by the state to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the state authorities are obliged to the disbursement of these funds, he commented that the minister for administration and finance, has been asked to speed up the administrative work and pay the outstanding amount as quickly as possible.
"They must contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year comes to an end, they have given us a penny."
