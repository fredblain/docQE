Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of organised crime during the entire electoral processes and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... You have polling booths, road blockades built... And people are to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico, until they lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are looking for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo as victors.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD, which is still acting governor, came to three, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specializes in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has Michoacan chosen in December 2006 to launch a military offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election, during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
For the PRI a victory party, no matter how repugnant the elections appear in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI in the presidential race is likely to be represented, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory gives us look into the next year."
