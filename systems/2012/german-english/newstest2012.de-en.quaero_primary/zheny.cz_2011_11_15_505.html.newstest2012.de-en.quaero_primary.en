The worst female vices: what is it with you?
If the men to give some typical female vices, they invariably shake some promptly from the sleeves.
The women, you see in the following lines, in which a few Unsitten review, the men's blood in the cold?
Shopping addiction
If her husband to be shopping addicts?
Do you have to buy at least a weekly?
Do you like to shop and to be a little more?
It is in your case a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping to or less under control.
But hand on heart, what is already in the search for a good clothes from a clothes shop on bummeln, and not all (in every possible colour combinations) in the booth?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They have, but how often she said her husband - you really be outside...
Constant discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have to buy at least five kilos - I should start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
If they sounds familiar?
Yes?
Then you belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look.
This is not a long time ago that you should go, but many men have an allergic reaction, if their wife whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints are women always unvertr√§glicher.
Order and cleanliness in first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, tiles and dust, the bath scheuern - and this at least twice a week.
Schimpfen you with their partner, because he once again with dirty shoes trample on clean tiles, you chastise the children, because it gescheuerte washing basin is already an and because the glass door in the living room cabinet has been fingerprints that extrapolate so much trouble?
If you are under this kind of "Devianz," then you should know that we should not exaggerate and order and cleanliness in family life does not in the first place.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can harm the mutual relations and, above all, the rest in the family.
Sticheln
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"Do you want to attract the old socks really attract tomorrow?"
"A watery towel is not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that he brings to the Palme.
It is not a bad thing, but they want all his order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not be so much to grumble.
Gossip and novelty
Some women clap and tratschen, behind the backs getuschelt or even slandered or forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they like to make such issues, such as, for example, - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think each of us has a little harmless gossip and novelty at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre, whom nobody and nothing is sacred, I think everyone in their environment, and particularly for women pose a significant risk.
