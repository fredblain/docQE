Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
If you are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, we know it as a modern company, even though a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for this longevity has been its first chief - the visionary Thomas J. Watson,.
He was the slogan, countless global problems could easily solved if people would be willing to think a little bit.
His slogan "Think!" has become the hallmark, which should take the life of the future giant (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, IBM in the year 1935 began).
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us from IBM means that long-term thinking is a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century successful because it has remained true to its principles and not shied away changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technology to transform the business and society.
We hope that we will create even more in the next hundred years, "said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thought-out system
Watson was already in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the entrepreneurs, plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
Equally sophisticated IBM long-term relationships with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM any discrimination - and could pick and choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped seniority by a woman, Virginia Rometty.
It is already 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the Vetriebs, marketing and strategy manager.
IBM makes so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas, it is enough, the company is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their steadfast position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and domestic and foreign.
"From the outset, IBM is the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business problems with the help of technology helps resolve," said George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
The company pointed out, there is a difference, only to be present on the market or directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos because of the family "Big Blue ," has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the militaries technology companies - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the diskette.
With approximately 220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) this year, IBM was the second major technology company (after Apple), but it was the first time since 1996, Microsoft took over.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, OS / 2, the online service, for example, or even the IBM PC computers jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we should not be emotional attachment to the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and if they do not work, they also leave again.
In contrast to the rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
The profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth.
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000 veräußerte IBM little profit abwerfend assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, 58 billion dollars in the future technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first boss Thomas J. Watson, in the middle of the global economic crisis increased its investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis.
The value of the IBM shares increased since 2008 rocket by 120 percent and the profit of the company kontinuell grows.
The company slogan of IBM: everything can change - not only the values.
For that reason, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls off the next crisis.
IBM history: from cheese Schneider to space flights
A hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
According to the name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
According to the foundation for the subsequent society IBM, the merger of four companies, whose history dates back in the 1980s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration work begins and endes.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board of directors.
And it was Flint, the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him with the management of the company.
This Leader, then even the founder of IBM in the shadow - Watson's ideas based on the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name tells us, in the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - -und sausage schneidern cheese to go.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he has doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company expanded gradually on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under his stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped technicians and computers from IBM to launch flights into space - the Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM in 1964, the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the series IBM System / 360.
A classic PC, the computer standard of that time came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM veräußerte computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the mom-and-pop part of the company, PricewaterhouseCoopers and jumped wholeheartedly into the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value.
The strategy, IBM is paying off in the last three years, is the concept of "smart planet."
It is the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently setup the platform "Smarter Commerce ," which is intended to help the dealers to take the whole trade cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Back in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR is, among other things, a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe moved in Prague and is also a top world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification.
