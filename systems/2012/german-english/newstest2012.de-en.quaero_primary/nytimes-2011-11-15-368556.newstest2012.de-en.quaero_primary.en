The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs
The union, the hundreds of school mentors who have lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance, the union, District council 37, in their efforts to make the redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff, among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on October 7 in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the last year, the city access to a health fund, the working groups, had with which the budgetary gap should be closed.
This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools in the last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the council shot back and told him that spezifiziere nothing in the budget that the school aid workers would be laid off.
Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint, and there will be a press conference on the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will formally announced on Wednesday.
The complaint is Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has been on the number of redundancies at the schools in poor neighborhoods of the city, in order to support a complaint for discrimination; they claim that poor schools have lost more workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there are no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school workers in District 23 in Ville, Brooklyn, have lost and 46 workers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South Bronx were.
With the loss of five of eight school who, in the 36 public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents can organise the donations to offset budget cuts."
P. S.: the budget of the 36th Distrikts this year has been cut by 3,26 percent, but it also lost money when the city of its calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.
The union also complained that the head of the high schools by the language in a memo, which approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German) in the United States usually the change of a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators have been laid off," says the draft.
