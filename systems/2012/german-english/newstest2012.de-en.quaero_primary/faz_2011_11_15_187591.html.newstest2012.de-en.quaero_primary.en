The Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since stumbled from one crisis to the next.
Now it is to be a German.
It was not thought Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was reported in July that he 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: President of the Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was celebrating publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kind remarks about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland praised bankers had to go.
President of the board of UBS, since also - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber?
It became known that Weber, the bank of February 2012.
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber will be hard.
He is not a banker, economics professor and central banker, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again that they have long been the title "the greatest scandal bank of Europe ."
On the one hand, the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters she had combined with ambitious goals: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.
This made sense.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: "I have the UBS was regarded as a model of a good bank."
"From today's perspective, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it was the first time that something went wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli, which was, as highly intellectual and equally brilliant bankers.
A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase of as much as 13 billion francs.
But was actually investors, however, some of which until shortly before the nose would have been gerümpft: an obscure Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there have been worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National bank of UBS bought problematic securities for tens of billions, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible loan, on which it could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she saw how dramatic it is for a small country, if it is so big banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," banking researcher says.
The first disaster was the second.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business, including criminal premium.
In doing so, the UBS known more or less open to have helped in terms of tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in the competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board President.
And the exodus of customers" money.
For example, the bank within a few months their credibility lost in two key portfolios: investment banking through speculation and asset management with the help of tax evasion.
And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will now have to get it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.
And it is obvious that the risk management in the investment banking, it is still not clear.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial chief of a large German bank is safe: "the problem of UBS is that it does not have the risk control under control."
It was is the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers were lined up for a long time, the guardian of the great wealth of the world: no great risks for safety for money - may want to collapse the world on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road, which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee, flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere like Tiffany is taking place here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks: the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are Drinnen marble, thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe ."
The UBS knows what the customer wants: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point - or betrayed, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name, he would not like to read in the newspaper, finally, does he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS had become far too big, he is taking place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have long been adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its first high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost in the jungle lost so much money as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "the UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly EUR 45 billion devoted to the politicians, in order to save the big bank facing bankruptcy.
How did it happen?
When you talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks, with a huge corporation.
It was a bank in the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew more and more.
It helped that the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money with which they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man of the bank and has worked at the top."
But in the end Ospel relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models are the reality," He says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: frolic came before the case.
UBS staff clearly remember the meetings at which CEO's Wuffli the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the League Tables, "rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.
In the meantime, the UBS, according to the top.
Some steps have already been achieved it.
In the foreign exchange business and equity trading, she played at the top.
Business advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international business interest in the bank "Fixed Income," there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that they almost claimed the existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself, as well as a confirmation of hedge funds in the U.S. sub-prime assets.
It became a huge machine, the securities on American mortgage loans packaged and did so at - but also risks.
Also, as other banks have long sought.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market was going up in flames, UBS has bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
The euphoria, so deep.
A manager after the other had to go to clean up the trials more difficult than expected.
UBS has become the weapon and are still shaky.
Anyone who now leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank, which are all obvious business models.
Banking researcher has an idea: stop the investment banking, concentrating on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank does not want to (yet).
But the investment banking is expected to shrink, so much is already clear.
On Thursday to present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti of the world its future strategy.
The 51 years old schweizer Italo was only intended as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has asserted that he is to lead the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank in the back in the 1990s.
It is 3500 jobs.
But this will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What they want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
Publicly he says only that he will with his wife once an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
