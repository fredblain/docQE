Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism about the return match against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The Hinspiel had both teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will have a happy team and, above all, be a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his Nationalelf, for which he is responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, only 90 minutes sanctuary.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken.
Portugal dominated for more than a hour of the game, but the team was not able to cause the important mark, which would have taken the pressure off her.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlend Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced, before an audience, which is to be hot in the game, even if the game, of course, was announced as a "very tight," said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but they are completely convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42 - year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of the Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to achieve a goal and win.
A draw is also a gateway to the Bosnians, who have already been.
"This is a good result, but there is a certain amount of risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor," Bento regrets.
"We will be able to compete against a team, the high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they have no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that it will be implemented this time.
