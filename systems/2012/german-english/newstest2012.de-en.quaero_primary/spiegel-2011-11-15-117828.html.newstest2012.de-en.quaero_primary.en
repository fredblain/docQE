Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken Ufo-Optik, future pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be seen blue miracle - and after a city tour or a wandering Sprudelbädern hide behind the tired legs.
A book shows, where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder in the past one and a half years on research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.
Rücklings on the water, they looked in elaborate domes, they swam Putten marble, they waited in the basin, and was meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Gefiel her a bath, she took in her notiz book - all the knowledge worth details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools answer architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her book "bathing pleasures:" People's swimming halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
By 13 countries, their "journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe ": in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46 - year-old German is a true Badekultur-Enthusiastin.
In sport, it does not have much in the, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful baths."
Water doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bathrooms geplätscher in the basin and ethereal sauna oils - is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "Instead of a floor in dipping water surface."
"It is transparent, on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All doubled blend: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, bretter.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing pleasures" gives 190 pages of knowledge about the architecture and cultural history of historical wellness oases - but above all, for a leap into the blue.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
In addition, sumptuous Heilbads such as the 100 years old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in an urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a flaschenförmigen building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, while the Zurich Dachbad the whole city, it is an external pool Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and, in the, there is a window from which you can monitor the activities of the Ski-Piste.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like an Ufo landed in the Alps.
> From three upwards open Schales dampft in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
It is not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so much for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, which is almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin, once you slip into the pool - a wellness experience.
In one place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites, however, also disappointed: When they free and sun in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz wanted to visit, they found a cordoned off area.
The 1902 by the architect Duan Jurkovic bath has now been closed.
When Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-Weis-yellow art nouveau building, she saw how weeds between the tiles grown.
It the decline has countered, however, in a beautiful swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais hot springs at Bad Wildbad.
Three construction has this bad already behind; it can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra style, which was added in 1900.
Since the 1995 thorough modernization is the Palais hot springs pool kennerin Lieblingsbad iris Meder - and not just because they originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, so different Baustile at such a great unity," says Meder.
With such a palace is the Tauchgang in thermal pool only incidental.
