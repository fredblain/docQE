The main assembly is to find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek will be at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.
To date, there is still no agreement on how the electoral law is to be elected.
And without, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek resigned from his post, and his colleagues in the departure had to reach an agreement and to find a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.
However, in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers were once again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, when the new chairman should be chosen.
The delegates of the main assembly were in vain in the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial produced no result, and it was not just about the election itself.
You could not agree on who is entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for state and law, whose opinion a representation at full power base was not admissible.
The disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to persist.
The executive committee did not bring more clarity on the issue in meetings - no matter whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election of a few times - the worst point remained the same.
The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is the question of whether we should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, which in the management of the professional football.
According to registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the victor in this percentage vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"The two Vorrunden make no sense, this modus operandi would, the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best not to bend the electoral law, but to choose under current statutes.
Surprisingly, this is also true Tomáš Paclík, even if it seems that the statutory order of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
"My wish is that as much as possible will be in accordance with the statute."
"This is no nonsensical ersatz variants to be invented, as in the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football clubs) Victoria Plze, who is standing for the first time, above all in its opinions from to Pelta.
Pelta, however, remains optimistic.
In his opinion, will be known in Nymburk the new chairman, and he believes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football on the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten has the most experience on both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, ambivalent."
"It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
"That is why it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time for the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football generals until the qualification will be at all.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl should fly Podgorice, could not start in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all and so feverish for an alternative option as a part of the executive committee to get to the site of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
Ultimately, it is surely the meeting at ministerial level crucial to which it is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education would have liked to have, the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming general assembly of the ČSTV, the Czech sport in the financial problems of Sazka's new direction.
Paclík goes in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would be able to make a strong candidate all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have nothing to do with the battle for the top position.
"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find an Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the match with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the supposed favorites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he if he wins the role of chairman, only one year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to see an experienced "not too much involved in the football.
"With some of the people I have spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that some people said that they do not want to identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
The most of all Paclík alleged Pelta links with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman.
"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem Businessman, would be doubly bad football," said Paclík.
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of Pelta (tsch) should play football."
"And how we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club, if Pelta chairman will be," but it looks a little more calmly.
If Paclík in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I am not my nose in matters, which I understand," said Paclík, who was in September for attention that he was behind the recall of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment, and to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which descends into horrific situations ," which makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta leader Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, in which he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."
"When it comes to the taxation of happiness, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money is going," he said.
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he pointed out, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."
Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"It is not ideal."
"It is not my opinion but much sense to transfer my shares in Pilsner club hypocritical to a third person to return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAR ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the case of his election, that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had not realized election in September, he wants to focus in the case of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.
He decided at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting, and it might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man who is associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that the current problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as complete as it had adopted.
If they do not allowed to different interpretations, we would have had a chairman, "said Pelta.
It is the revision of the most important document of the citizens" association he used as bait for the delegates.
"I should be president, then I take it personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work."
"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
It also Tomáš Paclík attack, for a long time, which has no dry thread Pelta.
In football, he has more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"His attacks were herabsetzend, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is also why many doubt its true nature," adressierte Pelta his opponent, who will remain faithful to its proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to try to put an end to all Affairen - from the fog Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would like to negotiations with the private and public sector, in order to ensure sufficient funds for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football will mean no human cleansing.
"I would have been familiar with the content of all employees," he said in Strahov direction, where there is understandably nervous because of the long anarchy.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the forthcoming general assembly, he believes that the delegates are not in vain on Thursday to go to Nymburk.
"If you really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."
"Football needs credibility and he is the only if he finally has a new leader," remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him to work hard begins
If the current deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General meeting on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, would this supposed vermiesen many people in the mood.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his election will begin to work hard.
He wants to introduce systemic changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and otherwise to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to focus on the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football for the young people. "
"I do not want to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the executive committee that each member pays a certain area."
And I will be distributing tough tasks, so that the football in every segment is moving forward. "
Moreover, many not just delighted, because they, rather than to criticize the work of others, should begin to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have not to stand at all.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, I do not use a stick between the legs and every step that I am put into question," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do it."
"This is confidence that we must not squander," he said.
It is allegedly motivated him, should be able to continue the work he has begun under Hašek.
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I will not just throw away."
"There have been trials started only in a few years to play, and I would like to see someone cut off," he said, and expresses its concern at the fact that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something that does not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.
It also contradicts the assertion that he was only a leader of the Czech Republic.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I have to do what is best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian part, whose winners in each of the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the post of chairman, Rajchl does not have the courage to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations with the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association was not in a single direction.
While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question that he Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has begun, and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not want to altered just on his favour, "Rajchl ruling on his rivals.
