In the past week has been mitangehört on an open microphone, as the French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.

Stories about Schummeln at school and college tests are widespread.
There have been incidents in which teachers their students test answers, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lies and Schummeln.
How much deception we see?
As studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as Notlügen.
Another study shows that strangers to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lies, or "lies" is one that is important for every human being, and that both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as, for example, in which it is the goal, "you!" is the Enttarnen of a deception, a serious knowledge based on scientific data over the past six decades have been collected at prestigious universities, which had carried out extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
As a result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies were revealed.
Look lies in the eye.
They stammeln falters, blush and zappeln not always.
As a result, we can not conclude that these liars difficult to identify and treat.
An experienced Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the opinion that the subtle facial expressions, and timing.
I have spent several years, the scientific findings of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the in exposing, and it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern ability, which is easy to learn and help us find in our complex world, especially if the closing or the questioning of people or negotiations or administration belong to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to other people to raise their interest and to control their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extrovertierte people are more often than introvertierte people that men are more than women, "lies" selbstorientierte whose lies more "other" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people anlügen their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies ").
We also know that if a person has been exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty, this person to have lied.
As you can tell whether someone is lying?
First, by watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining," the starting position.
It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes.
A the attitude, the laughter, the quality of their participants.
They should know better, when someone is normally standing trippelt with the foot, so that they do not unfairly when he trippelt during a meeting with the foot.
Then you look at accumulations more startling verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells ring, not as proof of an exposing.
People who are, perhaps, if they try to remember their history, and perhaps their feet in the door or they are in the outcome, change their position on significant way or show a "relaxation after the recruitment interview," this deep, entspannende Ausatmen and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Interrogator often mistakenly signal that a recruitment conversation is over, only after this detente after the recruitment interview.
You also pay attention to the language of your participants.
The slip-up by Scott Peterson is famous, when he used the past tense, when he claimed that his wife was still on life and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distance language: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you have a tricky question repeated in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when it is a vexed question: ..." in order to tell you the truth... As far as I know... In good faith. "
This is the answer wahrnehmend rather than factual, which often the alarm bells.
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen of lies, but they can learn skills, thanks to an exposing is possible.
Thanks to these skills can be the victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
