Energy policy:
Facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, so it is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity in direct impact on the purchasing power, as well as the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable to take an election for a reason, on this issue and think about the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should have their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, is not a huge proportion of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, we must reduce the scarcity of fossil resources to continue to produce steady electricity without the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget, in order to fight against climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
That is why blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision on the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source in Switzerland, which is just to build nuclear power plants in the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination.
For its part, the United States have decided after Fukushima, their park another unit, the plant shut down after the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island in operation.
Even if the renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes as a model, but contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be an increase in the price of electricity prices, by the increased use of Importgas increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in carbon dioxide emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The of these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is an European leader in wind energy, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternating with wind energy; so there are its CO2 Ausstösse, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours in contrast to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy a key element of competitiveness, as well as a measure of stability in the industry on national soil, the French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion.
Polls showed that a price that the vast majority of French people, and neither is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export nature it brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs.
If France decision to get out of nuclear power, it would be a large part of these SMEs fall victim, and the annual eur 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electricians would be an EPR designed to operate at 60 years if the decline of its producers is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that just a little bit like a devil, a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
The company Areva, low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants such as, for example, is carrying out the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams, who have made a name to their professionalism, are the security obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single, and Three Mile Island, under normal operating conditions; it was without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl was the drama of reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima seem to forget that some of the accident of two natural disasters on an unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn its lessons from this accident, as well as after the two previous had done.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power stations, the EPR is a draft of its resilience in the face of such phenomena possible.
Because it is considered among the electrical engineers as desirable to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein to the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber, as well as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
