The threat is real
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" Turkish media cast doubt on the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which is now auflebe again.
The murders of eight Turkish and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news will be in Turkey and in the Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.
For many German türken returns with a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with extreme right-wing background against Turks.
The fact that in Germany, there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network reveals, however, reveals proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.
"The bloody ideology?" the headline on the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper Haber Turk. "
The newspaper Sabah, however, stressed that one of the perpetrators has been a V-Mann of the constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
Besonnen responded to the Turkish community Germany: remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the Turkish anwerbe agreement.
The was orchestrated in cheery colours - as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the umpteenth" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X," which cites the background of the series of murders.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" it is not to be linked.
"It starts to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people have been murdered, the taxes paid and with their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done.
It will be extremely critical in Germany's Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their later investigative success.
Why the German authorities would not have much more to look in extreme right-wing circles for suspects, the authors were surprised.
Some shows, at least rhetorically committed to drastic measures: "will continue to be done carelessly, the migrants do nothing other than the defense and the armed forces."
"This will probably be the best protection."
"The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What does it mean if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, the attacks we sense on the Turkish side.
The mistakes of the past are not repeated
In the Turkish press was particularly at the time, above all, the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, however, represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges, the local Turks.
So, as berechne the value of a human being, according to the size of its tax revenues.
The current reporting of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the rule of law.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words.
