Climatic adversity blocking the economy
In the first year in which Mario Lopez took part in the government, unemployment rose in Sinaloa and the black economy, while the foreign investment and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, the in economic history Sinaloas remembered, and it is the first year in which Mario López Valdez, who described himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes on the economic growth, the government is, however, as a result of the climatic adversity can be growth, but on the contrary, deteriorated the most important economic indicators.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses of millions of dollars in agriculture, but also the growth of the state economy close borders and caused in the first quarter of a general decline in economic activity by 3.6% this is mainly on the historic dismantling of agricultural development at 31.16 percent, allowing other sectors of the economy.

Mexican Council for sustainable agricultural development) report on the impact of the frost, there were 582 000 hectares of arable land damaged, of which 78.03 percent and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially destroyed, all of the vegetables, maize and chickpeas.

Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in the year to several factors: the economist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the School of Economic and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), commented on the policy of public institutions indirectly declare growing unemployment.
"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with the loss of liquidity in the market as a result of the cuts by the legislation, which was adopted to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who accumulate stashed dollars, it is not easy for them to work, to invest or otherwise use anything," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the increase in unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people in the country to look for work abroad, especially in the United States, has fallen. This is due to the entry of problems and, on the other hand, on the one hand, because it is difficult to find work, and these people remain here and looking for work, unemployment rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, if one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes, according to INEGI 60.38 percent of the country's employees, who work without paying into the coffers of the social security system.
With regard to unemployment and undeclared low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (governmental authority for work and Social welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa until September 5352 pesos; that is very much less than the national average, which stands at 7375 pesos.

The Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (governmental authority for economic development), for its part, recorded a total investment of EUR 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, the company mainly comes from the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic crisis, the provincial government in July at the National Congress, a loan of 3000000000 pesos, the reactivation of the economy in infrastructure projects should be invested in the 18 communities. The National Congress approved an amount of EUR 200,600,000 pesos, but until November no positive effects of the debt on some of the economic sectors in the country.
Reactions
For the representatives of the people, the first year of government, Mario López Valdés government incompetence.
Miguel Loredo López, chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (state chamber of manufacturing in Mexico), argued that in 2011 no efforts to harmonize the views of different sectors, including the federal government, have been made.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa was really very poor in this year, and it needs to be worked hard to regain lost ground in this year and 2012 we must exert twice. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already government teams have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year, the country's economic development and growth slowed.
"The economic flow is the result of a number of events, including the Frosts. One of the most important impact is a slowing economy, which is not enough to an economic dynamism, which generate a reasonable flow of processes, products and services. That is why we will finish the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefine
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Mexico) employers" association in Sinaloa said the state should be more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have seen that work has been done, and we believe that it is necessary for a long-term programme to redefine the economic appeal and to develop the country, because it is important that all the material and human resources to activate Sinaloas," he said.
There is much to be done
The chairman of Coparmex stressed how important it is to develop a vision of the future, which draws the efforts of the government in a better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas, but the economic development has come forward, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He stressed that the current government is making progress in the government.
"There are areas in which we can say that the government has acted more fully. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is a lot of work lies ahead of it," he said.
