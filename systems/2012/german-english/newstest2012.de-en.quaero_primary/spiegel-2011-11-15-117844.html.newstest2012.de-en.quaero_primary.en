The Deutsche Bank business with agricultural commodities?
According to online information, Josef Ackermann has appointed a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the CEO's wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg.
The matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans for the German citizens find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of respondents want the Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions out of this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest people in the world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, betting on the global commodity markets prices soar - and the banks are partly to blame for the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Commodity bets were originally intended for traders hedge against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the U.S. competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business is worth it "the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an International working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.
By the end of the year is expected to be completed, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the head of the bank wants to tell us what consequences.
In the end, could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann fusses over his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, however, his criticism of the financial industry: "the betting on rising prices of food particularly dramatic shows how reckless banks today, the common good."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, especially in the duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must remove all assets from its portfolio, where money will be used for betting on food prices," said Bode.
"No matter whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the German Bank."
The insight of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, it is clear, however, that the CEO's just a few months before his departure from office would like to make a perfect picture.
On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned will not change in the supervisory board.
In a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could improve his image.
And it needs for possible losses to be little fun - after all, his successor would have to do so.
Every second would cancel commodity crops
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users took part in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday, Bode published the poll, for which the institute Forsa on 7 and 8 November has interviewed 1001 people.
Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities, where bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal conclusions when they learn that their bank is involved in such transactions: Every second, according to the survey would terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation.
43% would advise friends of such a bank, 49 percent said they consider to terminate their accounts and to switch to another institution.
