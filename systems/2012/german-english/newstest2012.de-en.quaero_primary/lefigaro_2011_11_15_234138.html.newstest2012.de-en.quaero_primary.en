The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry competing in simplification and ignorance about China, Iraq, as well as the provision of aid to Israel.
Can a krisengeschwächtes America a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate, the voters could almost get that impression.
Over the past few days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and their supporters in their thundering declarations and statements on foreign policy, traditional Republican priorities, said repeatedly.
On China, Iran and Israel aid - often based in any way - slogans.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" at the top of the course Mitt Romney threatened to cite the Chinese before the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia strongly prefer not to blame.
Stupid, if this is to imply the introduction of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama, and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, almost about his schmeichelnden behavior strangled.
He had a firm, but constructive talks with Beijing (also the current position Obama's).
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he has stagnated in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halting the nuclear programme.
"If I am elected, I commands Iran," he was on hearing.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
In addition, Israel has increased military aid promised and Obama accused his partners on commitments to be.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, zweithöchst platzierter candidate, for its part, has a shameful acts of ignorance.
Recently, he called on the Chinese military threat against, because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to be the fact that China is already been in place since 1964 in possession of military nuclear weapons.
The Texas governor Rick Perry supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, for its part, is to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The Obama 2009 prohibits the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also of Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann advocates.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan had also simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine had to pay, which was the subject anti-terrorist.
They are right to insist on the failure of his naive Zwiegespräches with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which he is also the reputation of the weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so straightforward.
The population estimates the positive assessment of the national security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq asserted against military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised more by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt, in order to give its leadership position.
