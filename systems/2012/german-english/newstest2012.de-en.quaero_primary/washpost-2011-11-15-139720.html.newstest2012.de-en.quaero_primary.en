Troops feel more sympathy than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, the millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballade about helplessness, frustration and loss.
In a word collected themselves hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, which, among other things, by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen has been observed, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure the organizers have good intentions.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if their people in uniform suffering.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way of support, to put ourselves in the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, who do not want ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They also have recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last few years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result there are discussions about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from battles with the marines, warned Colonel ex-army Mark Cancian that people outside the military world their service could be seen from two different perspectives.
Some would view them with a sense of awe, as they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and a senior government posts in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer erfragten subtle, whether he was the same after his return from the struggle to cope with the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you are talking about your service, you must keep the negative impressions about it," Cancian said his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in part in the lack of interest in the war.
Services on the battlefield of a country that has little experience with the military and little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, rarely singled out as praise.
"We as a nation, not military heroism, as it was in the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely due to the suffering of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost them, or for the severity of their injuries.
