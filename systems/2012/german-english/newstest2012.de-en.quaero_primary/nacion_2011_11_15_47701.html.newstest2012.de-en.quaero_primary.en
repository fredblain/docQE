"To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true."
In an exclusive interview with Viva says the Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is prepared for the next Sunday in the national stadium to give one of their best concerts.
More than 20 years they have been expected, but the band assured that it is a dream come true, if they play in Costa Rica.
The the Bassist and Mitgründer group, Jeff Ament, the Viva last week by Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20 years of existence, and on Sunday, 20, they make their only freeze in Central America.
On this day, they come from 7.30 pm in the national stadium, along with the band the X from Los Angeles and Las robe rtas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript to be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans realised a dream when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time that we in South and Central America, and until now, it has been great.
I am only on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country, that we will stay a few days ago.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this, because the fans of the band are completely; you can see the days before the concert closest possible.
What does it to your enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years on our side.
We have spent nearly 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and we are very sorry to have waited so long to have taken so long, until we came here.
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a few giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we are prepared for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did your Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend are, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.
With a view of the travel giant shows with many songs.
What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played, we have no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and our fans a good and varied repertoire.
It is never repeated your repertoire.
Why?
I think that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so that the decision, which we will play against each other, is not easy.
If we have two or three songs, which we have no longer have played into the repertoire, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us, because they are the reasons why we have taken this Song's. They might otherwise be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates its twenty years of history.
If you look back, it is hard to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented to play once in a great rock band, and more than 20 years, and it looks like a dream.
We continue on this blessing, and it is great to be able to make music together.
We love, and we are thrilled to bring music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What does it mean for you, actively participated in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large bands.
We are good with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and very unusual, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time, come from the same city.
We are proud and honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound garden on their tour. We are pleased to be friendly with them all and honoured to be part of this past Seattle Sound.
It is also very unusual for a band like yours so long ago, together with the same musicians.
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago, and that It is a lot more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to be alive and we also care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. It could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
As long as we keep in mind that people have come because of the music reminds you that you have the music and what they created, must be careful not to be a famous rock star, and that has never interested.
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we have very good songs, and at the beginning, it was great.
We were three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos by various groups and the band did best, and that is why we are curious to see what robe rtas live can offer live. This is exciting.
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you play live?
This is an issue for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he thinks.
Who you got to be affected as Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the bassists, which I could talk about.
As Pearl jazz Jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards, nirvana and all the others that were at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I believe there are a few tunes created on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or just Breathe, which are classified as very dark Song's, even though they also have something positive.
Both, I had the tears when I heard how Ed played, and it is very dark Song's.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if a family member or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.
But I am also of the opinion that we have to be a happy man and can still make dark music.
