Meanwhile, another part of the movement of the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where it came to nine arrests.

Bray said that the response of the "Empörten" on the evacuation of their tent camp, which directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered to court, where judge Lucy Billings issued an injunction banning the forced evacuation of the place and the demonstrators to the tents.
In addition, occupied the "Empörten" a New park, which is at the crossroads of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue in the vicinity of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, the New York and New Jersey, and the property of the Trinity Church.

The mayor defended himself in his grey conducted evacuation of the Zuccotti Square, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and it was decided, because the demonstrators" contravened the law. "
Bloomberg said that he had given the order to the evacuation of the place, because he "had turned into a place where people were not Demonstrieren, but to break the law and, in some cases, other people to harm," because "some shops have received threats" and the residents began to "about their quality of life."
"The evacuation of the dawn was sickening and shows that Bloomberg is essentially on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in protecting the interests of the North American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, the mayor anschuldigte "not to respect the freedom of the press."
The leaders of "Occupy Wall Street informed that they thought about it," major actions "to organise for Thursday, together with community organizations and unions in the two months, the protests since 17 September now.
