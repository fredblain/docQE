The menu of a fettsüchtigen child: it is not eating breakfast and eats supper sausage
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Recent surveys have shown - obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a human environment, where he breeds and the examples are surrounded.
On the tables of adipöser children sausages were up to half more often on the table than in families in which normalweighty children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children were on the eve of the information campaign under the slogan "obesity is not a coincidence" chips for dinner.
In families with Dickerchen also sport not exactly the favorite activities, but also, the majority of today's students - only 15 percent said that their parents at least once a week to find time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year at the end of the school year, nearly 900 children from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of action "obesity is not a coincidence," which will be supported by the general health insurance company and the company Unilever.
So far, the project is more than 12 thousand pupils from 4th and 8th classes.
Unhealthy diet and lack of movement in the family are key factors that are responsible for the alarming increase in the number of children who are overweight or obesity.
"Only half of the surveyed children, for example, five times a day, the modus zweites frühstück Frühstück-Mittagessen-Vesper-Abendbrot - one of the main conditions for a healthy diet," is one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively minor matters, such as the regular breakfast time of the family are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic have breakfast but only 23 percent of the families of the students.
And, in most families, everyone frühstückt for themselves.
The worst was the fact that is not gefrühstückt in every tenth family.
The breakfast is the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test, among other things, the that the families of overweight children consumed more often unhealthy chips.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drink every day sweet soft drinks (70%) 
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed sport, but only less than half of their parents do - only 15 percent.
Just think your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), offered opportunities for appetite and view their own menu.
"As far as Czech children between 12 and 15 in terms of nutrition, is a far cry from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favourite foods were many flour foods, meat dishes and, of course, fresh food.
"What is alarming is the great popularity of sweet fizzy drinks," in the final report on the survey.
At lunch, the main court, pasta just before poultry.
Pulses liked children virtually nonexistent and the popularity of fish and vegetables courts as lunch was very low.
Hinkehr health
At the same time, the survey showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits, if they get the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants, the questionnaire after the informative lecture" obesity is not a coincidence, "in many cases, was a significant shift of preferences to principles of healthy diet," is in the results of the project.
This was, for example, in the sweet Limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The U.S. military in the questionnaire is also much more chicken or fish as a main course of the day and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
