Brand story:
The innovator IBM enters into the second century of its existence
Wanted to you looking for a suitable word, that the strategy of IBM most accurately characterized, then this would be the word "Longevity" probably.
For the general public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, known as a modern company, although already a century has elapsed since its inception.
Already their first chef - the visionary Thomas j. Watson sen laid the Foundation to this longevity.
Already he was the slogan that numerous global problems could be easily solved if people would be willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" was to a trademark, the life of the future giant should take place (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine to publish began at IBM already in 1935).
This was also the basis of the corporate culture that is thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle move to the future."
IBM survived and was successful because it has stayed true to its principles and was not afraid to change anything else round about also a whole century.
That allowed us, in the course of our first century, the technologies to transform business and society.
"We hope that we create even more in the next hundred years", said Samuel j. Palmisano, the current Director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary.
Sophisticated system
Watson operation already in the 1930s social care of his employees - in a similar way as the entrepreneur Bata in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid leave, insurance by the contractor plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and an ingenious system of remuneration for the best innovators and dealers.
Long-term relations of IBM are just as sophisticated with their customers.
The company was from the beginning, awesome in the talent - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM picked up any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the top of IBM alternated next year by a woman from Virginia Rometty.
Which is already 30 years at IBM, so far she took up the position of sales, marketing and strategy manager.
IBM makes adult's so-called online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas there enough, almost half a million people is employed in the company.
An institution with good reputation
Its unshakable position in the business the company guarantees a strong image and this towards the inside and to the outside.
"The concept of an institution, as a mere technology company from the outset had IBM rather", Economist said the Professor of Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems by using of technologies", George colony added to by consulting firm Forrester research.
As the company itself emphasised, is there a difference on the market to be only present or to shape him directly by this presence.
IBM - in the States of their logos due to familial "big blue", in a century has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies at all - IBM developed hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting, and consultation services in an incredible product range - from servers to nanotechnology.
From all us technology companies, IBM has the most patents and already five of its employees were awarded the Nobel Prize.
Among his most famous inventions such as ATMs, credit cards, Finanzswap, bar code, or also the disk.
With approximately $220 billion market capitalization (market capitalization) IBM this year was the second-largest technology company (immediately after Apple), which it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The view ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers – unhappy were for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service prodigy or the computer IBM PC Jr.
"Business is based on the forward motion, so you must bind itself not emotionally to the past," said Samuel j. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problem to build its foundations on various platforms - and to leave them if they don't work, again.
In contrast to rival Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system stands or falls.
Promising technologies
The profits from IBM services participate to a great extent, software and hardware to participate to each one-fifth.
It was still 1990 most represented hardware containing more than fifty prozentigem.
Since 2000, IBM sold theirs off little gain in assets valued at $15 billion, at the same time, however, it invested $58 billion in the purchase of future-oriented technologies.
In these investments, IBM will continue after 2008 as swept the modern financial crisis for the first time like a storm across the world.
Also IBM remained the legacy of his first Chief Thomas j. Watson, increased the amount of its investment in the middle of the great depression.
So far, it seems that the company IBM without prejudice to survive today's crisis.
The value of IBM shares rose like a rocket since 2008 by 120 percent and net income of the company grows kontinuell.
The customers of IBM is: everything can change - only the values do not.
Also, it can be expected that this flexible giant masters the next crisis.
IBM history: from the cheese cutter to space flights
Initially, the company IBM (international business machines) founded one hundred years ago in New York had a rather complicated name - computing Tabulating recording Corporation.
She assumed the name of IBM until 1924 – originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The merger of four companies, whose history dating back to the eighties of the nineteenth century laid the Foundation for the later company IBM.
They had technologies such as for example the famous Stechkarte clocks to register the start and corresponding.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, which held until 1930 also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board.
And it was Flint, who was the head of the rival firm Thomas j. Watson, so that this helped him in the direction of the company.
This leader then even the founders of IBM in the shadows - on Watson's ideas was based until today the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name reveals, the production and the distribution of all possible machines for trading - sausage and cheese cutters up to cash registers.
He doubled their sales to nine million dollars in the first four decades, in which Watson led the company, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company whole forty years sitting in the Executive Chair, until he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop of artificial intelligence to work and developed also the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computer from IBM NASA helped to direct flights into space - the mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of people to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with same computer architecture - the series of IBM System/360 in 1964.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of at the time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its PC production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand however bought the Consul tante part of the PricewaterhouseCoopers company and entered the hereby fully in the business consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that pays off IBM in the past three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet".
It is the intention to use technologies in a clever way in so far not even planned areas, also to improve the situation in the transport sector and in the city administration.
In the trade sector IBM introduced recently the platform "Smarter Commerce", is designed to help dealers manage the commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the Czech Republic.

Today, IBM operates Czech Republic, including a strategic outsourcing Centre in Brno.
Moved the Head Office for Central and Eastern Europe in Prague and also a top team of world-class, located here that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
