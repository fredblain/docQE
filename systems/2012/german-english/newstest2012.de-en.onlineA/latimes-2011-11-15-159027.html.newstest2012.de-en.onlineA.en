Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health laws, as court takes case
A day, around which the Supreme Court behind closed doors gather, to discuss the question of political sharing, whether it will hear a challenge of health laws by President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas attended, a dinner, which sponsored was by the law firm that represented the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when met all nine members to a meeting to discuss the petitions to the test.
One of to treated cases was an action which raised 26 States against the far-reaching health care reform last year adopted by the Congress, a law that anywhere was at the conservative activists in the United States a buzzword.
The judge agreed to the hearing. Actually a 5 is expected in March 1/2-hour basis for discussion, that probably will stimulate probably 2012 the presidential campaign whose outcome, which will be in full swing at the time at which the Court's decision is announced,.
The lawyer who before court and claim, that the law is to tilt, probably Paul Clement will, once Attorney-General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the federalist society, a long-established group, dedicated to the defense of conservative principles.
Another undertaking, the dinner made, Jones day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of independent business, which challenge the law.
An another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., is greatly involved in financially as a result of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the Court about the case had advised, in a Washington Hotel.
Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a declared opponent of health care reform, among others had service
Dinner guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: for years, the two judges attend events of the federalist society.
And that would not violate moral rules.
Indeed to judge of the code of conduct free, which governs the actions of the lower federal judge.
They were there, they would fall probably 4 (c) of the code under principle, which States the following: "A judge may on fundraisers law near and other participating organizations, where the judge no speaker, guest of honour or according to the program, not a guest of such events may be."
Nonetheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas were to two of related the case relating law firms as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this from, to alert the morality and Government activists.
"This amazing break with morality and the contrast with the code lie punishes the actions of some judges, the Court think the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won and dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings of the Court."
Their occurrence and their support of a fundraiser for this event undermined any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they would too easily mix legal issues with groups that be guided from the agenda, like for example the federalist society.
And that Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
However, claim the Conservatives that it was judge Elena Kagan, have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was Attorney General under the Obama rule, the first law disputes in the first instance court.
Their critics urged Kagan to withdraw themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it involved too much in defense of the law, to be impartial.
Kagan makes no move to do so.
