Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM developed modified Asphalte with polymers to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature changes
Would the attention on the characters that emanate from the road surface, it would be unnecessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana erupts del Valle de México (part of Mexico Valley), said Rafael Herrera Najera, researchers at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured, that when laying out and maintenance of asphalt covering adequately happen, the number of potholes are significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a technical perspective" which he delivered on the occasion of the international year of chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, develop modified Asphalte with polymers, to establish a mix similar to the asphalt that, however, has a greater mechanical resistance at high as well as at low temperatures.
Herrera Najera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, as for example, in some cities in the North of the country, should be used to improve the behavior of pavements and thus avoiding the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of oil - is a hydrocarbon of the part of a high molecular weight has - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of a low - the so-called Malthene. Together, they impart the road surface its characteristic visco-elastic behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of asphalt means that it behaves at high temperatures of almost 180 ° C like a liquid, at 120 ° C it is very viscous and almost fixed at 50 ° C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
The chemical engineer carried out "Which means that the resistance of asphalt on the streets is not uniform, but depending on the weather conditions and temperature changes in a day,".
The researchers of the FQ noticed the streets of Mexico City have a flexible road surface, which are drawn from six layers of material, of which the last three asphalt included majority.
A wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small, bathed in asphalt and then paved stones lie between the top layers.
Each individual stones this wearing course had been bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move out and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better", said the chemical engineer.
"About the wear layer", he carried out "A last layer is designed, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. made of sand, which was bathed in asphalt."
Because this layer in contact with the tyres, they need a higher mechanical strength than the wear layer, and she must make friction.
That this road surface receives the most forces and distributed, the base layer also requires an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made, must be maintained are.
"Weather conditions, especially humidity, and temperature fluctuations, are more important to consider factors, above all the water," said he, "because it substantially affect the behavior of the wearing course."
If the terrain is humid, water penetrates into the layer and comes out just trying again. This causes a softening of all layers of pavements and as a result the appearance of potholes.
"If a pothole", he said, "The surface is worn off first, while the wear layer is affected then." "But the damage occurs immediately, but is a process that should be maintained at the first sign by appropriate maintenance programmes."
The Member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (national research system Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause for the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of pavements always in relation to the vehicle load must be, and it must be ensured that to avoid by frequent potholes this rule is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research wait could, for example, of asphalt emulsions, which are in other countries already on the market, and that repair the potholes easily and without applying high temperatures did.
