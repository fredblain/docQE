The scandals the Zürisee Bank
The most adventurous Bank of Europe sits not in Italy or France, but in the Switzerland.
UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then slithers from one crisis to the next.
Now, a German is to set it.
So it had not thought themselves safe Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was in July become known, that he join a new job almost as spectacular 2013 would: Chairman of the Board of the Swiss banking giant UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised the Switzerland whether her beauty and the UBS whether their newfound solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the turnaround".
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But in September it became clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all the Bank's security systems and approximately 1.7 billion euros of audited.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, a banker marxloh not only in the Switzerland, had to go.
The President of the Board of Directors of UBS considered since then also defeated - and all ask: when will at last Axel Weber?
Already, it was announced that Weber must advise the Bank of February 2012 to.
And he takes over the Presidency of the Board of Directors already in may - not only in the year 2013, the Bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is hard.
Instead, it is not a banker, Professor of Economics and central bankers and would have certainly needed a training period.
In one fell swoop he then takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a Bank, which just once again proved that long ago "largest scandal Bank of Europe" deserves the title.
Because UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, she was the biggest asset manager in the world — and on the other hand slides for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems is saving the once-proud Swiss Bank.
It all began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager had combines them with ambitious goals: you wanted to be a big number also in investment banking.
So managed the UBS 2007 with $1.6 trillion customer vermögender more money than any other Bank in the world.
And on the other hand it was advanced as an investment bank in the League of the world's largest banks.
This made impression.
The former banker and later longtime Professor of banking in Zurich told Hans Geiger: "My students I found out UBS then always as an example of a good Bank."
"From today's perspective, you ask yourself: how could I be wrong just so?"
He erred tremendously.
In 2007, it was for the first time revealed that something went wrong part in UBS.
Middle of the year Chief Executive Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, which was until then considered high intellectuals and equally brilliant banker.
A few months later you knew why he had gone.
The investment division of the Bank had the audited themselves with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder that, UBS announced a capital increase amounting to no less than 13 billion Swiss francs.
It found they actually investors however which, would have wrinkled on the many people until shortly before even the nose: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so secret that it not even learned his name.
But that was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The Bank had to new multi-billion dollar losses announce Chairman Marcel Ospel, 2006 the Board of Directors at the second-best paid the Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: the UBS faced collapse in the face of their bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the State.
The National Bank bought from UBS for tens of billions problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation were six billion Swiss francs for a forced-convertible bond which she could become co-owner of the Bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed it is dramatic for a small country, if it is home to large banks.
Finally, the total assets of UBS was 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of the Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again we could not save UBS", says Bank researcher Geiger.
The first disaster the second joined.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with the United States and declared himself ready to give customers vermögender the data, who probably had moved behind taxes with the help of the Bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of $780 million - as repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions including criminal charge.
Thus the UBS known more or less openly, to have helped in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that had been their capital has always been in the competition for rich clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of Chief Executive and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of deposits.
So, the Bank had lost its credibility in both central divisions within a few months: in investment banking through the false speculation and asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just as it was a bit quiet, just as you thought, now the UBS will manage again, because this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single merchant shipping audited EUR 1.7 billion, before the Bank realizes that something has gone wrong.
And it will be obvious: with the risk management in investment banking it doesn't obviously always still.
"With the fall of Adoboli one has realise that controlling risk has changed too little", says Martin Janssen, an economist and Professor of finance at the banking institution of the University of Zurich.
Also the CFO of a major German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that she has the control not under control."
While it had been but just the idea of caution, with the Swiss came to bankers long ago, to be guardians of the great assets of the world: no excessive risks, ensure security for the money - the world liked break down beyond the Alpine Republic times.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the stereotype of the elegant Swiss private bank - it is just a bit larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank is headquartered at the Zurich railway station road, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are palatial, the shop rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks reside here: by the National Bank of the Palace of the Credit Suisse up to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
Entering the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble streamlined, prior to that, thick leather chair next to the Bank logo are a great sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what is looking for the customer here: security.
Two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have displaced but eventually this idea of the Swiss bank - or betrayed as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
Rather he wants to read his name in the newspaper, finally he makes business like all Swiss Bankers, also with the two big banks.
UBS has become far too big, he - finds particularly in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss would have to say nothing more.
"And if they are, they have adapted long customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact it was investment banking which changed the UBS, earned her first high profits, and then the debacle the Anglo-Saxon: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub prime jungle such as the Swiss banking giant.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was visible.
"On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small country of seven million decided the largest bailout in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS Crash".
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or around 45 billion euros granted the politicians to save the standing before bankruptcy major bank.
How could it happen?
Talking with Swiss Bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks teamed up to a huge group.
It was a bank that was too big on the merger grew for the small Switzerland - and always on.
Helped that two different precursor banks of UBS complemented himself: a rich, but sleepy Bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers conveniently came to much money they could use to turn a giant wheel.
Two names are connected with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 CEO of UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought, Wuffli and Ospel had a dream team", says Bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectuals, humble, who understands much of models and statistics and Ospel, the belly man who is above has worked up by the banking apprenticeship until quite."
But Ospel had rely finally on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: high spirits came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the managers meetings, where CEO Wuffli were repeated from same slogan: Goldman Sachs come from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful Investment Bank in the world.
It led to the "League tables", leaderboards, documenting the success of the banks of at the time.
Then, UBS wanted to at the top.
Some steps were already succeeded her.
In the foreign exchange and equities trading she starred at the top.
Management consultant, which were commissioned, but stressed a weakness: in the international business of interest, in the language of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance to the biggest banks.
UBS have gaps in American mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that the existence of almost cost them.
Hungry invested for growth, both the Bank itself as well before their based hedge funds in American subprime assets.
It developed itself into a huge machine, which packaged securities based on us mortgage loans and submitted further - retained risks but also themselves.
Even when other banks long searched for the phase-out.
"UBS there has bought in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market on fire,", says Bank expert violinist.
So great euphoria, so the case deep.
A Manager after another had to go as the attempts to clean up were harder than expected.
Post at UBS became the ejection seat and are still shaky.
Who leads the banking giant, has a nearly impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a Bank, which all nearby business models are on hand come.
Bank research Geiger has already an idea: an end to investment banking, focusing on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
Quite so far the Bank wants to not go though (yet).
But the investment banking is to shrink significantly, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new Bank Chief Sergio Ermotti of the world will present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was intended only as a temporary solution, as the Bank is surprisingly by predecessor Grübel separated.
In the meantime he has prevailed: he is to permanently carry on the business of UBS, Zurich Bank communicated on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return mid-nineties to the Investment Bank to the State.
He deletes 3500 places.
This is not enough however.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What will she make money?
These are the questions, which now already turns Axel Weber.
Publicly, he only says he will look once an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
