21 House in Vienna
The Pavilion drawn to
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with UPS, downs and happy ending: Of Brussels in 1958 of the Austrian Expo Pavilion won prices, became the Museum in Vienna, stood empty and degenerated.
He is now reopened as an exhibition venue.
If modern post-war architecture, carried by clear forms, glass halls, courageous turns and new building materials, that are typical for the faith in technical progress, then the Austrian Pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels world fair is a true and famous example of 1958.
Schwanzers Pavilion got at that time the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its slightly and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made known the architect so that the built Austrian Pavilion at the next world's fair.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus Bowl-like outhouse in Munich, he became famous in 1973 finally internationally.
His Pavilion planned as a temporary exhibition had after the World Exposition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Station erected, converted and opened in 1962 is a Museum of the 20th century - it was called the "1920's House".
Suitable but was neither spatially and technically as a Museum - no walls hang the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used as long until the contemporary art in Vienna got a new House.
Since 2001, the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has converted the Pavilion, he is now called "21 House" and is used in the future as a Museum for contemporary art.
Dienstagabend, the Belvedere Museum, to which belongs the House, opened the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every way there.
By Agnes Husslein-Arco has the new beginning, was the 2007 new Director of the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, Ph.d. by art historian with considerable career and others in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum, and a founding Director of the Museum of modern art was the tag Salzburg, strongly politicians and heritage protectors, she procured public funding and private sponsorships, and set the use.
Except for contemporary art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous Foundation should be issued, there should be a cafe and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built to do so.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was then the ideal person for the implementation.
Not only because he had Joseph Olbrich secession in Vienna sensitively converted and extended, and won the competition, but because he studied at Schwanzer at Vienna University of technology and the Pavilion for him was a "hugely important place" where he "almost every weekend" had looked at the exhibitions.
He knew the original draft, and he knew the problems of the building lost at his transfer to Vienna and its conversion to generosity and lightness.
At the current change, there were far bigger problems: the building was "an energy spin", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, used glass-reinforced insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special safety glass.
Bridges steel beams are strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets were renovated.
Two underground floors took place for the new use, a sunken light trench between home and street ensures the exposure, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building.
The original exterior doors have remained, the House is painted in the old reddish rust colour.
And the cinema is even still exactly as he was earlier.
And all under strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and is cheap and liked also the historic preservation Office", says Krischanitz, and points to a bumpy floor in the basement.
Despite all constraints, problems and modifications, the building has remained flexible and light.
It had been difficult with the Pavilion "which came therefore from Brussels" Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop in-the-city history".
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and wants nevertheless "a real consciousness awaken".
In this case, however, the 21 House not in the wrong place, is because it has occurred a urban fluke: to the Swiss garden around is just the newly planned "station hotel", with Office and residential buildings.
And an other godsend is perhaps still enter: 21 House could get amplification of an another Krischanitz build, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought Temporäre Kunsthalle Berlin, and as we hear, she negotiated with the city a neighbourly site in the Swiss Garden.
