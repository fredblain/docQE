No liberating novel for Tymoshenko by the Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to abolish those clauses in the context of a revision of the Penal Code on the basis of which the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been sentenced.
The members of Parliament at the second reading of the application to mitigate the punishments for economic fraud rejected the new rules which would have can pave the way for the liberation of the imprisoned ex-Prime Minister.
Timoshenko had been sentenced to seven years in prison in October due to the conclusion of a supposedly negative contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, the appeal of the condemned in court should be negotiated in December.
Timoshenko itself referred to the ruling as political revenge of the regime and also in the West of the process was the suspicion of bias of the Court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365, the former Prime Minister was convicted on the basis, of the Penal Code was supported by 147 members.
226 Votes would have been necessary to its adoption.
