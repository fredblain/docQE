7 Lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve jobs on 5 October, some comparing it to Henry Ford and thereby stressed the engineering genius as a large modern inventor.
What Apple fans but perhaps most aufschlussreichsten find jobs-interview recently again discovered, which was dusted down this week before special film screenings in the major markets, is how much this creative mind understands business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organiser who worked diligently on charts - a man who believed that many Managing Director suffer from "a disease of thought", "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work..." [but] there is a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product.
1995 developed Bob Cringely TV-series "Triumph of the specialist" on the dawn of the personal computer. And he sat with longer than one hour jobs, where they led a rare, detailed discussions.
At this time were as 10 years passed since jobs from Apple was marginalized. And he was already hard working on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the wide adoption of the Internet.
While a small part was used by Cringleys interview in specialist, he says that the copy templates of the interview in the delivery were missing.
Only after jobs death discovered a full copy of the VHS in the garage of the Director.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68minuetigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview", which is this Wednesday and Thursday at the landmark theater.
For someone who has known that he abhors extensive interviews, jobs appears here surprisingly eager in explaining his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview there is 10 or 15 seconds contemplation, where jobs weigh his thoughts clearly and order accuracy is trying four times longer pauses between question and answer.
There are also moments in which jobs' perfectionism is days when he seemingly impatient responds to Cringelys questions and it anschubst, to respond faster to issues or subplots of greater significance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone recorded the lost interview appears somehow weird far-sighted if jobs rated, what do other companies of in his view true or false and represents its own vision on the future of the computer.
It is one thing to read posthumous tributes of career jobs'. But here to see jobs, who is on the verge of greatness, as the greedy dreamer is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he everything had done this here, he moved off and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:
He learned how to run a business:
"During the whole year in the business, I always ask:"Why you are doing things?"." And the answer that you get always, is: "Oh, so it is done simply."
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really in-depth thinking about things.
I've found that.
Further, jobs performs his efforts to streamline the accounts at Apple.
Dumbfounded, as costs were recorded - usually began with standard cost"", were estimated at a mere presumption towards, which were then adapted with "Deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which ensured that the costs could be determined up to the smallest.
How was ridiculing the Pope:
A device with which one could creep into the telephone company and long distance lead free tells of the "blue box", which he has built with Steve Wozniak, jobs.
Much has been written about the device, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the blue box as an act of empowerment is infectious.
He also describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a pay phone, make a call and is then connect by an AT &amp;amp;amp; T network to another while she grinding as many satellites as possible through.
"We sent things a half a dozen times around the globe and when you gr√∂lte in the phone, it came out a minute later next door back in the phone," chuckling tells jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we ourselves can build something, that can control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both, we knew not much but we were able to build this small thing that can control a giant thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think that Apple would be without them.
Jobs retold from a glorious prank the Wozniak and he almost had deducted, when she called box in the Vatican in the dead of the night via blue and wanted to speak with the Pope, while it as best they could have made to Henry Kissinger.
Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the dead of night to talk with the American diplomat, the two had to laugh off before the Pope himself on the phone came.
As he fell in the technology (and unprepared called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts, to build a frequency counter, he sought Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, jobs got a part time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable influence on me." "It was the only company that I'd seen in the age and it shaped my views about what was a company and how well it treated its employees."
Later became jobs of one of HP employees who visited the laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer that ever made".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell in love in him.
I would climb upwards at HP as a teenager and hang on this machine, and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview talks jobs in, how you invent spontaneously new products.
Early in his career, when he built some boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment of only 30 days and had to think through both the Assembly and the delivery of the finished devices.
Later at Apple he remembers the problems that he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember disruptive arguments..." "They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse, that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we build them for $15. That was incredibly believable.
About large companies that allow to:
Long before he revive Apple, jobs predicted the paths on which so many industrial giants with their visions came in tripping and lost control of their shares.
"We say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, na and?"
Have the monopoly on share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so [there are such people], which eventually lead the company and the product with which the people from decision-making are pushed.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly is eradicated vs. bad products, people who have no concept about good products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have to have the entire computer industry.
You could have ten times greater, could have the Microsoft of the 1990s...
You have caught defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"A lot of handicraft, situated between a great idea and a great product... If you developed this great idea, she changed and is growing."
You can learn much about its intricacies.
You shall provide votes, certain things that you can't, but electrons, robot, glass factories.
You must memorize 5000 terms, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Ultimately it boils down to the taste, it boils down to that one, apart sits down with the best stuff that people have created, and then seeks to bring together these things on what to do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made great Macintosh, was that the people who work there, musician, poet, artist, zoologist, historian were, which happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It was not the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
