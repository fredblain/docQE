Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in defense
Defense Minister Leon Panetta heated up the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. Thus, he unleashed a financial chain reaction of the halls of the Pentagon to the battlefields in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon thinks through reductions in the amount of $450 trillion during the next decade already, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more necessary be if Congress did not graduate issues can be achieved.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the Ministry", Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure would lead to 23% overall reductions, as well as an end to numerous new projects.
"Such a high reduction performed in such reckless ways, would most of our ship and construction projects make unenforceable - you can buy not three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily separate us from most of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with certainly, to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously harm."
"The cuts were ultimately the combat forces meet", Panetta said.
"While the war time quotas in the fight for against terrorism by the seizure are not directly affected, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort", Panetta warned.
"Recruitment have been reduced, which would lead to delays in the settings and the setting's attendant, who support the war."
"Would cut the salaries of staff resulting in late payments to war time traders and legal as well as political support would be disturbed."
The two Senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of defence.
"The consequences of the confiscation of the Defence Ministry would launch a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military power in the world."
"We are strongly against this draconian action", said the senators in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they released the Panetta letter.
"This is a result with which we can not live, and it is certainly none that you should push us up."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and whose occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta letter and the new warnings of senators will increase the pressure on a compromise on the budget or demands will, step up to take the Pentagon cuts, remains to be seen.
Panetta has expressed increasingly bluntly the possible cuts, although he could gain experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House many years before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he is serious decisions to.
At a press conference last week, the Defense Minister painted a grim picture of what could be - come a military shell, but without core.
"There is a ship without sailors."
"It is a Brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings, and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers who are able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force lacking morality and alert and that is not in a position to take on potential opponents."
"You can get a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta spearheaded new details, such as reductions "creates significant operating risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious limitations of our global deployment and intervention capabilities, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects of strike victim could fall including those that already have been tested and are already in the early planning stages.
This list includes also the fighter pilot strike fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the army and Navy need F35 joint to replace the Humvee.
Would you stop the continued development and testing of the F35, would this over the next 10 years save up to $80 trillion, but proponents say it is an important next step for upgrading, so that cannot be dispelled by China and other opponents possible dangers.
