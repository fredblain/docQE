Walls have eyes: how researchers watch on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many guys who sent their anti immigration opinion online.
On Monday Breivik, who has been committed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have, where 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has much time spent to his attack before his computer and chatted with some of the millions of nationalists, who support extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how to find it?
This is easy - you must log in only on Facebook.
"We have noticed that it was not difficult to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report of the British think-tank DEMOS of digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply must use the advertising tool of page, to set your desired demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - so how marketers for years do it.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing extremist groups throughout Europe and she proposed to then adds, but instead of going with a new band or a new diet product to link, the adds invited users to a survey, in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and assessing their own future was asked.
Bartlett and his colleagues able to consult more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without them even once had to leave her Office were thanks to Facebook.
"It is a new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprising. Online sponsors of right-wing extremist groups are mostly young, male and fret about immigration.
But in a surprising twist "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism rational, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is just one example, as Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, scientist and medical researchers are using the site, to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in "Likes", text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add three content per day on average, Facebook's "Data Supernova" generates a research boom, who in the past five years to nearly 800% increase in the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the title.
For some researchers, it is beauty of Facebook the fact that one can study through this site people, that is usually not reached his Clipboard on the road.
"If you previously tried to interview people of the British national party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to first inform the party and would have granted never access them," Bartlett says.
"On Facebook falls it all away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the page provides a way to identify social health problems and to solve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken stupor on Facebook tend significantly more to the problem drinking as students who were silent on this subject.
Moreno proposes equal students, such as the residential Advisor, to monitor the page and help a student when they post too many status updates.
"You can not solve a problem, if you have not recognized", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno co-author and Director of child health, behavior and development at children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook taps constantly to the data of its own population.
The data team of page has created statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's day, turnout at the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (and first and foremost information were used, that only Facebook has access - master of digital freedom for a long time know that the page should make available their large data found mine to others for research purposes.)
However, the users of Facebook know that the page they observed whether they now want that or not. With a friend who is thousands of miles away to be able to play Scrabble, to bring out the own personal data allows one the page.
But what, if the users of Facebook are part of a survey, which they don't even know something?
While researchers have laid down strict guidelines, how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think that many users of the fact thought that a researcher might study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge lab, a study from the year 2006, in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As regards it, went there only to them and their friends."
Then there is the question of the methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information provided in a user profile and contributions are true.
"What they say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two completely different things" says Selwyn.
Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology research that a Clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for this to get out into the real world and to speak with real people", he says.
"Social research must worry about the social - and social life of lots of takes place yet always offline."
