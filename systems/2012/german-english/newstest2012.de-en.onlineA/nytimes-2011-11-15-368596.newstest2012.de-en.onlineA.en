After an early mistake a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wore use helmets.
We opted for the night from Monday to Tuesday because at this time there are hardly any people in the Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials have been informed. All the others initially believed to take part in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was among them, and his presence underscored the fact that put the operation full of challenges.
The events of the last few weeks as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which is against the rules of the program and provided a huge increase in public sympathy with the squatters, allowed to repeat themselves no longer.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from the Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared them by they were watching how occupations in other cities were handled.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Iceland.
Officials increased the so called chaos training - measures to combat terrorism, including the quick set of a large number of police officers - to concentrate on lower Manhattan.
The last training session was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The command to move into the Park, came "at the last minute", said someone who with commanding the familiar is what spoke for a declaration as an "Exercise".
"The few police officers who I know were involved did not know that it went around the Zuccotti Park", someone who wishes to remain anonymous said.
"The only ones who knew that it went around the Zuccotti Park, were the senior officials of the Department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson that had come to the city.
On 14 October, officials wanted to give the Park, differed back then but, when hundreds of protesters along came after they had learned of these plans.
Officials of from different police units were involved in the operation Tuesday, including Einsatzkommando from throughout the city - hundreds of mobile official, usually used in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that in the course of the day, many people in the Park enter and leave, almost like commuters, so that 1 am is a good time in the night to go.
"It was appropriate to do so, if the minimum number of people in the Park," he said.
Ambulance with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the prerecorded messages that boomed from the speakers, many protesters seemed to intimidate.
As the public officials invaded their bright blue jackets in the Park, many protesters cover together simply their belongings and left the place.
Police said that by 1: 45 P.m. no tents would be handled, to give the protesters time to pack their belongings and goods together.
Other teams of officials were seen, how they are gathered in the area, to intervene, arrests in the Park should be necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the Park.
Paul j. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of police, said that this had happened to their own safety.
But many journalists say that you wanted to keep them from, to observe the police actions in the Park. And they said the handling of civil servants had been very rough.
Mr Browne said that television trucks had can make the Park photos in Church Street on the West side.
When were moving the police towards the West by the great confusion on personal things of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf, and bags with clothes, followed her the cleansing Department employees who picked up what was left.
Some protesters who refused to go were to dragged out there. Pictures about this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main core of protesters took position in the vicinity of the kitchen area of the camp in the Centre of the Park.
Some erected barriers and police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicentre of the camp tied together on her arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, said Mr Kelly.
Civil protection officials were called to lot what.
As Mr Kelly said, no arrests in the park were conducted until about 3: 30.
The evacuation was completed according to the police after 75 minutes.
Mr Browne said that 142 people in the park were arrested.
The most arrests occurred, he said, because of "Improper behavior and resistance to an arrest".
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph j. Esposito, the head of the Department, the highest uniformed official in the Department.
Phil t. Pulaski, Department Chief of detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence "Mr. Kelly directed" "the operation not", as Mr Browne said.
In the event that they should be accessed, waited a second group of officials on the East side of Broadway, between liberty and Cedar streets.
Barricades were erected at Cortlandt Street, a block north of the Park, and in the Pine Street, one block further South.
It could be observed as from these locations the police further expanded the perimeter around the Zuccotti Park around.
In one place many of them with obstruct, persons observed, as several officials after drove out there.
About 28 persons were located in the Northern District.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the South of the Park.
At 5 P.m. a protesters on the roof of a police vehicle jumped South of Pine Street and other protestors let out the air of the tyre of a police bus.
The amount a piece of plywood threw in one place.
At the end of an official and a protesters to the hospital came.
