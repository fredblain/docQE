How is revealed to be a lie
A look at the current headlines shows deception and lies in everyday life are how widespread concern and far.
The presidential candidate of the Republican, Herman Cain, is busy to tackle the allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
The direction of Penn State is accused of perjury because it allegedly has held back reports, according to which a retired football coach sexually has abused boys.
Last week was with a liar heard over an open microphone, as the French President Nikolas Sarkozy claimed the American President Barack Obama to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York Congressman and Internetexhibitionist Anthony Weidner made himself fool, when he installed ABDICATIONS in circulation, which were quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
The former presidential candidate of John Edwards is accused of violations in the campaign financing which is related to cover up an extramarital affair.
Then no one who has seen it, forgetting of course the media circus, which President Bill Clinton has thrown when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating in school and College exams are widespread.
There were incidents where teachers have given the exam responses their students, so that they were good even when their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite, sending a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception are we experiencing?
Studies show that we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies are but considered Marxist.
Another study shows that stranger lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
To detect lies or "to uncover lies" is one that is important for everyone to learn, both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game as away to such charades, in which it is the target, "don't you!" to call, the Enttarnen of a deception is a serious knowledge based on scientific data, which were collected in the course of the past six decades at prestigious universities, who conducted extensive research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that the most ancient myths about the lies were unmasked.
Lies look one in the eye.
You stutter, stammer, blush, and suffer not always.
From this we may not conclude but that these liars are difficult to uncover and to unmask.
A skilled LÃ¼genenttarner can penetrate to the truth by he learns about the structure of claims that the fine facial expressions, questions and timing.
I have spent several years to examine the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing range of exposure. And it is clear that the Enttarnen of a deception is a modern capability that is easy to learn and helps us in finding your way around in our complex world especially when setting or the request of persons or negotiations or management belong to the own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good to appreciate other people, arousing their interest and control own emotions. And they feel intuitively, as others are perceived.
Thanks to the research we, extroverted people lie more often than introverted people know that men dish up more often "self oriented" lies than women whose lying more "focus on other" - usually, so they want to protect the feelings of others-, that married people less often lie to their partner than unmarried people (but the lies that they tell are usually "fat lies").
We also know that, if a person as a culprit was revealed to be other less feel guilty, to have lied to this person.
How to detect, whether someone is lying?
First by you observe the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It is for a reference point to later evaluate changes.
Watch the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their subject.
They should know better when someone usually constantly trips with the foot, so that they not accuse him if he trips during a meeting with the foot.
Then look for clusters of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
See these clusters as alarm bells ringing, shrill as evidence an exposure.
People who deceive, maybe freeze when trying to remember their history. Perhaps have their feet towards the door or they sit in the direction of output, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, relaxing breath and the change in attitude, if all the hard questions are over.
Interrogative signal often erroneously that an interview is over, only to this relaxation after the interview to look.
Pay attention also to the language of your subject.
The crash of Scott Peterson is famous, as he used the past tense, as he claimed, his dead wife is live and triggered a national search for her.
Deceptive people can use a distanzierende language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman..." "Miss Lewinsky" or if you reviewed a tricky question in a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language", if they answer a tricky question: "well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know is... to the best of our knowledge and belief."
This, the answer is rather increasingly true as factual, which often ringing alarm bells.
There is no magic to the Enttarnen of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which an exposure is possible.
Thanks to these abilities, everyone can be rare victim of scam artists, both in the private like in professional life.
