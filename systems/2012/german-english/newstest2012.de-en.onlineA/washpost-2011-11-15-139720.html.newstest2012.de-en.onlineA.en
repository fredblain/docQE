Troops feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street Gala, which raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
Gathered on a keyword to one hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in black Tuxedo stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and servicemen were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the Gala, which was observed by the Chief of staff and former Chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, looked different to the role played by the troops.
"They were introduced such as orphans," wrote the officer in an E-Mail.
I'm sure the organizers have meant it well.
I know that.
But it really wasn't no respect. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the serious relationship between the military and the American public usually distanced, sometimes admiring.
The troops will be showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, say Dienstangehörige.
The general public behaves suffering increasingly so, as it did the people in uniform.
"We were not victims", said Brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in the Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently is the only way that support is the one to squeeze us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders who want to appear not ungrateful or in conflict with the public which they serve.
They have also recognized that the rage in recent years of the Viet Nam war against struck the returning troops, was much worse.
As a result, talks about compassion in the breastfeeding and private between veterans of war take place.
After his two sons from fights with the Marines have returned, the Colonel (Ret.) mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military realm could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would regard it with a sense of AWE as she rebels defeated and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "raging, violent veteran beneath the surface" hides, said Cancian, who had fought in the Iraq and has acquired a high State post in Washington after his return.
During his employment, he said he felt that some of the interviewers subtly erfragten whether he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep the negative impressions, however," Cancian explained his sons.
The missing ease of the military is rooted in part on behalf of the Americans in the war missing.
Services on the battlefield will be from a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little benefit in the wars in the Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out rarely as praise.
"We as a nation appreciate military heroism no longer so, as it was absolutely normal in the second world war", said Lieutenant General David Barno (Ret.), who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public focuses largely on the suffering of a Dienstangehörigen.
Troops gain recognition for the number of attacks that they have endured, the number of friends who have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
