So was the work of the physician who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
These officials work plays a key role.
On November 4 a Lophoskopist of investigation unit of the public prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionary armed forces of Colombia), entered into: "Alfonso Cano" through comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the Department of CTI, Eliazar Gonzalez had on call, a man from Puerto Tejada, who works with 21 years with criminal investigation this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonzalez worked in communities of Chocó, where he often five days had to go into the jungle, to reach the place, where the bodies were, that he should identify.
2000 he relocated to Valle and after the completion of the required courses he specialized in Lophoskopie, which is the study of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. of the palms and soles.
In the week of the use against the so-called Alfonso Cano Eliazar was pointed out to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night, he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that suspicion was that one could be that of the man of who had initiated the oldest guerrilla of the world. That is why he should take the ten-finger print page by Guillermo Leon Saenz (his actual name).
But reaching the place with the Untersuchungste, where the body was, he could not identify him due to his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, wearing no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the dead body with those on the imprint page.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
Still same night this from Puerto Tejada, man that was responsible to inform the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzon, that actually was the Chief of the FARC.
On search
For a Daktyloskopen of the SIJIN in Cali was evaluating to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the fight against "Cano" which was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The fingerprint data is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only bodies, support also investigation in murder and rape cases, and confirm the identity of the arrested person.
During their arrest, many offenders present false identification documents or they have none.
We take the fingerprints them and check them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to tear a piece of wall of a house in a theft, because the thief had relied on precisely at this point with his hand, as he pulled out a safe crowded with jewellery and money.
"Walls are difficult, because their surfaces for fingerprinting are inappropriate." He recalled, "but in this case we take the impression of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in several robberies".
Using the fingerprint also murder suspects can be relieved or charged.
Recently one death was surrounded by brandy bottles found.
In the calculation, it has been suggested that a member of the family could be tatverdächtig, and actually agreed a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the killer, so he is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that "the fingerprints with physical or chemical reagents of the object would be taken."
If they appear, a planting trowel or a tape is used to carry.
Then the prints on the Asif will be sent, which is the criminal database, or to the personal level Office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification documents," said the expert of the CTI.
He said that not everything is so as it would shown in the TV series SCI.
As not all the gold is what shines, is also not everything that it touches a fingerprint.
But nevertheless it can be used when one performs a relevant comparison.
