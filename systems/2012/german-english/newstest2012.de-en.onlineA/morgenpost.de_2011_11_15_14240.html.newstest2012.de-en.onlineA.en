Smart crows spread between cities
In many places, rooks are considered "Problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer distribute from the cities, experts claim.
Some love it, others want to get rid quickly: crows belong to the city for centuries, but in many communities, residential complaints pile of dirt and noise of animals.
It is a remedy for the "problem"birds not yet in sight.
Rooks were from the cities not out more to get, said experts at the first symposium of the Crow in the East Frisian leer.
There, specialists from all over Germany of possible resources advised.
Looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists attributed the problems in cities it also to the rural exodus of the specially protected rooks: the use of chemicals in agriculture are increasingly destroyed traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing construction and the cases of typical breeding trees the birds made difficult life.
Crows are.
There are large colonies more than 600 breeding pairs in the Westphalian Soest, in the Northwest in Jever, Diepholz, and Achim, near Bremen, among others, as well as empty.
There, a controversial project to the mass killing of crows in the district had 2005 created negative headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of animals in some and the slaying with clubs particularly brutal.
"Nothing brings the normal displacement, the Vergrämen," the urban and landscape designers detected empty Werner Klöver from.
Nests away spraying with water or trees cut, have often undesirable consequences, the environmental expert Manfred Emperor of Lahr in Baden-Württemberg, also said.
"The animals back out, split large colonies on and distribute elsewhere."
Vergrämung is conceivable only as an exception to hospitals, old people's homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we no longer get away."
Without the surrounding area leave does not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner out empty.
A combination of Vergrämen of animals from sensitive residential and bait advertising is possible to resettle them again in other places.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" recruited, however, the psychologist and anthropologist UTA Maria of Jürgens for an entirely different use of the animals: "we can finally best confidently endured A pimple on the face."
Had crows trail co-founded Jürgens in Schleswig-Holstein the ash's, where signs of life the highly intelligent rooks inform.
The project will now already adopted by tourists.
Also to the criticism of the noise of the birds, an opinion had Jürgens: "There is plenty of communication, who have to say much."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: rooks use tools not only to get a treat, but even make your tool as a tool.
Behavioural scientist of at Cambridge of University tested recently on four rooks, how far does the intelligence of birds.
In an experiment, the birds soon learned that they must bring a framework with stones down, so to obtain a moth larva.
Without much training, they realized purposefully what size and shape must have a stone to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows had to then solve a kniffligeres problem.
In a vertically set cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With its beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However the researchers had put pieces of wire them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, which they then angelten the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four rooks this was even at the first attempt.
