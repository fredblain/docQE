Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized so a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report in the Royal Society of Canada
The Panel stated that Governments, institutions of health care and doctors schmerzlindernder treatment worked together to provide the best subtle ways, and going beyond this also on the cases of the cancer.
The Canadian company lives in a rejection towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians can be adjusted fact, to talk about where they want to die with their doctor about conditions and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, the six experts were involved, which are linked together in different fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Panel recommends that the Government so to amend the Penal Code, to assisted suicide and to allow euthanasia, where it turns this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey of the independent company of EIU had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of Erdballes to each other.
Although Canada this has placed rank on the 10th, the study notes that "the medical care of death in Canada has produced a culture, where people are afraid to bring up the topic of death".
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, so tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority wish of Canadians at home to die, to die but ultimately 68.6% of these in the hospital.
Viewed from across the country made the rate 86% of deaths occurred in hospitals in the Quebec is the highest.
The authors of the report are conclusions which are opposite directions to make the position of the Federal Government, which has already geäuβert, no changes of the criminal code with regard to euthanasia and carriers commit suicide, in the thorny issue with regard to euthanasia and carriers commit suicide.
But now according to the experts, gleichermaβen have inspected all of those countries, whose Ansatz of euthanasia and assisted suicide a legalized or decriminalized there have, no evidence that such decriminalisation would bring Miβbräuche in their application, so implementing the practice of euthanasia or escort suicide by incompetent or not consenting persons to.
On the contrary, one far more cases of such violations in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide is not legalized, as yesterday meet Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,".
"Also accompanied suicide practiced in Canada, although this clearly illegal", Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us according to an Angus Reid survey carried out in the year 2010 already 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia geäuβert had themselves, as they are of the opinion that they allow to soften it persons at the end of their releases, their suffering.
And 66% believe that the facts of a legalization of euthanasia the effect has to convey that the lives of elderly or disabled people less besäβe the message.
In terms of those who have already practised an assisted suicide, respondents 41% believe that they not should be prosecuted.
As regards maintenance or adjustment of resources for patients, presents itself clearly situation as less, so the author of the report.
As well, they suggest in their recommendation that in the Penal Code should be specified, that the setting down of the means for a legally valid rejection have been, should not be considered criminal.
The Expert Panel also requires that health care in the task be trained should, to respect a weaning of funds at the end of life, and to this must fear without prosecution.
The Panel stated that Governments, institutions of health care and doctors schmerzlindernder treatment worked together, going beyond the best subtle means to provide, and this also on the cases of cancer.
Last calls for the Panel in terms of resources applied already in the Canadian institutions to health care deeply for pain relief or lebensabschlieβender measures, at least to consider them because they were as little as euthanasia used to reduce physical pain, and they refer to the same procedures.
Reservations other experts
Some experts on the area of the law of health care have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report unterzeichnenden experts among others as "extreme" because it set no limits the practice of euthanasia in patients in the final stages.
"This anyone who is Wesley and older than 18 years, to ask, to assist him in his suicide someone else opens the doors to a situation in which", so RA Deschamps, who yesterday had seen through a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also emphasised the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values which are involved in the social fabrics of society.
But now, he says there would be "Guidelines and obligations in society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist in health law, brought also a "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report expressed that they dubbed as "Pro euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, which itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada doubts to in particular the report details regarding the non vorliegens abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
