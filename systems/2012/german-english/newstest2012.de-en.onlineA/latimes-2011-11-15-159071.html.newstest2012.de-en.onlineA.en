Sister of Mexican President apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa María Calderón claimed that drug traffickers helped opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for Governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderón has apparently lost their bid for the Office of Governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results of the institutional the Revolutionary Party, the PRI, Fausto Vallejo has won the race for Governor in the Western State.
Luisa María Calderón said "The intrusion of organized crime during the entire electoral processes, and especially in yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our employees in the polls..." "They have booths occupied, roads built up... and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled the Presidency seven decades in Mexico, until they in 2000 lost.
But they strive for a return and in Michoacán, the victory is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have just defeated Claderon, which still led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN of her brother refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic Revolution Party, PRD, the currently incumbent Governor, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left lead for the presidential election came in third place, 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the provisional results.
Vallejo, former Mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denying links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán for a long time was ruled by drug cartels, which specialize in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderón and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still continuing.
A PAN Mayor was killed a week before the election during an election debate for Luisa María Calderón and numerous candidates has risen out of fear from the local elections.
For the PRI victory strengthens the party, no matter, the elections in Michoacán also appear as distasteful.
The man probably represented the PRI in the race for the Presidency is Enrique Peña Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory can be boldly look us in the next year."
