A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, was of the opinion that the President Felipe Calderón have not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree-law with the details about the switch-over to digital terrestrial television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute launched by the Senate in the life was rejected because he was not the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the Court could decide on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality of. The law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which has been prepared by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, Decree-law proposed for unconstitutional to explain da for the radio and television regulations concerned the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible, which is why the decree-law would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law subject to.

With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies submitted a constitutional appeals against decree-law. After the adoption of the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Cordero applied Decree-Law no longer and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected also the complaint submitted by the Chamber of deputies without doing in the debate about the project for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible, to enter.

These matters, stressed, "made the action of the entire system required, according to the principle of the economic management by the State, they included a group of characteristics that put the Constitution into the hands of the central State Government."
She called to mind that many countries worldwide already had carried the digital switchover, through the Government, although they had highly specialized facilities.
