The threat is tangible
After the detection of the "Zwickauer cell" doubt Turkish media at the German rule of law.
A newspaper even mentions a "bloody ideology", which again live.
The murders of eight Turkish gang members and a Greek small businesses in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background.
This message is responded to in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and concern.
Because for many German Turks long dead geglaubtes the ghost returns thus: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993 there has been no comparable power with right-extremist background against Turks.
That there are xenophobia in Germany, was still never in question.
The right extremist network face-up but reveals proportions, whose Dimension is already impossible to predict.
"The bloody ideology lives on again?" headlined the Internet Edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", however, stressed that one of the perpetrators was an informer of constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities in the right-wing radical swamp might be involved.
Considered the Turkish village of Germany responded: you are reminded at the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish leaders in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In cheerful colours, the balance was staged as a story of success.
Since the reporting of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift to the 50th" reads the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which expounds the backgrounds of serial of murders.
Also the Germany Edition of the "Hürriyet" can not resist, making this Association.
"It begins to stink", is the title of the column by Ahmet Külahci.
It is stressed that people were murdered, who paid taxes and would have made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The conduct of the police is extremely critical in German-Turkish Internet forums and discussed the later success of the investigation.
Why it not much more was invaded the German authorities, to search for suspects in extremist circles the authors wonder.
Some shows are at least rhetorically to drastic means ready: "If here continue to carelessly, nothing else is so migrants left as self-defence and arming".
"This will probably be the best self-defense".
"The quality of education and adequate punishment of the entire network of inner peace in Germany depends very strongly", writes "Selenium".
What does it mean if the inner peace in Germany in danger is, demonstrated the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in the memory of German and Turkish.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the we feeling on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time especially the failure of German policy was criticized after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
He sent a condolences to the President of the Turkish Republic, was represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel but at the funeral service in Cologne after the arson attack of Solingen - Kinkel listed at that time in his speech, how many charges were the local Turks.
So, as the value of a person calculate according to the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows, once again, the mistrust of many Deutschtürken in the local rule of law since then is how deep.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive clarification and reassessment of right-wing terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
