Mission ended, Congress prepared with regard to Libya communicate
It finally looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington were already, to communicate with regard to the riots in Libya.
Everything that was necessary for this purpose was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate approves a resolution, which is under the Chairman John Kerry (mass.) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), where it praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US troops for their "courage".
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya, who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.
"It's a confirmation of support its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far, nothing was easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers of both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a number of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission of NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain put forward a resolution which approved the limited use of military forces of the United States in Libya.
The law has been rejected by a broad fringe group of both parties in the Senate and there was no vote.
But on the same day this Bill in the Senate fell through. In addition, the Chamber overrode a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
Thus the U.S. Mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory â€” with a Congress that was indeed upset enough to criticize Obama's approach, within the framework of the mission but not angry enough to finally pull away the ground him.
Then, the indecision of the Congress of the events was overhauled.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
NATO's mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate is now perhaps ready to act.
Resolution of the Committee on international relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary endurance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners that support the military operations to protect of the people in Libya, for their exceptional bravery and their professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States on Libya a successful and irreversible transition to democracy".
Will the new measures receive the full support by the Panel for foreign relations or are they the lawmakers split, as did the law of June?
The latest version encounters the resistance of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), of the Committee's top Republican.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that he has still not seen the final version of the new law.
According to the United States Capitol, it lies on the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional Legislaturperiode of the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures under the leadership of Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or other area, which currently comes to a vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far unsuccessfully tried to bring their changes, although they have tried often enough to vote.
Goodlattes change is just one of 68 constitutional changes that were submitted to this Congress and include a whole range of topics.
Some are duplicated--the same law was presented to both the Congress and the Senate and others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the change in compensation budget and a further dozen that "would control federal spending" alone in the Senate.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they admit the possibility that their clients - especially beginners at the Republicans who want to Polish up your CV - brag that they "have authored such a measure".
The budget control Act, which was passed in August, requires that Congress about a change of equilibrium as well as Senate vote.
In March, 58 Senators for a non-binding resolution voted, supports the idea of such a change.
The budget also, some members want can submit the number of provisions, members of Congress, limit, while the Republican wants to remove the limit of two terms of President Jose E. Serrano (New York).
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has a number of changes proposed, which guarantee, inter alia, the right to a good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage under sex is a recurring template as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags.
Some legislators want to also allow the repeal of federal laws, if two-thirds of the States reject them.
As eager as the members suggest changes, so non-faster they move like in the past.
111. Congress submitted legislation of 77 such changes. 110. Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison with the early 1990s, in which members every two years suggested regularly more than 150 changes, so the numbers that makes the Senate library.
But they were not much better than today's.
The last change that add is - the 27-, ratified in 1992, proposed but in fact already in 1789 to the Congress.
