Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is being revised after exposure by the delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama Government has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada in the Gulf of Mexico, which one angered the unions and at the same time calmed environmentalists, the company be built the pipeline aims to reschedule the project so that you can return to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it will lead to the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the company was still confident that the pipeline is ultimately approved, albeit with a different course.
This occurred after an announcement of the Foreign Ministry last week, after the one you would postpone a decision concerning a federal approval for the project, until the new possible course is verified, which avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska, as well as the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, compared to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which has ordered the Foreign Ministry may postpone a decision until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, although officials deny that politicians in the decision were involved.
Obama said in a written statement that the decision is a task of the Foreign Ministry last week and said his support.
The 1700 mile pipeline was Canada with the Gulf of Mexico link.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
For this purpose, the pipeline would have to cross six States.
Environmentalists hate them, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislature of Nebraska, who are opposed to the plan, weigh the laws to force a move away from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that that has requested a separate probe of the review procedure with principal investigator of the Ministry that focuses on two questions.
One is whether a lobbyist who was recruited by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company was commissioned to carry out the original study, was an inappropriate choice because she is linked with TransCanada.
