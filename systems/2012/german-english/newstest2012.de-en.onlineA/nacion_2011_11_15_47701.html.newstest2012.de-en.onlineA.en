Read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full Abschrift is found in the online edition of La Nacion.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream realised, when Pearl Jam in Costa Rica plays: are you aware of you, what does this mean for your fans?
A dream that is carried out for us is to play in Costa Rica.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I have only once been to on vacation in Costa Rica. It is a so wonderful country that we will stay there for even a few days.
For us, it is exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you that because the fans of the band are completely revealed. Intensely enjoy the days before the concert.
What does it say your begeistertesten fans?
Thank you to stand all these years on our site.
It took us almost 21 years, until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you to have waited so long and sorry to have used, until we came here so long us.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Exert that not a bit pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have pointed out in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few big shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we have a desire to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle. For this, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How have their Costa Rica and its waves to surf learn about?
Many of our friends are surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends went to surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Along with Mexico are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned them.
With a view of the tour, you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because we there have never played, we set no limitations.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and our fans offer a good and varied repertoire.
You are never reviewed your repertoire.
Why?
I think this is partly so because we have nine panels, and you can play over 120 songs. An other song like everyone, so that the decision which we will each play, is not easy.
If we take two or three songs that we no longer have been playing in the repertoire, we can maintain better our concentration and they surprise us because they call the reasons to remind us why these songs have liked us. Otherwise, they could get into oblivion.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think also for the audience.
With this tour you celebrating your twentieth story.
If you look back, is it hard to believe you on your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I, that nobody has imagined by us once a great rock band to play in, and believe even over 20 years. That seems like a dream.
We also continue to this blessing and find it great to be able to make music together even now.
We like us and are excited to bring forth music.
We are lucky to be able to drive, we always wanted to visit the places of the world.
Things could not be better stand.
What it meant for you, to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has been always an honor to belong to this group of great bands.
We are friends with the people of Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Alice in chains.
It is surprising and unusually abundant, if a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is already unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time come from the same city.
We are proud to be, and are honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Soundgarden, we saw on their tour. We are pleased to be friends still with all of them, and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle sounds.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours so long remained together with same musicians.
Yes, four of us play since 21 years together and Matt (Cameron) came to us years ago. This is much more time than many bands survive alone.
First of all, I believe that we all of us lucky to be alive, and in addition, we look at each other.
We all are close friend why themselves musical way have opened, which give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. There could be no better us.
Your relationship to fame was not always easy. On the other hand you could make that thanks to your success what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way, as we have grown, has made it easier us to find a balance.
We will make sure to be not too often on tour because it is too easy this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to expire.
As long as you remember that the people because the music have come that reminds you that you need to take the music and what has called into being, not to be a famous rock star hell bent. That has interests anyway never us.
What memories do you have of your other project of mother love bone?
I believe we have written very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band that had never issued a plate until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) for three years.
We were disappointed to have needed so long. We are still always good with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us, friends. When I hear a song or see photos, I think what was Andy for an incredible person and brought me to laugh as he. It was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show at Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, have chosen especially Eddie Vedder and the band therefore for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos by several groups and this band we liked best. Therefore, we are curious to see, what Las live can provide Robertas. Exciting, which is determined.
The text of yellow Ledbetter why changing her always when you play live?
This is a question for ED (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing comes to him.
By whom were you influenced as a bass player?
So many +
The first covered me include geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon on the bass player that I like.
How has it managed Pearl Jam alive to keep the grunge, although it no longer is a fad?
I think we all feel not very connected with the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands fall a me, which I have mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important, I find that great because it's worth listening to this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music than ever before.
At first, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album, which may have a somewhat frivolous. But there are also other songs like the end or just breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they have also something positive in itself.
Both the tears came to me, when I heard how she played ed. There are very dark songs.
I think that when you're older and something Traumatisches in your life is happening - for example if you lose a family member or a friend - which affects your artistic creation and your music and these two songs that embody clearly for me.
I believe also that you can be a happy person and make still dark music.
