What represents the fraud in sickness?
After the family allowances, UMP and Government now take the sickness in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive on Tuesday, the November 15 in Bordeaux to consult a family aid Fund and to present a talk on the - since 2007 recurring - theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the State.
To accompany this attack, which originates from an effort to take the economy in a sample of hardness, on the other hand however no less Harbinger an axis of the right presidential campaign represents, wants the majority focus on employee ill message.
First of all with budget-economic objectives: the Government aims at the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking into account a notification for workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a diseased workers without approval of the specific company would lose the reward of four days, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that according to the daily "Les Echos" anger threatens to provoke, but would help to introduce EUR 280 million.
And which would go hand in hand with a different measure of rather symbolic character: the State officials a unvergüteten Karenztag in case of illness to grant (so far there are for them, in the Gegensatze to the three Karenztagen in the private sector, no waiting period).
While these questions in the discussion are available, the majority of new reignited the fraud issue, which this time is targeted at abuse associated with work absence.
"Checks will be far more important, and in addition they are to pay back, when it is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday that the November 13 before the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
The impact of this message in terms of the reality of fraudulent acts in the field of sickness a little disproportionate seem as also in other cases.
This is subject to permanent monitoring, as well as political offensives that have most frequently borne fruit in fact since 2002.
The French are no longer frequent sick than people elsewhere in Europe.
Stay but first in the nationwide figures.
According to the national health insurance by CNAM, more than 237 million euros daily payments were disbursed in 2006.
Pursuant of the institutes and documentation Institute of health presented the daily payments in 2008 with €11.3 billion 5% of health spending.
Under this amount fell 46% regarding maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on disease breaks, which is 6.2 billion euro.
And thus 2.5% of health care expenditure.
In 2010 were the French against the 17.8 days in 2009 according to a study of Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days allowed.
An average value which glossed over some differences: another, was published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning, site, revealed that 75% of the 40 000 stated surveyed, French workers, to have taken a single sick day.
An other, covered by health insurance, this time study makes it clear that 37% of sickness were in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
French workers tend no longer than elsewhere compared to their European neighbours to incapacity for work.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers of the French National Centre for scientific research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global rate of absences (disease or otherwise justified) reciprocated, at France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness represents a vanishingly small proportion with regard to undeclared work.
Here only a weak dimensions is achieved with regard to fraud.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 means that there are systmatische controls on sickness, exceeding 45 days.
"" In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) established under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of realised, short-term sickness, which were heiβt in 37.050 cases ", unjustified or too long".
The systematically controlled ill message cases more than 45 days, there were duration under 1.2 million 11% on "maladaptive or unjustified" cases, that is 132,000.
Overall, this makes so 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a notification.
A digit that represents only a weak dimensions compared to, for example, those of undeclared work.
According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a case report published in July with regard to this issue, between 9 and 15 billion Euro tax profit loss per year constitutes, i.e. more than the cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the Defraudation in the latter.
