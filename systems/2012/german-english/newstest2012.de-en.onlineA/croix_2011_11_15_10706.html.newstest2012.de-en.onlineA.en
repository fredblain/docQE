Moleskine, a brand book.
About fifteen years ago in life launched by an Italian company, Moleskine would like to give now new style writing.
It has an air of adventure, by candlelight with writing spent hours.
The notebook from Moleskine is easily recognizable with his black, rectangular cover, his rubber band, the eierschalfarbenen pages, as over time towards aged.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today originated however in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which has its headquarters in Milan, decided to take a distinguiertes design notebook on the market at the time.
Maria Sebregondi, at that time the expert advisor of the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook was from a traditional production technology, called mole (Mole skin) skin inspired, which refers to a Baumwollack, which is used, for example, for covers of upholstered benches.
This kind of notebook was very much in demand among writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has resurrected an old and almost forgotten item, which until the 20th century avant-garde artist was an icon", explains Maria Sebregondi, now Markenverantwortliche in modo modo.
The success occurs.
Increase sales by 26% between 2006 and 2010 and establish itself with a paragraph of 12.7 million.
This is far from the usual production of the first year where only 3,000 notebooks are designed.
Moleskine crossed the Italian border and runs in 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make an identikit of the buyer, since the notebook inspires as well as business people such as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open geistiger customers.
The small Italian company which had 12 employees in its infancy, employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookstores, on Internet portals such as FNAC, in small boutiques in the city centres and sees itself out to enforce his identity.
"We have followed the spirit of the times and his new Schreibbedarf, which despite the recovery of emails", said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched an exposition called "detour (detour)" in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno also brought a cover with Leopard print on the market.
Moleskine benefited from its success and this cultural zeitgeist and understood it to diversify its products: bags, schedule, filler, machine hull... The brand is in the whole range of articles.
A success, the envy brings to the plan: in the autumn of 2006 Modo Modo was purchased by the SG capital Europe, the current Syntegra capital investment fund, and set up so that a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
