What lacked del Valle of the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that is worked out that Melina Ramirez Serna not got the Crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14 missions title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went up empty in the granting of the Crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be satisfied that, to stand to make a silver Crown and the band, that indicates that it as new Miss Colombia, on the winners podium.
This night received resulting in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantico took the Crown and the Cedar itself, the Department already on 14 mission title comes and Melina joins the Legion of women from Valle del Cauca, which had kept the Crown almost in the hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Dominguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question facing many today, is: what was missing?
Because the result is the decline of a great favourite, which had shown that she had everything, to be the new Miss Colombia at every screening. Not for nothing she had been elected to the Queen of the police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles, who received also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and who took the Crown of Miss Colombia with home.
The first factor is as crucial for the decision of the jury, to appoint them, the first Miss is that they the answer to the question "What book you most strongly influenced and why?", which was been put by Martin Murillo Gomez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos, had not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca answered the honourable Member:
"I read a lot, I believe pretty much in the literature, I think, it's a way to civilize themselves, ultimately I think that the book that most influenced my childhood, ' Der kleine Prinz" is a very deep depth book. "
Currently, I read 'Crime and punishment'. It is a book of universal culture which we all should read. I read just a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is 'Passions'.
A response that met with little favour, firstly 'civilize themselves because of the term' and secondly, because it had not specifically stated how each book mentioned by her had influenced them.
But after the ceremony Melina explained to feel calm and happy with the result: "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done."
And for all the people: read please a bit ' the little Prince '. It is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that in advance all prices had gotten the fact that she was the preferred, which boasts all the Beifälle and the (gastronomy competition Oster, public vote on the best ink tailor-made costume and Reina Madre), "The other candidates jealous had made, what stresste the Queen could not therefore shining on stage."
And we realized that at its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly appeared on both, but the strength and the impetus which the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico were on display was her.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition, eventually but not Queen".
Also, Valle went to the end of the press out of the way - a mistake.
A further theory is that Valle could convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what ultimately is the essence of national beauty contest.
It will have his reason, that two days before the collection of the international jury of Lucy Doughty said they searched for a woman who is committed to the Social Affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone not sufficient for a Miss Colombia." "One must look beyond the physical and concentrate on the social feeling, sure that she had worked with before taking part in the competition on projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with its defects of the Derrière and the fibrosis, you noted it in the stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose it as candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits, and good physical work.
The coach of the Queens, Jorge Hernan Orozco, admits that Melina was not the best body that there is better, "but their problem with the fibrosis on the belly for me frankly hard to notice it was pushed their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos by the magazine of Cromos of view is, the surgical interference, where she had undergone had been the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca.
"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how she it right should be."
"Her body has never been their strong side, and she had to pay this point."
Due to this award, first awarded by the national beauty contest, a cruel prediction that should be true in the night was built after the appearance in a bathing suit. There was rumour that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they come in the the Crown to make.
No matter, whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is from today the year of her rule, although not as a Queen, but as a Princess, on appointment of national beauty contest of Colombia at one of the international competitions to represent a position that offers her the opportunity.
However, she will go down as one of the Queens, despite their overwhelming presence for Cartagena, the Crown had escaped in the history.
