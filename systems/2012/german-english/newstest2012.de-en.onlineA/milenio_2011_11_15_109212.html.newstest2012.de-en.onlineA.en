The designated Prime Minister, Mario Monti, tomorrow meets with the President of Italy, to present the new Government this, which is to confront the crisis, which has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A message from the Presidential Palace announced that the Monti on Sunday appointed would meet on Wednesday with the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm the formation of the Government.
It is assumed that he will present a Cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his post.
Monti said he would present the results of talks with political parties to form the President.
"I would like to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU Commissioner told the journalists.
Monti confirmed the formation of the Government not explicitly, but from his comments, it is clear that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "Framework is now well defined," he added.
Monti has managed in less than three days to form a Government, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of debt amounting to an unbearable.
The new Government led by the former Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package, which was required by the euro politicians to regain confidence-stopped in Italy.
The pressure to rush, which weighs on Monti, intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which the Italian Government bonds for 10 years with 7 percent interest were charged. This corresponds to the State, where Greece and Ireland are forced saw, to apply for the European recovery screen.
Emma Marcegaglia, President of Confindustria, the Italian industry grouping told the press after a meeting with Monti with: "We said we would support all efforts of this Government."
We believe that this Government is the last chance for Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti's were significantly enlarged by the support of the Party of PDL, Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti that are intended to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party, is essential because until now many of its members have opposed a majority consisting of technocrats Government, which just makes Monti.
Support of the Parliament
The new Government, from Monti requires a strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or slow down the reforms could again cause a devastating attack of the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks exercise with his note, Monti's failure a disaster, also pressure was off.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, unions and associations, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
Dienstagabend, the session round to be completed.
Monti was appointed by Napolitano this Sunday, has set an extremely fast change of Government in motion in response to the crisis.
After recently breathing towards the end of last week, it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as the cost of the Italian Government bonds have reached as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister again critical limits.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt in the amount of EUR 1.8 billion, would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said his Government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that the politicians only time to implement the reforms will give him, instead the options preferable.
Monti said, he would like to record politicians in his Cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in the light of the proceedings imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and the disagreements between the games make complicated the involvement of persons from political life.
