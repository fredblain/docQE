The annual general meeting is to find a new Chairman – again threatens a stalemate.
Almost five months of Czech football has no Chairman and thereby threatens that Ivan Hašek successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) not even will be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until today are according it the electoral code should be dialed: still no agreement.
And without this, at all, no vote on the three potential successors is possible.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek retired from his position, where he called on his colleagues at the departure to had to agree and to find a strong personality that could guide the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hasek the old quarrels between the two chambers of the Federation broke out again, which themselves cannot agree on a joint candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, when the new Chairman should be selected.
The delegates of the annual general meeting had come completely free in the Volkshaus in the Prague quarter Smichov, because negotiation led to no result, and was not only to the election itself.
One could indeed not even about agree, who is actually entitled to vote at the full collection - only the statutory representatives or officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, it reached at least some agreement, which contributed also the recommendation of the Institute of State and law, whose opinion a representation on a proxy basis is not permissible.
The disputes over the electoral code take to still.
The Executive Committee also brought no more clarity on the matter at its meetings – regardless of whether ordinary or extraordinary - in nothing else more on the agenda is the principle at all.
Although the views on the choice changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: what should we do round in the 3rd, to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether one should proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a completely different model needs to be found," Dušan Svoboda, said that one of the three Deputy Chairmen of FAČR representing the professional football management.
According to its registered model, those candidate who receives the larger percentage support in the Chamber for the Perben WINS in the third round.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that WINS those candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both houses.
The Czech side in turn is on the condition that the winner of this percentage counting receives at least two-thirds.
"Then the two preliminary rounds have no sense whatsoever, this mode would make the entire dual-Chamber concept into question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, that it would be best not to turn to the electoral code, but to choose according to valid Statute.
Surprisingly also Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if emerging that the statutory electoral code of all candidates will most probably Pelta contrary to.
"My wish is, that as far as possible is selected according to the articles of Association."
"So that no unreasonable spare variants are thought of as at the last annual general meeting", explained the owner (of football) Victoria Plzeň, who stood for the first time and in his opinions, especially Pelta to delimited himself.
Pelta remains but optimistic.
In his opinion the new Chairman will be in Nymburk known and he believes that the candidate in the future will also constructively work together.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the euro today would help ensure calm the minds."
"If the football only riding on the euphoric wave, then also the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, which brings the greatest experience of all three adepts and this professional, as well as regional level.
Rajchl is as restrained.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts"to turn their way the rules for his own purposes"."
"Therefore, a renewed blockage at the annual general meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope that the common sense WINS eventually", said Rajchl.
Only - plenty of time to agreement all sides will remain no longer.
Some negotiations should play is supposedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generality of football will be completely up to the qualifier at all.
The Charter plane which, among other things, Dalibor-Kučera and Rajchl should fly to Podgorice, could not start due to a technical malfunction in the morning in Prague and so it sought feverishly for a replacement version, how to bring a part of the Executive Committee yet on the venue of the barrage Hinspiels.
Finally the meeting at ministerial level is crucial then surely, which supposedly is to occur on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, which would have been Minister for education, youth and physical training like an agreement moves the divided parties within the largest Sportverbands in the country.
There is much at stake: State benefits, the trust value of Czech football, and also the upcoming AGM of ČSTV, that is to have the new direction the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into battle to the position of Chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
When Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner football players before the extraordinary general meeting could have made out a strong candidate, which would have fulfilled all of his wishes on the new Chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would have admitted is at all not on the battle for this leading position.
"If there were a good candidate, then I would for him fight and forego the choice."
"But in the current situation, was unable to find a such adepts", Paclík, CTK said.
The main reason for Paclík, to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is it so to avoid that which reaches supposed favorites of choice, Pelta, to the top of FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that he only one year to exercise the function of the Chairman intends in the event of his victory so until 2013, up to the date of the annual general meeting.
In the position of the Chairman he would have liked learn a top-manager, which is not too much in the football events.
"With some eligible people I've spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that me some said they wanted to identify currently not with Czech football."
"Such views would have gladly changed", he stated.
Most of all, Paclík allegedly disturbs the connection of Pelta's with the Chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association Roman jumpers, a man with a controversial reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegates votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is unacceptable that Pelta had held the position of Chairman for this reason.
"In his victory would the State of today's single konserviert and Czech football it not go ahead at all."
"The support of jumpers, one would get excellent businessman, football double bad", stressed Paclík.
Hereby he plays on also that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone taps to determine in a Korruptionsaffaire, but punishment emerged from the Pelta.
"I a victory of Pelta don't know (Czech) which prestige which" "Football should introduce."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA" řekl Paclík said his "he will sell the Pilsner Football Club earlier saying, when will Pelta of Chairman", but already somewhat relaxed looks.
Should Paclík in the Thursday election win, he could imagine but quite a future cooperation with Pelta.
Just think an another candidate - Rajchl, the Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."
"He has great ability".
"I could imagine him well as head of the national team."
"But I don't think that he is able to lead the Association as a Manager."
"I stick my nose but not in matters of which I don't understand anything", said Paclík, which thus had caused September stir, that he was behind the removal of the referee Commission with Luďěk Macela at the top, replacing the Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík even claims that he feels has grown the role of Verbandsvorsitzenden.
And refers it to his abilities in the direction of private companies, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, which with its support in May the first victory in the League celebrated.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, what degenerate until in sickening situations", noted Paclík who makes no secret of his antipathy for example opposite the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, he would see to the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, which he lobbyieren would the political leaders for this, that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"That is one of the crucial things the new President should address".
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must say but also quite and clearly where the money is going," he said.
His connection to the Pilsen Club looks at also Paclík not as a handicap, even though he himself stressed the Chairman of FAČR must be "nonpartisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl with the Dukla Prague.
"This is not exactly ideal."
"It but also doesn't make much sense, Club hypocritically on a third party to transfer my shares in the Pilsner to return after one and a half years my opinion", Paclík made it clear.
Pelta promised new rules of FAČR, which will exclude a stalemate.
Two days before the annual general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the Chairman of the Board, namely Miroslav Pelta, promised he will strongly become in case his choice for this, that the FAČR gets new statutes exclude disputes over the election rules from the outset in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk and believes the election will defuse safely on a possible success in the Czech selection.
Pelta promised already before the unrealised election in September, he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of financial resources in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last minute, to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two month pause liked help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present in a broader context.
"People at all levels focus on the football, they are impatient and expect therefore that the Chairman is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time, that the Association is led by someone, says the man who Club is connected above all with the Jablonec, but also many years at Sparta, and the Executive Committee acted."
Also, he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that the euphoria is responsible for today's problems with the election, who ruled at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately statutes were approved at the annual general meeting in June, which were not so perfect, as all had accepted it."
"If they would have allowed different interpretations, we would have had already a Chairman from September", said Pelta.
He used just the revision of the main document of the civic association as Attractants for the delegates.
"Should I become President, then I suppose this personally to me and am ready to bear responsibility if it doesn't work out personally."
"This is a fundamental thing, without which it can not be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to differentiate itself compared to his counterpart.
He had earlier announced he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, which he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first Deputy.
He no longer attacked also Tomáš Paclík, who in turn had no dry thread on Pelta.
"In football, he moves over a year and can already point to some success."
"His attacks were putting down however, and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"That is also why many of his real character doubt now", Pelta addressed his rival who probably remains true to his Proklamierungen, he expressed in September.
In his opinion his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football of the lowest leagues up to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would try also to end all affairs - from the causa Bohemians, up towards to the halls to of the corruption scandal last year."
"Equal then I would throw me on negotiations with the private and public sectors, to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole football", the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate CTK said two months ago.
At that time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would mean no personal cleansing.
"I would have to make me once familiar with the job content of all employees," he said where due to the long anarchy understandably nervousness prevails in the direction of Strahov.
Despite the UN time-catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming annual general meeting, he believes that the delegates go not in vain on Thursday to Nymburk.
"When really, the only contentious point should be how to choose in the third round, then we come across it."
"The football needs credibility and he recovers only, if he finally has a new leader," remains optimistic before the possibly decisive day of his official career Pelta two days.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below it starts to work hard
If the existing Deputy Chairman, Jindřich Rajchl, at the annual general meeting should be chosen on Thursday as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, this would despite the mood said many people in the Association.
Rajchl promises, namely, that you begin to work hard in the event of his election.
He wants to introduce the system changes and blaming the members of the Executive Committee for individual football areas.
In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money in football, and otherwise continue working the previous Chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As President I would like to dedicate me football as a whole."
"From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, about the national team, professional football, up to performance football for youth."
"So I will not say that I want to do everything alone", Rajchl said in a talk for CTK.
"I am a team player and would like to distribute therefore the responsibilities the Executive Committee so that each Member dedicates a certain area."
"And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in each segment with street steps of progress."
"In many would not exactly delighted because she, even now really hard to work would have to start instead of criticizing only the work of others,", he added.
Because the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, to no longer be a candidate.
"I is known that I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people behind me are not constantly throw me stick between your legs and challenge every step I make," he said why he had hesitated as an explanation.
"Many people told me but that I not should give up, because otherwise, others would do it."
"That's confidence that we must not lose," he said.
Allegedly motivated him also, to continue the work he started on Hasek.
"In two years, we have dealt with a great piece of work and I want to not just throw away that."
"Processes were launched, will probably only be implemented in a few years and I would hate to see that she stop someone", he said, and hereby expresses his concerns to, that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return themselves to the days before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that does not bring Mirek Pelta."
"Especially people who would make football so that he would be only for chosen as stand behind him."
"One can not accuse probably a lot me, that I would be biased."
"I try, to be objective."
"I want football for all, and not only the elect because it then goes all," noted Rajchl.
It contradicts also the assertion that he is only a Chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people the opposite claim I really intend to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether you should divide the League not in a Czech and Moravian part, whose Gewinner then rose to the first division."
"Then it could not happen, that today only three Moravian clubs in the League play, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia", says Rajchl.
Because now the boss of the Pilsen Club Tomáš Paclík joined the battle for the function of the Chairman, Rajchl not dares to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to its Deputy President and now recognizes that measurable results behind me are," noted Rajchl who sees the saving of umpteen million crowns to unfavourable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and negotiations over the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand he is holding it that the Association not at a single strand draws in part.
While he of Pelta says "he was initially disqualified new confidence to help Czech football," he keeps the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate who have to offer something really to football.
"No one can be in question, he has done excellent work in just one year in Plzen."
"Should he be elected, then he would continue probably things, initiated by Ivan Hašek and he would obviously not basically change the staffing in the commissions."
"He would want to turn to the things not to abdicate", Rajchl says about his rival.
