Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were ČSSR only five authorized State agencies in the former: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies sold mainly only travel in the Socialist bloc countries, were at that time only select in the West.
And so travelled Czech tourists on the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic - East Germany), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and after Hungary at the Lake Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to the former Yugoslavia, then, Yugoslavia set a pro-Western course and therefore trips were limited to the former Yugoslavia.
A great paradox of those Socialist times was that it was not even allowed citizens of the Eastern bloc (including the Czechs), to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of CZECHOSLOVAKIA wanted travel for example individually to Poland or even in the Soviet Union then he needed to a so-called letter of invitation, otherwise individuals were not possible.
Already at that time, the travel agencies offered also travel to the West, then had to you but huge snakes in buying take stay also in the sleeping bag before the travel agency, or have at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
So the thing had not been still long.
The so-called foreign exchange approval - the condition for a departure to the West - has been granted only "politically reliable" people – the others were allowed to travel do not.
The Czechoslovak currency was namely not freely exchangeable currency, without foreign currency commitment it would have been impossible, to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a journey to the West.
The Afar most Czechs spent therefore their holidays at home, no wonder that the Czechs countless pavilions and cottages bought - a habit that continues to this day.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the Velvet Revolution of 1989 on the foot.
While until 1989, a holiday in East Germany or in Bulgaria were the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries of around the world last year.
An enormous paradox, there is today no longer aware, is the fact that you ever not could travel Croatia in the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of 90's of the last century the foreign exchange requirement in the neighbouring West European countries was lifted, causing a massive wave of short visits to Vienna, in particular Austria and Germany.
The Czechs could have simply not enough long time of their travels to the West, everyone wanted to have been at least a couple of days there.
So, the Czech tourists when travelling to Paris slept in a tent in the Park, because who would have had at that time already the money for a stay in the hotel or in a boarding house.
A typical feature of travelling by Czechs was a trunk packed full with canned food, beer and summer sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of freely exchangeable CZK - after decades of our tourists could buy finally free the Western currency.
Our standard of living and thereby also the average salaries increased to, which in 1997 resulted in a more important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel after 1997, the travel agencies began regularly by Charter flights to prepare journeys, which incredibly prices plunged the airline travel thanks to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past.
The Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment transactions with all advanced countries of the world, had the late of 1990s which made the trip even easier.
A further interesting moment in the history of "post Velvet" travel occurred in 2000, when thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country - was placed under Thailand.
Since then every year direct Charter aircraft fly with Czech passengers to distant sunny countries; This year, it flies to 12 exotic destinations directly from the Czech Republic.
To the 100 thousand. Czech travel annually to exotic countries!
A further significant moment in the era that featured our "post-revolutionary" development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the visa requirements for Czech tourists picked up the United States, which our country definitely filed a under the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent for the first time more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history it issued more than 15 thousand. CZK per head for a single stay including the costs at the resort.
