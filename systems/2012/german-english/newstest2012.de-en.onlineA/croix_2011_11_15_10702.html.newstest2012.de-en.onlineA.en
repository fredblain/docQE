Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The gas pipeline Nord Stream that runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and Western Europe connects directly with Russia, was put into operation.
She will provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and circumstance.
About 500 invited guests, including four heads of State and Government, stream have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic Sea coast under the orchestral sound reinforcement and gourmet buffet of the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord, which directly connects Russia and Germany under the sea level.
German Chancellor Angelica Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart have mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise together behind the wheel of the valve upside down, which promoted the Russian gas into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year should be delivered by a first pipeline 1.224 km long, connecting the region St. Petersburg with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, to Western Europe.
A second pipeline that allows a total delivery of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - to be completed end of 2012.
And you can already sound to the eventuality of the construction of a third pipe on your own route.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will a direct gas allow namely after Germany, and by avoiding any Trassenverlaufs by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the land.
For this reason, these two countries lose their power a little: for them, it is now harder to exert pressure on Russia by them threaten to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, was spared back not afraid to compare the "Nord Stream" pipeline with a "new German Soviet Pact" in connection to the Alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject of politically äuβerst is sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a greater security of supply through the assertion of this Russian project.
This is however at the expense of an exposure of European energy, because the project has taken a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia it done brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct Alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong Gasverbrauche and whose gas reserves running out, go to enforce.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the opening of the gas pipeline by he pointed out to what extent the vast gas contracts also from political and economic side are important.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous represented in Lubmin Gazprom Manager with regard to the gas line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater cable is made of steel with concrete coating to protect them from ship anchors.
You resting on the ocean floor about 200 metres in depth.
In its construction had to be dodged war FP4 minefields.
"About hundreds of mines had to just in case be removed or destroyed", stated Jens Müller, spokesman of the company Nord Stream.
There had to be taken enhanced measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The line is a long line of metal, hard as 242 Eiffel, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves, even maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project took distance from, since the Sweden little on it were eager to see in a permanent way to level its coastline settle a Russian State company.
"In the event of an accident we close the gas flow in less than a minute", explained Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak that escapes itself in the gas pipeline owned gas so into the air.
This case is considered but probably by design engineers little, because the Schweiβnähte was estimated to be a resistance of a leak per 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of gas transmission is both guaranteed by an underwater robot, which controlled for external observation purposes of a seagoing ship out is as also from a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, miβt a meter in diameter, is introduced into the Interior of the pipe and moving through the gas pressure.
After three full days of locomotion through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device on his arrival provides most accurate details of the possible deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline is designed for fifty years to work, without even the slightest repair must be subjected to.
Quite simply, the gas circulation is ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry, 100 bar at the exit site.
Five companies have combined their forces to the realisation of this project.
However, the wiring remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Still, the German companies of E. ON and BASF are affiliated (according to 15.5%), here as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company GDF Suez (according to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community, called Nord Stream and which is entrusted with the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It has its registered office in Zug in the Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has rented then the entire capacity of its gas transport company, on twenty-year renewable contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the capacity, no matter how much the real transport fails volume of gas", explained Jens Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline was secured 30% of shareholders, as well as to 70% by bank loans.
The total labour cost should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez the investment was for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are however gewiβ to recoup their expenses, because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The gas pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastline at Lubmin Baltic revealed.
The 4.5-meter valves form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature, and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded in the German gas pipeline.
Since last Tuesday, this Terminal with a million m3 of Russian gas passes hour is supplied.
At full capacity, 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012 would be this.
