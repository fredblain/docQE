The world gemäβ of the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in oversimplification and ignorance with regard to China's, the Iraq, and the support for Israel.
A crisis geschwächtes America can a complex world with simple, not to say: simplistic ideas lead?
So listening to the Republican presidential candidate, voters could get nearly this impression.
Since a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, have repeatedly disclose their thundering declarations, as well as their statements regarding the foreign, traditional republikanischem focus, Rick Perry and their supporters.
On China, the Iran and the Israel help falling - often in no way based - slogans.
He most highly threatened with regard to the appointment of the "grand old party" in due course Mitt Romney to cite the Chinese to the WTO and to accuse them of "currency manipulation" leading topic in an America that through the migration of entire industries to Asia on the utmost is irritated-.
Stupid run, if this should imply initiate a trade, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador to China under Obama and sole candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign, has lined the air is almost in terms of his attitudes schmeichelnden the emotions.
He had called for a solid, but constructive conversation Exchange with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama's).
But Huntsman is not heard because he is stagnating in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had praised also military strikes against the Iran, if the sanctions to the Stoppung of Nuklearprogrammes should fail.
"If I am elected, I command put an end the Iran", he had tinted.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb".
Also has he promised increased military aid Israel and Obama accused still guilty this partners against commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, second placed candidate, in turn carries a shameful ignorance of the file display.
Recently he urged, "try to develop" a nuclear power - and seemed except eight while the fact the Chinese military threat to give, since Beijing against admitting that China is already since 1964 in the possession of military nuclear weapons!
In turn, the Texas Governor Rick Perry, which supports Israel and calls for military strikes against the Iran, about to be ready to take the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The 2009 prohibited by Obama use of Foltermaβnahmen compared to mutmaβlichen terrorists was also advocated by Cain, Perry, as well as the Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an auβenpolitischen heavyweight.
The current presidential rivals, Reagan have also simple ideas had and still won the cold war.
Call in mind that also Obama selbstein amateur and had to pay water in his wine, what concerned the subject of anti-terrorism.
You rightly insist on the failure of his naive discourse with the Iran, of the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from the Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This Anfeindung is however not quite as casual.
The population estimates rather the positive balance of national security under Obama that bin Laden has turned off.
Since the Iraq, it guards against military interventions that lead to the clog.
And Obama surprisingly adequate, by he argues, America should economically be rebuilt to bring its leadership to new life.
