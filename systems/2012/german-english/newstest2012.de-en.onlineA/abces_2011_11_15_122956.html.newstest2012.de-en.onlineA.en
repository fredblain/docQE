Athens casts again doubt
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be adopted, but the Conservatives will sign a written agreement
With the risk premiums driven in the height of the peripheral countries and be broadly continued uncertainty, Greece continue lost in the labyrinth that creators of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek Government is a response to pressure from Brussels rather than a genuine belief of political forces, is slowly consumed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday, that there is no alternative to the reforms and that the hundred days agreed to his appointment were perhaps too short for their implementation, the leader assured Nueva Democracia, Antonis of Samaras, that he support the new austerity measures and by no means its call new elections to the conservative party intended date, 19 February, will take back.
Papadimos assured "The most important task of this Government is implementing the decisions taken at the Summit of 26 October," yesterday to open a parliamentary debate that will reach its climax tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new Government.
The first initiatives are a package of 24 programs to boost employment, the reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion.
Nevertheless Samaras communication gives insufficient doubts about his attitude: "we have to support the Transitional Government promise, but otherwise nothing."
The Conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge of the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8000 million, which badly needs Athens. He made it clear that he would approve no commitment on compliance with the cost-cutting measures.
But the European Commission, that referendum is still irritated because of the effects of poker play with Papandreu, reaffirmed yesterday again, their request was not to shake: the economic aid would not be signed, if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "a clear written agreement as soon as possible" would sign.
The spokesman of the Ministry of economy, Amadeu is, explained that the inspectors of the troika "very soon" come back to Athens, to discuss "what for the payment of the sixth section" needed was"of 8000 million euro" Although there is still no final date with the new Government.
The Greek skein has threads for a while.
