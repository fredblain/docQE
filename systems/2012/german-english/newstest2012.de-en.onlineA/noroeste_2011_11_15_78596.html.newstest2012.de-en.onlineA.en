"What we are seeing now is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors." "With loss of liquidity on the market as a result of the reductions of appropriations by the legislation adopted to combat money-laundering in Congress because, for those who illegally amass dollars, among other things, it is not easy, these work for themselves to make, invest, or use for something else," he said.

"These people stay here and here looking for work, allowing unemployment to rise," he says.
Undeclared work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious, bearing in mind the high proportion of undeclared work. This includes according to INEGI 60,38 per cent of the country people who have work, without having to pay into the social security coffers.
