Consideration is given to the possibility to count the ballots in Michoacán individually
According to PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the election of the Governor is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total 6074 still not have been counted out.
The possibility of the single count of the ballot is a reality in this year election in Michoacan, because according to the data issued by the Programa de resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total 6074 still not have been counted out.
In this sense, has the President of the Consejo General del Instituto electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Maria de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just once on 9 November last the polling place had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise the local rules with the reforms of the caucus States.
We must remember that Michoacán had adapted its political Constitution nor its electoral law, nor his law on the electoral justice to the reforms adopted by the Congress, so that they came not in force when this round of voting. The Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the Official Gazette within the time limits provided for this purpose with the argument to have still objections.
On 9 November the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) decided on by the local legislative submitted constitutional claim and the voice of the State representative to the constitutional reforms judged as "illegal and unlawful", because it has not the right about "choose or to insert a veto against it".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained during an interview about the possibility of the single count of votes, that thanks to the adoption of the directives by the Consejo General del IEM now the option would be, that the local election administration partly or wholly could count the ballots.
So the voices contained in one or more option packages can be counted under the following conditions partly the results in the logs do not match; the Protocol on the counting of votes and-berechnung is not available aktenmäßig, there are obvious errors or amendments in the logs, or it is not owned by the Chairman of the Electoral Commission.
Also, the total counting of the completely filled out ballots can occur when there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one who is in second place, is equal to or less than one percent, provided at the start of the session an explicit request of the party or coalition Chairman before, which is the second of the above candidates.
Counting can be done in its entirety, if after the ordinary calculation determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, assuming it is available an express request by a representative of the party, whose Kandidat has become second. In this case, the choice of packages would be a partial count suspended, excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections are in Morelia in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between the first and second place is just 0.16 percent, although the voices of 129 total 923 option logs still not have been counted out.
