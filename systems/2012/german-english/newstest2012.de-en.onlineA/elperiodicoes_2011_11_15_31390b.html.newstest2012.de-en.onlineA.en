Park or mountain?
The architects are apart from the disputes about fees with the tender agree.
The urban call for proposals of the 16 goals opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again.
Mid-1980s, at the height of the now vanished Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration published its libel on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was compared even to numbers with Central Park of New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987 in the eyes of many was again to the ceiling of Barcelona, as the capital of Catalonia is one (mountain range) and down the few who is spreading in North South direction but upwards (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
As an example, the Central Park, but Yellowstone no longer served with feral pigs in the role of want bärs.
It was as far as the city spent a huge tender, consisting of 16 contests for more access gates to Collserola in September.
No doubt a goal refers to the concept of a park.
Is it so or someone intends to ask gates to the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is the topic of conversation in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona not only from organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city.
It's almost a rekurrentes theme, two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can access the back.
And exactly this fact provides the fabric for one of the rare matches between the three architects from Barcelona about thinking, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldan "it is necessary" to speak, after the attack on the coast of the "front of the mountains" as far as the discourse by Ildefons Cerdà, who about the Green apples, not held has been.
"It should be the principle, that Barcelona's biggest Park is the beach."
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
"Collserola is complex," says the architect, for the title of "Gates of Collserola" carries a "lexical trap" in itself: man should they not "as access to a park imagine, rather than containment of areas on which we must act."
Modol, such as Roldan and Bayona with urban experience, considered an "intellectual challenge" that is "some hazards" in the proposal.
Driven as a result of the "insecurity, which nowadays entails the design of public space" after the experience of the 1980s, which had her "Swan Song" in the section of the Forum.
The first fear is their own limit on what can be built on.
"Something to restrict means always, to set the next step", i.e. to him exceed.
"We must consider new urban planning instruments, because the present [referring to the plan of General Metropolitano (PGM)] may lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is close to the question thinks the page of Collserola, which goes in the direction of Vallesana, simplified, "can in direction Barcelona not a park be understood as," for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there already are a study of the patronage de Collserola, not "should launch on deaf ears", although he was grateful to the City Council that she gave the possibility of his body, on this project "from the first moment" to participate.
In addition, he noted that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the document that allows the architects to take part in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt", whether this technical profile the multidisciplinary teams launched ("just right", he says) should guide "We should be just a tool architects."
Bayona seems to indicate that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacking: "It 16 contests in cross-section were advertised", he says, "on the axis of mountain sea." "But there are no longitudinal perspective that considers the territory in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case that he participates in the 16 contests.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a goal with the architect of the gate in addition would collide.
His opinion the city should guarantee absolutely that the Strip directly over the Ronda de Dalt is equipped in its entire length, which creates a soft transition between city and green areas.
