Why is the unemployment rate handicapped person at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the "15th week of work for people with disabilities".
Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate of persons with disabilities is always twice as high as the average mean value: 19% against 9% unemployment of the population as a whole.
Disheartening?
"No, so Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Association adapt that aligns the"week of work for people with disabilities"stressed."
"The progress achieved fifteen years are substantial."
"At that time the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless enormously much remains to do."

Have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no high school diploma, and there are only 10,000 people with disabilities among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% in the total section.
In short, there are so many criteria which make a renewed work quickly, and which "Form the core of the problem", Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, is an association founded in 1992, the company help, hampered the to recruit workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains unspoken, the attitudes which although of course, but still slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS Entreprendre Association for the magazine La Cité stated, the managers surveyed have "a weak level knowledge with regard to people with disabilities", which is "over-represented" "of persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually Minderbemittelten".
Result is that private companies have still a long way to go with more than 20 employees in order to achieve the employment target of 6% handicapped workers, which was enshrined in a law of 1987.
These latter, directed 2008 figures refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now at around 3%" reported to collect contributions from companies Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organization that is responsible, which flout this law.

"The Act of 2005, which provides for contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, declared Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement also expresses a genuine knowledge particularly in the large groups."
According to the Ministry of labour, deal with only 59% of the premises between 20 and 49 employees disabled people in work, companies with 100 to 199 employees, however, 82%.
