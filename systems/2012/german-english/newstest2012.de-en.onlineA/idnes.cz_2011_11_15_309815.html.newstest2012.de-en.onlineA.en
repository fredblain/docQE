Professionals claim – a stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists, I had bitching a bit that was a bit too much stuff for the beginning.
Since I felt what still is not at all.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar about how that works "on the square".
It will be even worse.
Depending on the test moves closer, more information and practical tasks us ahead.
But even if the course Saturday and Sunday takes place each, he is still full.
This time we debated how it attracts a woman, who has not a perfectly proportioned figure with Director Alena (no one man takes part in the course).
And most of us are all the same.
Some have a short neck, the other a to boyish figure without proper curves, and still others are chubby.
It is visually to disguise thing of stylists, wide shoulders, to extend the neck, or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We got also tips on how you so cute and figurbetont attracts the type of a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with large breasts, wide hips and narrow waist, without that it acts too provocatively.
If for example, the difference between the waist and hips is so large that the skirt or pants really doesn't fit, should be made-to-measure tailor themselves at least a piece.
You will not regret it safely, because well fitting clothes is simply priceless.
In such a tailored skirt you'll feel much better than in a out of the box, all the time high and slide, standing off in the waist, etc.
In turn, boyish figures can allow to wear with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery, or gathering.
For this information and figure types, I am glad that a whole week I time, thoroughly through your head all me to let go.
And still, I am afraid that it is almost not to create given the on homework.
Each of the participants got assigned to a celebrity namely, for which it matching outfits should - think from day wear and evening gown.
We should consider the current look, the fashion style of the corresponding star and whose character type.
I want to Miranda Kerr "attract" might know Victoria's secret from the campaign.
Inside I Exult, because for me personally, this is much better than to attract such as Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which has increased probably to the hundred pounds in recent times (okay, that's a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The garments should we from magazines cut or search in the Internet, print and then graphically edit.
Is in the "mood Board", as the entire result is called, our personal style and our relationship to be then graphic design to express.
It is indeed very important to reflect also on the graphical side of stylings.
The stylist attracts models namely not only purely physically, but designed the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, such as the trend handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday lecture filled with details of figure types was flavored three visitors from the industry:
by the stylists Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and this should be capable of a stylist, to exploit this.
And a skilled stylist can do with a single article in a very different way to work.
The magic word is variability.
So you can wear as usual for example a trench coat over jeans, so like a shirt or coat, you can wear it but also on the naked body, to attract sales shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and just the whole look looks very different.
He stressed "Plays it,".
Most came but I located the following Council: "First you must know perfectly the rules."
"Only then you may break it, Jakub said.
Finally is me why we need to bone up on all these dogmas, what can be combined with which clear and why, even if you will see often quite different in Modejournalen.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing options, as he eventually photographed.
So you must be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (say ten outfits) it to style at least fifteen.
And also, that the clothing in the photo in combination with further accessories sometimes look very different from, as in reality.
So, with all this, you can expect in the design of the outfit.
That image and style sometimes half of the success of make up, this was confirmed by us also Jan Pokorný.
Since you need Madonna only once, to see a not just a brilliant singer, from the image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic it is facing the services of stylists rather reserved.
Also notable people deem it frequently throwing out money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look it is secondary).
And if somebody of us style, then we should expect that he or she imposes a different (smaller) size us most likely, than he or she needs in fact.
Then you then just have to Google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes the corresponding celebrity have to again or taken off, needs, etc.
Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday to the heart, not to believe that a stylist on fashion to focus and then "to assemble the outfit" need.
In his work he must communicate primarily with the people which he styles and he must be a clever psychologist.
People estimate, without to delivering to and stand to his opinion.
"If any Manager ordered us to sift through their wardrobe and to supplement beautiful pieces, then we can eliminate it not the whole closet and say - my God, this is so terrible."
"You need to find at least a few commendable things, which it recommends what you can wear", says Mario.
He showed us also concretely what must include as a so-called "space bag".
So a bag you to buttons at the waist and where to wear all required Proprietäten to himself.
Except such clear things, like scissors, dispenser to the hair removal or safety pins it contains also such utensils such as a nylon thread (so that the stylist for photographing of products such as handbags or hats helps out), special clips which back the clothes is killed, if it is too large (pins or other terminals are prohibited, so that the fabric is not broken) and of course sewing kit.
So that we must not only listen to, but also practically can try something, we learned how to properly under sticks shoes.
Also when shooting in the Studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let the outside.
Us o stuck and we stuck...
With scissors, you may not even touch the shoes for you Yes not damaged.
So, you must proceed really sent.
Mario delighted me by he praised my "creation" without any restrictions.
The mentioned skills is namely not just my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we at got to listen to the second weekend continuation rate.
One has become now clear to me - is the styling on a professional level to dedicate a no brainer.
