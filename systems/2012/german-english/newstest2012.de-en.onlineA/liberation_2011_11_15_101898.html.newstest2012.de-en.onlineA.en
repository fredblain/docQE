Energy policy:
Facts should defeat the dogmas
A theme that not on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions cannot be treated there certainly is energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises in direct measurements.
It is reasonable to take a selection meeting to the events, to reflect on this issue, as well as on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if she probed the entire of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should their opinions on objective facts, provide rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet are located, the demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, not an enormous proportion of the world's population must waive a vital element.
At the same time, you must alleviate the shortage of fossil resources continue constantly to produce electricity without the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a subject of disappearance from the environmental debate, forgetting to combat climatic border irregularities.
The accident of Fukushima changed none of this parameter.
Therefore blives Germany still in its decision isolated, to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which submits its decision the need to find a substitution-aware replacement source in the Switzerland just intended to build only nuclear power stations of the last generation.
UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few States, however, continue to monitor their projects with determination.
The United States decided in turn to Fukushima, to integrate to a further unit their Park, by the plant closed after the nuclear accident again taking three mile Iceland in operation.
Although geared towards renewable sources of energy, German model is occasionally presented as a role model, so the reality contradicts the discourse however.
The choice in Berlin will be in the form of an increase of the price of electricity, an energetic dependence reinforced by the increased use of imported gas in particular Russia, an increase of gas and coal-fired plants caused CO2 emissions put down.
All these unpleasant effects will manifest itself already within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives rise to thinking.
Denmark is on the one hand European League leaders with regard to wind energy, from which it applies 30% of its electricity, on the other hand the country of one of the largest user of coal and gas is alternately used with wind energy; aufgrunddessen are its CO2 emissions, as well as its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the resistance of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a higher in contrast to our French households by 40% electricity bill.
Because the price of energy in the globalised economy represents a key role in the competitiveness, as well as a pledge of stability the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe have an advantage.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would entail therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, what would become the noble statements about the Reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of the purchasing power of illusion.
Surveys showed that that was a price, the vast majority of French people is willing to pay as little, as opposition to the principle of this energy source they suggests.
We remember that the energy policy of our country has allowed to establish an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to their strong export nature brings you a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on international markets, making these creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to abandon nuclear power, the a majority of these SMEs victim would fall, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital and nuclear export would shrink together more and more.
What electricians would instruct an EPR designed to work on sixty years if the decline of his producers is inevitable?
To solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is a magic bullet for the generation of electricity work of the nor one like a devil.
Developed by the company Areva, -carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy bear witness to the complementarity of energy sources.
An absolute imperative is to maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority carried out by uncompromising and transparent controls in existing works such as in the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams that have made a name for itself due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security presentation.
50 Years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single one in three mile Iceland, under normal operating conditions occurred; so he proceeded without consequences for man and the environment.
Chernobyl, the drama has been invoked by reactor construction, as well as unendschuldbares, human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two unprecedented disasters which caused the death of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will pull their lessons as well from this accident, as she had done after the two previous.
As the fruit of this approach, as well as a cooperation between of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a design which allows him resistance to such phenomena.
Because under the contractors as desirable, considers it to build a nuclear power plant, a construction in Flamanville would a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, by it could be them free reign, to seize the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power in itself.
It is inevitable and legitimate to search for the best arrangement of energy for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate a debate emotions, dogmas and Parteiman√∂ber, determines the as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country.
