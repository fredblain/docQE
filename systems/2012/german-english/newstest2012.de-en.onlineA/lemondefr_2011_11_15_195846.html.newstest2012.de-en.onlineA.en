The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of General voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, the November 14 in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real difficulty.)
The future of Europe was originally not in the program, but has prevailed in the autumn, to provide enough especially to those activists who today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax appreciate the Government policy with regard to the Greeks.
The presidential resolution proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
However, only nine had voted among 1001 delegates, ten had abstain.
The several minutes lasting standing ovation that initially, Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble were as a result of their intervention orders, trial on the part of the three Europe inclined to Finance Minister no doubt open.
The main idea of the Chancellor has - as well as the request - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "Nine million jobs directly from the euro are dependent on".
The Chancellor is "the time for a breakthrough in Europe come for".
This could be expressed by a modification of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro area, bestärkende the control of the European Union; ""as this could result but in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of General voting", to give Europe a face".
However, this is definitely one of the application proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble stood Godfather.
Surely, it is hardly likely that the 47 agree quickly on this revolution: Groβ Britain is opposed faces the thing, and the Chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion.
The milestone is however.
As well, the delegates in an overwhelming majority have rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country on the ECB Executive Board according to the weight of the individual economies which obviously would be a strengthening of the position of Germany.
The Chancellor roofed to calm the climate within their party has reinforced thus the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She no longer tried their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the difficulties all European countries to win, which would immediately condemn the arrogant Germany.
As far as the Europe application dedicated to a paragraph of the significance of "German French friendship", Angela gets Merkel France not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig faced two centuries at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact one of the extremely humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
