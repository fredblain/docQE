Registration of a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution
Which is in Austria in power owned the large social-democratic/Christian-Democratic Coalition Government on Tuesday decided to record a "Golden budget rule" in the Constitution, to reduce public deficits and to avoid even a possible degradation on the part of credit rating agencies in the top credit rating (AAA) Austria.
The social democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann was highly personal, who announced this decision of the output of the Council of Ministers had, even though the public Austrian government debt at 74.6% is, so far above that the Maastricht Treaty criterion laid down by 60%, significantly below the level of debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"Would be dropped the solvency of Austria not in one fell swoop from AAA to AA +, so we would have to pay each year in addition three billion interest", Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat had argued.
Austria are also a requirement of the Brussels Summit of the Member States of the euro area on 26 October instead of: the heads of State and Government had at that time required until at the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public Kontengleichgewicht in the Constitution or through an equivalent law including the reduction of public deficits.
The action taken by the Austrian Government is similar to the "German model", because Germany had been the first European country that had taken such a "rule" in the Constitution.
By the year 2017 should be the structural budget deficit every year by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) lower, commencing in 2017 the State's structural budget deficit should not exceed 0, 35% level of GDP, whereas the regional States as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
It aims, in the horizon of 2020 / 21 the budget debt below the 60% laid down by the Maastricht Agreement criterion to eradicate.
