The Secretary Dionisio Perez Jacome announces details of the aircraft accident, in which the Government Secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people were killed.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat of communications and transportation in Mexico) informed that the findings of the accident in which were the Government Secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people killed, pointing out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly against the ground is bounced without that the pilot would have to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Perez Jacome, Secretary of communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot before the start would have confirmed, the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"The fact that contact with trees had the propeller blades 25 M above sea level, where the helicopter lost the body, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter for 19 passengers was built which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the field, on which the machine was run down.
"Find no aircraft parts at other locations were found, the surcharge covered the entire structure."
The helicopter was built for 19 passengers, which is why he fulfilled all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area is in a skew from 7 to 30 degrees.
Currently it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year.
In turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Managing Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretary for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that was flown in the helicopter by the Estado Mayor Presidencial at impact with cruising speed and the aircraft on a soft slope fallen.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was at the time of impact a normal flight operation."
At a press conference the Director listed the SCT, Perez Jacome, six relevant points should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual:
In accordance with the standards of the flight there was a flight according to the rules of Sichtflugs. This means that the crew would have had sufficient view in-flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The JUÁREZ recorded appropriate weather conditions at the start. During the Weiterflugs in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, some deep hanging clouds moved on.
Selected routes:
It is possible that the team due to the clouds had selected a lower area with a better view in the direction of the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
Match the impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter. May be it has before impact neither a loss of control of the aircraft still a deviation from the flight path given.
Dispersal of the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicate that the helicopter from the straight and lateral direction was bounced.
The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft indicate that the helicopter was bounced with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
Offer the remains of the aircraft at the accident site indicate neither fire nor explosion.
The recent findings point to several ground contacts.
Investigations on the ground, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is gentle and has a skew of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence where the helicopter is probably gone to break.
Some information indicate that the helicopter could have had several ground contacts.
After a minute search on an area that went beyond the fenced-off area at the accident site, no scattered parts of the aircraft could be found, what the adoption of strengthened, that the intact aircraft structure against the ground was bounced.
