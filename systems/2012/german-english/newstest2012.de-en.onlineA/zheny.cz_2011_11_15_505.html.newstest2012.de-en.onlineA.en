The worst female Untugenden: What is's with you?
If one asks the men to to call some typical female Untugenden, then they shake some invariably prompt from the sleeve.
Dear women, recognize you are in the following lines, where we review a few were let through again, that the blood in the veins undulate allow men?
Shopping addiction
Accuses her husband them to be addicted to shopping?
Need to buy yourself a week at least a Hader?
Go like shopping and it may be just a bit more action?
It is in your case probably really a weakness.
Some women are at least aware and reasonably try their shopping desire under control to keep.
But hand on heart, which woman holding out there already, looking to stroll after a well-fitting outerwear only by a clothing store and not just to try out all (in all possible colour combinations) in the cabin?
Even when shopping for most women is a hobby, for men it is pure hell often.
Consider how often they said her husband doch mal - stay times rather out there...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too thick?"
'I would have to diminish at least five kilo, should I start to jog or to make gymnastics?'
"You at all like I?"
It is found that somehow known them?
Yes?
Then you probably also belong to the women who are thorough owned them, what they look like.
That long does not mean that you go to can, but many men are allergic react if their wife constantly whines about her appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are always more.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Window cleaning, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and this at least twice in the week.
Rant with her partner, because he once again trampling with dirty shoes on the clean floor tiles, you scold the children because the just frayed sink is dirty again, and the glass door to the living room Cabinet again has fingerprints, where polishing but makes so much effort?
Should suffer this kind of "Deviance", then you should know that you may exaggerate nothing and that order and cleanliness in family life in the first place.
This excessive purity alternatively can harm ultimately also the mutual relations and above all tranquility in the family.
Jive
"Dirty collarless come in the laundry basket."
"Do you attract really tomorrow again the old socks?"
"You cannot simply throws a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a rant, you may not be surprised, that this brings him on the Palm.
Clearly, this is not bad meant, they just want that everything has its order.
If the men knew this women needed may be not so much to gripe.
Gossip
Some women gossip and gossip like, as is getuschelt behind the back or even slander or it forges alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, therefore it heck through such issues like for example - who, where, who, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip on Commons.
Hand on heart - that is inherent to all women.
This is however not to be confused with Klatschtanten of grossest caliber, where nothing and no one is holy, which probably despise anyone in their environment, and which pose a significant risk for women collectives.
