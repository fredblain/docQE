Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous starts Peter Englunds's new book "Beauty and terror." "Tells a story of World War I, in nineteen fates" with a long list of characters which one goes to heart.
Here's a tip, what you could do: simply cutting out this page carefully and make them to your bookmarks.
You will learn about these people in Englunds romanhafter story very well. And these principals will work as your GPS as a lighthouse in those few moments where you lost men and women in the fog of war such as Englunds and your illusions are deprived.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an extraordinary book that he describes as "a work of anti-history" not poorly.
It contains just a few big names, major contracts or famous battles. There is little Ambassador, rabid reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he said but rather "a book about it, as it was". It is of "Emotions, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war together, schoolgirl and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose a limb, be crazy, or die.
Each of these life flickers as the Votivkerzen in a church, some come, while others go out.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the first world war was only the devastating atmosphere on the Western front.
"Beauty and terror" moves with expert views on other battlefields: the Alps, the Balkans, the eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Fall beehives on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
Almost from the outset, this is a moving book.
The war flooded the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, like a Hurricane Katrina, which smells of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children, and cannon fire heard in the distance. Stay or take flight?
Whoever comes at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happens or why this war ever occurs.
"Missing facts", Englund notes "were with guesses, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors revamped."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, a British nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were collected mainly memories, letters and other already published material.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are very alive in Englunds of losing details collection of small moments.
Many of them deal with shortages and to manage.
In the history of a German Schulm√§dchens, telling: "replacement, anywhere replacement."
"Coffee substitute, fake aluminium, false Eraser, paper associations, buttons."
He tells more of the spare supper in Germany.
He describes "meat, was made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and most recently was served with a wrong bones made of wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato peelings, shoes that were besohlt with wood."
There was, as he recorded "837 registered food substitutes who were allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered substitutes."
Some stories deal with honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to the savagery and says about the war: "One feels that is that despite everything, what more was intended for men to sit with the Abendblatt bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in his hand, as in an armchair, and to do so, when such a facade mean civilization, and as if there were no barbarism behind the own stronger and MISTED Shirtfront."
Conversely, a British soldier recognizes that he will probably die and nobody of note taking or worry about.
"If you take distance from thought, to sacrifice themselves, one would like to think that this is done before an audience", he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations be of old Europe, which falls apart, and new types of terror.
"The conflict was increasingly becoming an economic competition," Englund writes "a war between the factories."
He begins a the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still-young century": "The word applied and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit, which slaughters, while behind a desk sitting."
People behave in unexpected ways, and there are also frivolous behavior such as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers actively trying to infect himself with a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease to escape the Frontdienst.
"The grotesque expression can be detected in the trade of gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and is smeared on their genitals to come in the hope, as in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rubbing it in the eye, what caused that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter graves, Englunds poetry is supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts itself perfectly to his human duty.
In dozens of small scenes he captures a way, like war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why they bring their leaders to fight.
The best books about the first world war were usually rather distorted like Paul Fussells "great war and modern memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque "West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band joins a Bohemian Hall of Fame.
His book has the worst end, from which I've read in a non-fiction book.
I am no longer produced it.
But it is as if he would have caught us off with his book of this page with the main characters in the face and lit with a match.
