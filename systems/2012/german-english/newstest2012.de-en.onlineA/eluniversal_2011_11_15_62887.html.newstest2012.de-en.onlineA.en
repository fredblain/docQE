MSS announces a research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She heads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, supported by specialists of IPN Mexico's Social Security Institute.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexican Social Security Administration) announced that it leads a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", are to be used to found the genetic marker related to obesity.
Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquimica (Department of medical research, focus on biochemistry) at the clinic hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of built from doctors, nurses, food specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the post graduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sport facilities of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8: 00 A.m. tests are performed with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the West of the State of Mexico) started and will continue since 8 October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the East of the State of Mexico).
If the goal of 500 to 600 is reached investigation personnel, the study on the sports field of Independencia (in the South of the capital district) is continued and of Morelos (in the North of the capital district) completed on the.
He stated that the purpose of the study was getting to know the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and youth for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of world day of diabetes said he will aim that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents should fill out food-related questionnaires.
Also questions them about their physical activity and their familial history of the disease, to control risk factors which might cause diabetes or renal failure.
He carried out also that on these Saturdays the examination persons measured (weight, size, waist size), controlled their blood pressure and blood values, such as the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (try the identification of genes associated with obesity in childhood) determines would.
Cruz Lopez emphasized that this study be carried out on the occasion of the concern of health workers about the alarming weight gain in young people.
"The health interview surveys showed from 1999 and 2006 that the proportion of obese boys by 77 percent and the the girl with obesity by 47 percent have increased in almost six years." "Also the obesity has increased dramatically", the specialist of the IMSS is stressed.
He indicated that the search for genetic markers is justified, because the genetic history of the population of Mexico is differences of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexican (in) on average 65 percent Indian American, European and 5% African American is 30%, which reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity related.
In General, he said the genetics of obesity expresses in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) taken to us, so that this will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said immediate benefits for participants in the investigation would be a comprehensive survey of children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would studied even the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (Acanthosis) that indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All the information would be confidential and notified the parents in writing by doctors. The doctors tell parents all measurement results and suggest lifestyle changes them that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz Lopez stated that there were three basic factors which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that means missing movement in everyday life, to spend most of the day watching TV and using means of transport, to go instead of short distances on foot.
High calorie intake, that is to say, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high-fat and protein, and genetics, which should be analyzed in this research project.
