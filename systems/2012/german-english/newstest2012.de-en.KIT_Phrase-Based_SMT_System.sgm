<h1>
<seg id="1">Experts say a Stylist - must be a good psychologist</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">In the introductory article about how to learn Stylisten, I had a bit of gemeckert that it was a bit too much for the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="3">As I suspected, not in the least, which is yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing of problematic characters and a seminar on how the "place."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">It is worse to come.</seg>
<seg id="6">The closer we get to the examination, more information and practical tasks ahead of us.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">But even if the course every Saturday and Sunday will take place, it is full.</seg>
<seg id="8">This time we debated attracts with director Alena (the rate is not a single man), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">And these are, after all, most of us.</seg>
<seg id="10">Have a short neck, the other a young best figure without proper curves and others are mollig.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is a matter for the Stylisten to extend broad shoulders looks to conceal the neck or the necessary hervorzuzaubern curves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">We also got clues to how Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great, wide hip and pretty thin waists and attracts figure stresses that it is too provocative.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">If, for example, the difference between waists and waists is so great that the skirt or trousers really does not fit, you should at least cut a measure.</seg>
<seg id="14">It will certainly not repent, because well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a bar, constantly high and verrutscht in absteht waists, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Boys, formulaic characters, in turn, can afford to wear clothing with wrinkles, Bausch, applications, embroidery or Raffung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">This quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week for me to go through the head.</seg>
<seg id="18">And yet, I am afraid that it is almost impossible to achieve, given the assigned homework.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Each of the rate of domestic participants got a celebrity, for which they devise suitable Outfits - day clothes and evening wardrobe.</seg>
<seg id="20">We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of stars and Figurtyp.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">I should attract Miranda Kerr ,"" you may be out of the campaign, Victoria's Secret.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Inside, I juble, because it is much better for me personally, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has grown in recent times, the hundred kilos (okay, that is a bit exaggerated, or even the young Selena Gomez.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">The clothes we are supposed to consider reprinting from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then telegraphically.</seg>
<seg id="24">" In the Mood Board, the result is known, then our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">It is very important to think about the graphic side of the Stylings.</seg>
<seg id="26">The Stylist the models not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (concrete target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="27">This told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only on Sunday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">This means that a Stylist must have a good overview.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">With information on the types of characters filled Saturday lecture has been seasoned by three visitors from the industry:</seg>
<seg id="31">The Pokorný Stylisten Jan, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to exploit it.</seg>
<seg id="33">And eingeschickter Stylist with a single piece of clothing to work in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="34">The magic word is variability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">You can, for example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, paragraph shoes can attract and wear it as a dress.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is enough to roll up our sleeves or collar and the whole look is quite different.</seg>
<seg id="37"> "To play," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Most came but I want the following advice: "first you need to know what the rules are perfect."</seg>
<seg id="39">"Only then can they violate," said Jakub.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">At last, it is clear to me why we pauken all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if in fashion journals are often very different to see.</seg>
<seg id="41">A look of fashion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">Thanks to the photographer Ben, I now know that a Stylist clothing options much more prepared than he ultimately photographed.</seg>
<seg id="43">We therefore need to be prepared for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten Outfits) to stylen at least 15.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">And also that the clothing on the photograph, in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.</seg>
<seg id="45">With all that we must therefore expect the shaping of the Outfits.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">That image and sometimes Styl account for half of the success, which also confirmed Jan Pokorný.</seg>
<seg id="47">Since you need only Madonna, not brilliant singer from the image and marketing have made a world star.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather reserved.</seg>
<seg id="49">Well-known personalities, it is often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I turned out secondary).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">And if anyone stylen from us, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to be a very different (smaller) imposing size when he or she needs in reality.</seg>
<seg id="51">Then we need then to googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press, the celebrity was again or fallen, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">Jan and Mario on Sunday to believe that a Stylist only to focus on fashion and clothes, "assemble" needs.</seg>
<seg id="53">In his work, above all, he must communicate with the people, he stylt and he must be a psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="54">Assess people without curry and his opinion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"If any manager, in order to supplement their clothes cupboard to sift through and beautiful pieces, then we can't eliminate the entire wardrobe and say - my God, this is terrible."</seg>
<seg id="56">"We must find at least a few worthy, which recommends what you can wear," says Mario.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">He also showed us exactly what needs to be a so-called "pocket."</seg>
<seg id="58">So a bag in the zuknöpft waists and in all the necessary Proprietäten in.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">No such clear, such as scissors, Abroller to remove hair or safety needles, it also contains such Utensilien a nylon thread (the Stylist helps the photographing of products, such as handbags or hats), specific clips with the clothes will be killed if they are too big (outlets needles or other crunch banned the substance, not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60">But we must not only listen, but also can try something practical, we learned how to properly unterklebt shoes.</seg>
<seg id="61">The photography in the Atelier, where the floor you can damage the shoe bottom, let alone the outside.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">O screwed us and we screwed...</seg>
<seg id="63">With the gap should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.</seg>
<seg id="64">So you really have to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="65">Mario enjoyed, he praised my "creation" without restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="66">The skill is not my strength.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">All of this was just the fraction of what we hear on the second weekend serial course.</seg>
<seg id="68">One thing is now clear to me - to devote Styling at professional level, there is no pushover.</seg>

<seg id="1">V Need for steroids: "the run" - the illegal racing across America</seg>
<seg id="2">Recession</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, amateurish mistakes routine to Frühschicht.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was able to meet the ambitions of a large part of it, but what is the point, though it is obvious that no one had the inclination to do a bit more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Even before he came to the Ladentische evoking the new part with the subtitle " the run ' high expectations.</seg>
<seg id="6">He promised to postpone the bejahrte Games series ' need for speed, " a step in a new dimension and he seemed to be not only one of many action Rennspielen to be in the spielbaren demonstration examples.</seg>
<seg id="7">We were also curious as to how the lateral passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">But how it is used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade races, but overall, the game will be reduced by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.</seg>
<seg id="10">So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of incomprehensible in principle laziness of the games developers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The adventure begins very well.</seg>
<seg id="12">First introduced in the history of its main character, Jack has some problems of a personal nature; it seems to be the only solution to take part in an illegal race across America.</seg>
<seg id="13">In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel, with the task, to be the first in New York.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.</seg>
<seg id="15">The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than 50 individual race.</seg>
<seg id="16">This means that each race will be fought on the other line, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting milieu.</seg>
<seg id="17">No time has the impression that the game would be the same thing over and over again.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some environments are still very nicely, although not the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.</seg>
<seg id="19">So nothing earth-shattering news.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the journey through the desert, obvious autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">And atypical elements bring a bit of a change in the individual race.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm, the strong point of view.</seg>
<seg id="23">In the mountains, we must be careful, just as painful as that is not being buried by an avalanche.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Incidentally, are pretty well built in the individual race.</seg>
<seg id="25">Only a few, but they are.</seg>
<seg id="26">For a while, trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the Stoppuhr), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.</seg>
<seg id="27">And interfering nor the police, which wants to blow the whole thing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">A novelty passages in which Jack leaves the car.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is more certain interactive animation, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players, at the right moment the right button.</seg>
<seg id="30">So nothing complicated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is surprising, however, that there is much less such passages in the game, as you would expect (only three).</seg>
<seg id="32">This is ultimately a matter for the advantage, because at least has no chance of this element to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game varied.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts.</seg>
<seg id="34">In other words, seen from today's spotlight, it snaps no trees, on the other hand, you could not say it would be a bad thing.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="36">But an action-laden cyclist at the European Fahrmodell will continue to do quite well, although we could compete better.</seg>
<seg id="37">Until then, as far as everything.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Real problems only after a certain time.</seg>
<seg id="39">The collision model is not OK in contrast to the Fahrmodell</seg>
<seg id="40">It is a game of this kind is hard to expect that calculated complicated deformations and collisions, but in any impact on any object has a clue how the car is, obviously, not everything is in order.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">A typical example: close overhaul or pre-travel in accommodating cars ' touched ' only slightly in others, almost identical situation but the slings and turns wild performance in some places the other car.</seg>
<seg id="42">Or the Karre to scrap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">Thanks to the Restart system that makes nothing further, it is annoying.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Restarts are resolved: if you have damage or remote route, then raises the game back to the last point of reference.</seg>
<seg id="45">Only in each race has only five Restarts.</seg>
<seg id="46">If they are exhausted, everything is go.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Restarts are rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should rely on no one.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Sometimes, however, does not help the Restart, there is nothing more than to learn the critical section from the head.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is very embarrassed that the same things often happen at the same places.</seg>
<seg id="50">Some curves, we must go to very specific way, for example, otherwise it is not easy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">Elsewhere, it is the appropriate place "civilian" cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute.</seg>
<seg id="52">This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped in two forthcoming cars, but even there, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay.</seg>
<seg id="53">And it does not matter when it arrives, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">The opponents have other advantages.</seg>
<seg id="55">Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is always on the same spot will be overtaken by the same opponents again without regard to the timing.</seg>
<seg id="56">On Verrücktesten is at the end of the game in the long bridge, which is happening in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id="57">The opponent is obviously to overtake.</seg>
<seg id="58">And if he is already facing a, then that is the point of view, of course, so that they initially car a couple of times in Klump.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">Clearly, we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game.</seg>
<seg id="60">And that is a pity, because the game is quite entertaining despite easier Fahrmodell and also downloaded action so that almost no longer know where one of the head.</seg>
<seg id="61">And in principle, regardless of what is to blame - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of the race in a way that no volume of boredom, or something completely different...</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">An unusual idea is the change in the course of the race.</seg>
<seg id="63">We must overlook the stations on the route, because you can change the car, although in most cases, the car is enough, it has.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">The cars are divided into three categories.</seg>
<seg id="65">The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical journeys, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities from history.</seg>
<seg id="67">There is not just medals, but also to gain experience for their own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (challenges) and history.</seg>
<seg id="68">In order to achieve higher driver level must be open to various objects: from the car to the baker's grounds for the profile.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is also linked to the online function Autolog, among other things, its own results achieved with those of other comparing players and also provides for more collective functions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">An incomprehensible further blunders is a situation in the last race of the story.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here is the car in a subway tunnel (nay), where in the dark on the rail rast (nay).</seg>
<seg id="72">Look at the tachograph paragraphs between 150 (a) 200 km/h (far), but there is even an underground and drives an uncompromising to scrap.</seg>
<seg id="73">In our editorial, we will still argue about whether it was a blackout of game makers, or whether the authors for dopey.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing, in most cases, and even brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="75">Even more galling is that the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing in some exciting moments and sometimes quite dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="76">However, particularly the accidents with greater numbers of participation, where a continuous FPS anyway.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is a matter of taste.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a bid to raise such a broad as possible scale rather young audience, a Sound Track, a lá "every little" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? The feelings are more mixed.</seg>
<seg id="80">If the game is not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes, we can say with great conviction that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="81">But the game is somehow unfinished.</seg>
<seg id="82">A well done for pleasure, but we should be prepared that these errors with the power of airport lights in the eye.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of whack."</seg>
<seg id="4">I would not have expected such a hard war flares. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"It will take five or six years, until the dust settled, and all have become accustomed to their new role," girl Milena Vicenová began, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply their lecture at the law faculty.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">How seriously it takes the motto "understandable and openly about Europe," it showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a transparent and understandable way that some Lektor the law faculty of Charles University have been able to envy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Mrs Vicenová praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">" Initially, it was criticism that he was to work quietly - a grey civil servant, was not such a role, but I must say that it has ended up every breath, how well he has adopted the cause.</seg>
<seg id="9">" He is a person who will listen patiently to 27 member states to communicate with them and, in particular, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Should I call the new position of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said the answer to the question: who is this - the European Union what No? " As an important step for the agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Nobody wants to prohibit us from our Ölmützer Quargel</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">Mrs Vicenová dedicating the agenda, according to the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and the summit meeting for the Eastern Partnership.</seg>
<seg id="15">They described the fall of the government during the presidency as a big negative, severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the words of the ambassador, said it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is still not quite hectic.</seg>
<seg id="18">And since the seven-year budget to be approved by the EU, which makes the matter because of the current economic situation much more complicated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whether it is a slim and rigorous budget which industries priority countries more and less to be encouraged - all of which are now on the agenda.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The ambassador also recalls its own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "understandable on Europe."</seg>
<seg id="21">" If I do something, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon, nobody understands.</seg>
<seg id="22">How, as a citizen, I actually know whether we are really in Brussels curly or comes round cucumbers and different bananas or whether anyone actually wants to ban the Quargel.</seg>
<seg id="23">They had the soil, the EU also used in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Europe's two or different speeds in prospect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be euro-sceptic more negative than the positive sides of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even more galling is the poor representation of Czechs in European institutions.</seg>
<seg id="27">The fact that many factors are to blame, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least, the weak support for the Czech side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In addition to the successful Czech presidency, they also stressed the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, called the V4.</seg>
<seg id="29">" Believe me, if a pole or a Hungarian and a Slovak, is in the vicinity, the Frenchman believes beside me: " Hey, what is the heads together - that is already your V4? " And makes a pretty acid grin.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">According to Mrs Vicenové expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.</seg>
<seg id="31">As real as a "European Federation," it is the idea of a Europe of the two, or even different speeds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">" We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries outside the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="33">"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of reinforced cooperation."</seg>
<seg id="34">"For the first time, it was said that the countries should work together, and it does not want calm."</seg>
<seg id="35">"There will be more and more of such institutions, which ultimately on a strong" multi-speed Europe ,"" Mrs Vicenová expected.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy, in principle, according to all the issues affecting the whole of the EU must be discussed by all member states, and not just by the countries of the euro zone.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Fire story:</seg>
<seg id="2">The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="3">We are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word ' longevity. "</seg>
<seg id="4">For the general public, IBM is a synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The basis for the longevity of her first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, H.W.</seg>
<seg id="6">He argued the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people would be willing to consider a bit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">His slogan: ' Think! " Has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants should happen (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, when IBM issued in 1935).</seg>
<seg id="8">This was also the basis of carefully prepared by Watsen business culture.</seg>
<seg id="9">" For us, from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement towards the future.</seg>
<seg id="10">IBM survived and was also successful in a century, because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else around.</seg>
<seg id="11">This has enabled us to transform in the course of our first-century technology, business and society.</seg>
<seg id="12">We hope that we create, " said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company to mark the anniversary in the next hundred years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Thought-out system</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Watson ran in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way as entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had to be one of the first American employees paid leave insurance through employers, plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.</seg>
<seg id="15">The long-term relationship of IBM are equally subtle with their customers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to pick and choose accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="17">In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped by a woman from Virginia Rometty.</seg>
<seg id="18">It is 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the head Vetriebs, marketing and strategy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">IBM in recent years, so-called online brainstorm about many future strategies and innovations.</seg>
<seg id="20">There is no miracle ideas - it is enough, the company employs nearly half a million people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">An institution with a good reputation</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Their unshakeable position in the business to guarantee the company a strong image, and that domestic and foreign.</seg>
<seg id="23">"From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said The Economist, the professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.</seg>
<seg id="24">"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business to resolve problems through technology helps," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.</seg>
<seg id="25">The company pointed out, there is a difference in the market, only to be present or directly through this presence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">IBM - in the states of their logos for the family, "big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.</seg>
<seg id="27">It is one of the more competent technology companies - IBM hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product - from servers to nanotechnology.</seg>
<seg id="28">Of all the American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.</seg>
<seg id="29">His best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the Diskette.</seg>
<seg id="30">With around $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company (after Apple), for the first time since 1996, Microsoft outdated this year.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Looking ahead</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Not all products and innovations that met the tastes of customers today, unhappy with its own operating system, OS/2 were, for example, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC computer jr.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Business is based on the forward movement, so we must not emotional tie to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is why IBM has no problem with his reason to build walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave.</seg>
<seg id="35">Microsoft, in contrast to the opponent, in principle, with its operating system Windows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Promising technologies</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37">To participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to one-fifth.</seg>
<seg id="38">In 1990, hardware was still more than most fünfzigprozentigem share.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Since 2000, IBM sold invested little profits for big assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, it is $58 billion in shopping future technologies.</seg>
<seg id="40">In these investment drives, IBM also continue after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.</seg>
<seg id="41">Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first bosses loyal to Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression, increased its investment.</seg>
<seg id="42">So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis emerges unscathed.</seg>
<seg id="43">The value of IBM shares rose suddenly since 2008, missiles by 120 percent and profit of the company kontinuell grows.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The company's slogan is IBM: everything can change - not just the values.</seg>
<seg id="45">Therefore, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls the next crisis.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">IBM history: space flights from cheese Schneider</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The one hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated names - computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.</seg>
<seg id="48">The name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.</seg>
<seg id="49">The foundation stone for subsequent IBM society, the merger of four companies, whose history in the 1980s of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="50">They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration of work begins and ends.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board.</seg>
<seg id="52">And it was Flint, the head of the competition, the company stopped Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him in the management of the company.</seg>
<seg id="53">This Leader was the founder of IBM in the shade - Watson's ideas based until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.</seg>
<seg id="54">Watson led the company until 1952.</seg>
<seg id="55">IBM began, as the name betrays the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machinery for the trade of sausages and cheese tailors to cash.</seg>
<seg id="56">In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled their sales to $9 million and the company expanded, and on all continents.</seg>
<seg id="57">Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the head, then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">Under whose stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.</seg>
<seg id="59">In the 1960s helped technicians and computer from IBM, NASA to launch flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and the famous flight of people to the moon in 1969.</seg>
<seg id="60">Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System/360 in 1964.</seg>
<seg id="61">A classic PC, the computer-certain standards of the time, came in 1981 under the IBM 5150 names on the market.</seg>
<seg id="62">Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the Konsultanten part of the company, PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose entirely in the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value.</seg>
<seg id="63">The strategy, IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of ' Smarter Planet. "</seg>
<seg id="64">It embodies the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">In the commercial sector, IBM recently led the dealers to help the entire commercial cycle to guide the platform ' Smarter commerce. "</seg>
<seg id="66">IBM is also in the Czech Republic, a strong story.</seg>
<seg id="67">Already, in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - even the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.</seg>
<seg id="68">Today, IBM ČR, among other things, it is also a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.</seg>
<seg id="69">The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe, devolve in Prague and is also a top team of researchers from world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Development of the travel prices since 1989</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Travel agents then sold mainly only travel in the socialist bloc countries in the West were only exclusivity.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">And Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and an end to Hungary.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when they travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and were severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">It was a great paradox of socialist times that it is not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) has been allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.</seg>
<seg id="7">If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel impossible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Even then, the travel agents also had to travel to the West, but then you take huge queues in purchasing or spend sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.</seg>
<seg id="9">So the matter was still a long way.</seg>
<seg id="10">The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - has only been "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Czechoslovakia's currency was not freely exchangeable currency without foreign commitment, it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">During a holiday until 1989 in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries throughout the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">A huge paradox, today is not aware of the fact that it is able to travel to the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, not at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">From the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visit, especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Tschechoslowaken were able to get enough for a long time to travel to the West, not everyone wanted to be at least a couple of days.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Czech slept holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a vollgepackter boot with canned beer and permanent sausages, etc.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Our standard of living and the average salaries, which in 1997 led another important moment.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents regularly after 1997 to prepare for travel by charter flights, the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past subsidized unbelievable.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, what travel easier.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since then, each year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic, twelve exotic destinations.</seg>
<seg id="26">The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" marked development in 2008.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">On 17 November 2008, the United States join the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country under the advanced countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">In 2008, the Czechs spent the first time, more than half their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The main assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate.</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Almost five months for the Czech football has no chairman and that the successor will be aware of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="3">Until now, there is still no agreement about what should be chosen electoral law.</seg>
<seg id="4">And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successors.</seg>
<seg id="5">Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In June, came Hašek from his role, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to agree to find a strong personality, which could pass the football in the future.</seg>
<seg id="7">Only in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers class again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">That became clear on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.</seg>
<seg id="9">The delegates of the main assembly were free of the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial led to no result and it was not just the election itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">We could not agree on who is actually in the full collection is entitled to vote - only the statutory representatives or equipped with power officials.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the law, which makes a representation on a full basis is not.</seg>
<seg id="12">The disputes about the electoral law, however.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The executive committee also brought more clarity on the issue in meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if the views in relation to the election of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same.</seg>
<seg id="15">The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"The sticking point is the question of whether we should act in line with the statutes, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate, the greater prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Czech side is on the condition that the victor in this than in any other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">"The two Vorrunden would make no sense, this mode, the whole concept bicameral," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side to choose the best, the electoral law cannot be bent, but under current statutes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">This is also true, surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík, even if that statutory legitimate election of all the candidates most likely to think Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is my wish that largely after the statute."</seg>
<seg id="23">"No nonsensical concocted ersatz variants, such as at the last meeting," said the owner of football clubs Plzeň) Victoria, who is standing for the first time in his opinions, especially to Pelta demarcated.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Pelta remains optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="25">In his view, the new chairman in Nymburk be known, and he believes that the candidates work together constructively in the future.</seg>
<seg id="26">"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."</seg>
<seg id="27">"If the football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate more," according to the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten brings the most experience on both a professional and regional level.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Rajchl is more restrained.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is ambivalent."</seg>
<seg id="30">" It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to " zurechtzubiegen ' own purposes. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"Therefore, it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."</seg>
<seg id="32">"However, I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Just a lot of time left on the agreement by all sides.</seg>
<seg id="34">Some negotiations should be completely allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football's generals until the qualification game at all.</seg>
<seg id="35">The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice fly, on the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction did not launch sought for a replacement option as part of the executive committee, but the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">Ultimately, then, is the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="37">Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to an agreement.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is a lot at stake: state grants Vertrauungswürdigkeit Czech football and also the main assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka's new direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting would represent a strong candidate of the Czech Republic (FAČR) all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association, he would not allow the fight to this top position.</seg>
<seg id="41">"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."</seg>
<seg id="42">"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the head of the FAČR.</seg>
<seg id="44">Paclík also stressed that he plans to exercise if he wins the role of the chairman, only a year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers seen not involved in the football.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I have personally spoken with a number of eligible people."</seg>
<seg id="47">" Hard to believe that some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="48"> "Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">Most disturbing of all Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's influence with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.</seg>
<seg id="50">It is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman, held for Paclík.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."</seg>
<seg id="52">"The support Berbr a clever Businessman, the doubly bad football," Paclík stressed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="54">"I do not know what the prestige of a victory by Pelta (tsch) should bring in football."</seg>
<seg id="55">"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman," but a little more calmly.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">Paclík should win in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="57">Just thinks another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the General Assembly had supported in October, which ended with a fiasco.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">"He (Pelta) would be the first, I would go."</seg>
<seg id="59">"He has great skills."</seg>
<seg id="60">"I could well imagine him as head of the national team."</seg>
<seg id="61">"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."</seg>
<seg id="62">"I have my nose in matters, which I understand nothing," said Paclík in September for publicity, that he was behind the recall of the referee Luďěk Macela Commission was at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.</seg>
<seg id="64">And holding up his skills in the management of private firms since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."</seg>
<seg id="66">"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which resulted in sickening situations to degenerate," Paclík, no secret of his antipathy for example to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">As one of its priorities he would strengthen relations between the FAČR and Czech Olympic Committee, which he would lobbyieren political leaders for more money from the lottery tax in the sport.</seg>
<seg id="68">"It is one of the key things, the new chairman should pay."</seg>
<seg id="69">"If we play on the taxation of happiness, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money goes," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."</seg>
<seg id="71">Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.</seg>
<seg id="72">"It is not ideal."</seg>
<seg id="73">"I think it does not make much sense to transfer my shares Pilsner club hypocritical on a third-person return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="75">Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised to be one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his choice for the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="76">The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes the campaign will ensure a success of the Czech selection.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wants to focus in the event of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.</seg>
<seg id="78">He decided at the last minute to take part in the election before the last general meeting and might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">"People are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known at all levels."</seg>
<seg id="80">" He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.</seg>
<seg id="81">He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">He is convinced that responsible for today's problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="83">" Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as full as it had all been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="84">If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we have had a chair, " said Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="85">He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens ' association as bait for the delegates.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I should be chairman, then I take it personally, and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="87">"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">In addition, he is not trying to define his opponent.</seg>
<seg id="89">He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl he recognizes his legal education, and he knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">He also Tomáš Paclík took no more, no dry thread to Pelta.</seg>
<seg id="91">In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "</seg>
<seg id="92">"His attacks were unworthy and many people were shocked by his election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="93">"Now doubt many of its true nature," addressed Pelta his opponent, faithful to his proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">In his view, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, national team.</seg>
<seg id="95">And this should be the flagship Czech football.</seg>
<seg id="96">"I would also try to stop all affair - from the Bohemians to the echo of the corruption scandal last year."</seg>
<seg id="97">"Then I would plunge negotiations with private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole of football," said the forty-six year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">He also promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football will mean no personal cleansing.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I would have to start with the labour content of all employees," he said in the direction of the Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably nervous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100">Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not wasted on Thursday after Nymburk.</seg>
<seg id="101">"If we really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Football needs credibility and he wins only if he has a new leader," Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his career officials optimistic.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103">Rajchl promises that the FAČR hard to work under him begins</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">When the deputy chairman of Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, which would allegedly spoiled many people in the club's whim.</seg>
<seg id="105">Rajchl promises that we are working hard in the event of his election to begin.</seg>
<seg id="106">He wants to introduce the system changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.</seg>
<seg id="107">He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."</seg>
<seg id="109">Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football performance for the youth. "</seg>
<seg id="110">"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the powers in the executive committee, so that each member pays a certain area."</seg>
<seg id="112">And I will distribute hard tasks, so that the football in each segment at a time. "</seg>
<seg id="113">Moreover, many were delighted not to criticize because they, rather than just the work of others, now really ought to work hard, " he added.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have taken into consideration, not to run again.</seg>
<seg id="115">"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."</seg>
<seg id="116">"But I must know that it makes sense that people are behind me, I am not constantly spokes and every step, I am in," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.</seg>
<seg id="117">"Many people have told me that I would not give up, because others do."</seg>
<seg id="118">"It is confidence, we must not squander," he said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">He allegedly motivated him, to continue the work, which began under Hašek.</seg>
<seg id="120">"We have a great deal of work done in two years, and now I am not just throw away."</seg>
<seg id="121">"It has been launched processes only in a couple of years and I would hate to see that someone stopp," he said, and expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something not Mirek Pelta."</seg>
<seg id="123">"Behind him, above all, people would make football so that he would be only for exclusivity."</seg>
<seg id="124">I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "</seg>
<seg id="125">"I am trying to be objective."</seg>
<seg id="126">"I want to football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">It also contradicts the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.</seg>
<seg id="128">"Even if some people claim to do the opposite, I really have the best possible result for Moravia."</seg>
<seg id="129">"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian, whose winners in each of the first league felt."</seg>
<seg id="130">"It might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">Because the head of the Tomáš Pilsner clubs Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he will be elected.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as a success.</seg>
<seg id="133">On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association, not in a single direction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Nobody can question in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."</seg>
<seg id="136">"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has started and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change radically."</seg>
<seg id="137">He would certainly not want altered just to suit in his favour, " Rajchl judging on his rivals.</seg>

<seg id="5">A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">When Iris Meder in the past year and a half of research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.</seg>
<seg id="7">Rücklings on water, they looked into art shaped cupolas, they swam marble-Putten, the peripheral basins were waiting for them, and was amazed on meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.</seg>
<seg id="8">She liked a bath, she took it in great haste, in her book notice - office knowledge values details about the design and history of the building.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">More than 200 pools are finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her published book "bathing pleasures": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus region near Frankfurt.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Thirteen countries by their "journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The 46-year-old German is a real culture of bathing enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="12">They do not have much in the hat with sports, says Meder - only in the water.</seg>
<seg id="13">Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while Jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.</seg>
<seg id="15">"So I began to collect beautiful spas."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Surface water doubled architecture</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The Wellness factor in bathrooms Geplätscher in leap basins and essential sauna oils - is so great, because all sense, so Meder.</seg>
<seg id="18">And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "instead of a floor in dipping water surface."</seg>
<seg id="19">"It is transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."</seg>
<seg id="20">All doubles blend: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, boards leap.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The kleinformatige picture band gives "bathing pleasures" 190 pages on the value of knowledge about the historic architecture and cultural history of wellness-oases - but especially for a leap in the dark.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Meder collector with her research in Hungary.</seg>
<seg id="23">Alongside magnificent medical spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water in bottles shaped buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).</seg>

<seg id="24">Spectacular prospects, however, offer many free heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city, you can see in the external pool of Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and, in Dampfbad, there is a window from the activities at the ski Piste.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length of the field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a landed in the Alps Ufo.</seg>
<seg id="26">Three dampft open nuts in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals excel in the sky.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="28">Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="29">Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so strong for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed.</seg>
<seg id="30">The smell comes from the hydrogenkarbonathaltigen alkali water cure, it is almost black and Schlick a stain on the skin, once you are sliding into the pool - a wellness-experience special article</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">In a place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites but also disappointed: they wanted to visit the free and the period of time in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a locked terrain.</seg>
<seg id="32">From 1902 Dušan Jurkovic architects shaped bath has now been closed.</seg>
<seg id="33">As Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw how weeds has grown between the tiles.</seg>

<seg id="35">Three construction schedules has discovered this bad already; you can't just neoromanische elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added around 1900.</seg>

<seg id="2">German bank leaves commodity business by lights</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">Christian Teevs</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Deutsche Bank is on their business with agricultural commodities?</seg>
<seg id="5">After SPIEGEL-ONLINE information Josef Ackermann asked a working group to examine the impact of speculation for the poor of the world.</seg>
<seg id="6">In January, the company chief want to draw conclusions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Hamburg -</seg>
<seg id="8">The matter is clear for the German citizens: 84 percent of Germans think it is not acceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.</seg>
<seg id="9">Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other lenders from this business, because it exacerbates the problems of the poorest in the world.</seg>
<seg id="10">This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.</seg>
<seg id="12">The author shows Harald Schumann that bets on global stock exchanges, commodity prices - and the banks are therefore an accessory on global hunger problem.</seg>
<seg id="13">The campaign of consumer protector is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, even if big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Commodity bets were originally intended for traders against price fluctuations.</seg>
<seg id="15">But most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Unlike the US competitors reacted Ackermann to the criticism: he promised to investigate the allegations and said that no business it is "worth the good name of the Deutsche Bank to gamble."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">According to the information provided by SPIEGEL ONLINE an International Labour is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch Report.</seg>
<seg id="18">The review to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation on how this should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the end of January, the then head of the bank say what consequences.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the end, could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Ackermann fusses over his image</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time, his criticism of the financial industry: "betting on rising food prices illustrates dramatically as reckless banks of the public."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The Deutsche Bank must remove all plants from its portfolio, where money will be used to take bets on food prices," said Bode.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Regardless of whether it is Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people or the reputation of the Deutsche Bank."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The understanding of Ackermann is surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the company chief a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Monday, the Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO differently than planned, will not change in the board.</seg>
<seg id="28">With a move away from the controversial agricultural speculation he could be pumping up his image.</seg>
<seg id="29">And possible losses he needs very little to do - after all, could have his successor.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Every second would terminate commodity assets</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Foodwatch trying to keep the pressure on the manager.</seg>
<seg id="32">So far, more than 30000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="33">On Tuesday, Bode published the poll, for which the institute Forsa 1001 people interviewed on 7 and 8 November.</seg>
<seg id="34">Just 11 percent think it is legitimate that the Deutsche Bank facilities, where bets on food prices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Many bank customers would also be personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: half of the poll, according to terminate all installations where money is flowing into commodity speculation.</seg>
<seg id="36">43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank to cancel 49% to reflect their accounts and to switch to another institution.</seg>

<seg id="4">An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958, won prizes in Vienna museum was empty and descended.</seg>
<seg id="5">Now, he will be re-opened as an exhibition.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical for the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example.</seg>
<seg id="7">Tail pavilion at the Grand Prix d ' Architecture for his easy and pending operates steel-glass design.</seg>
<seg id="8">The building is now a landmark contemporary architecture.</seg>
<seg id="9">He made the architects know that Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was 1973, finally internationally famous with his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem side in Munich.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">His planned as a temporary exhibition pavilion had converted one of the world exhibition at the Swiss garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, and in 1962, it opened a museum of the 20th century - the 1920s house it was called.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was likely the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.</seg>
<seg id="13">Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, until the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.</seg>
<seg id="14">Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he now says, "21er House" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.</seg>
<seg id="16">Tuesday evening, the museum opened Belvedere, the house is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">Through the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco, in 2007, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.</seg>
<seg id="18">Husslein-Arco, holders of art historian with considerable career in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting strongly among politicians and conservationists monument, they acquired public funds and private sponsors ' money and use.</seg>
<seg id="19">Should contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Strict supervision, small budget</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.</seg>
<seg id="22">Not only because of its sensitive converted Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and expanded and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was an "incredibly important place" where he was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="23">He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which is already in its transfer to Vienna and lost his Umnutzung of generosity and lightness.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The current renovation, there were far greater problems: the building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.</seg>
<seg id="25">The windows profiles of the glass facade have changed, enhanced fiber glass insulation and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.</seg>
<seg id="26">Bridges cold steel makers have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="27">Two -got room for the new use, a reduced light gap between house and road for Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.</seg>
<seg id="28">The original external doors are removed, the house is in the old rotbraunen rust protection Farbton.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.</seg>
<seg id="30">And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Often a material had to be found, that is a good thing, and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive ground in -.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">Despite all the constraints, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is been difficult with the pavilion, " daherkam from Brussels, " said Krischanitz recently, a typical ' Drop-in-the-City history. "</seg>
<seg id="34">So an architecture "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">In this case, the 21er house, however, is not entered in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: around the Swiss garden is just completely planned ' Central Station Quartier ' office and residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="36">And another fluke may still happen: the 21er households could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre art hall, and we hear that it is negotiating with the city a neighbourly location within the Swiss garden.</seg>

<seg id="1">The threat is real</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the discovery of " Zwickauer cell ' Turkish media in the German state of law.</seg>
<seg id="3">A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" now resurgent.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The murders of eight Turkish ethnic and Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000-2006, had a legal extremist background.</seg>
<seg id="5">This news will be in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany reacted with fear and concern.</seg>
<seg id="6">For many German türken returns in a long totgeglaubtes ghost: since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with legal extremist background against Turks.</seg>
<seg id="7">That in Germany there is xenophobia, however, was never in question.</seg>
<seg id="8">This revealed right-wing extremist network reveals, however, proportions, whose dimension is still a long way.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">"The bloody ideology lives again?" The headline in the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."</seg>
<seg id="10">The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators have been a V-man of constitutional protection, and expresses concern that German authorities could be involved in the radical right quagmire.</seg>
<seg id="11">She calmly responded the Turkish community of Germany: remembered at the weekend with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate, the victims of racist violence.</seg>
<seg id="12">Only two weeks earlier had thought the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.</seg>
<seg id="13">In cheery colours was orchestrated coexistence - a history of success.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">As a slap in the face because the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the Fünfzigsten" is the title of an article in the Turkish Internet platform, "Haber X," cites the background to the series of murders.</seg>
<seg id="15">The German edition of the "Hürriyet" it is not to take these ideas.</seg>
<seg id="16">"It starts to stink," the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.</seg>
<seg id="17">He stressed that people have been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany have done with their work.</seg>
<seg id="18">It will be extremely critical discussion in German Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and later investigative success.</seg>
<seg id="19">Why the German authorities is not much more, to look for suspects in extremist circles, the authors wonder.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some shows, at least rhetorically, to drastic measures: "will continue to be done here, the migrants have no other option than self-defence and weapons."</seg>
<seg id="21">"This is probably the best self-protection."</seg>
<seg id="22">"The quality of the Enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks demonstrated by Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.</seg>
<seg id="24">The photograph of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because no other event showed the Turks living more apparent that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that can lead to mistrust and distance in right-wing violence.</seg>
<seg id="26">The attacks, however, raised their feelings on the Turkish side.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Not to repeat the mistakes of the past</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">In the Turkish press was particularly criticised the failure of German policy after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.</seg>
<seg id="29">After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish President, however, represented by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel at the funeral in Cologne - Kinkel was in his speech on how many charges for domestic Turks.</seg>
<seg id="30">As calculated the value of a human after its tax levies.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">The current coverage of the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the domestic law since then.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition to the efforts of a wide-ranging education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs open words this time.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">The bank scandal by Zürisee</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The bizarre bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="3">The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is now a German.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">So it was Axel Weber, certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="6">After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was known in July that he would be 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: President of the Council of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="8">"UBS has managed the Turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">But in September, it became clear that everything would be different.</seg>
<seg id="11">A UBS trader in London had been gambling found all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to go.</seg>
<seg id="13">The UBS board president since also - and everyone is asking: when is Axel Weber?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Already, it became known that Weber advised the bank from February 2012.</seg>
<seg id="15">And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">This will be hard for Axel Weber.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is not a banker, much more economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.</seg>
<seg id="18">At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that they have long been the title of largest bank scandal of Europe ."</seg>
<seg id="19">Because UBS is huge - until recently, it was the largest asset managers in the world - and on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nothing, it seems, the once-proud Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">It started in the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="22">Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager she had combined with ambitious targets: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very big number.</seg>
<seg id="24">The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">This made impression.</seg>
<seg id="27">The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger told: "my students, I have the UBS always depicted as a model of good banking."</seg>
<seg id="28">"From today's point of view, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">He wrongly huge.</seg>
<seg id="30">For the first time that something belonging went wrong in the UBS in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="31">The middle of the year was surprising CEO Peter Wuffli, which was seen as highly intellectual and ingenious bankers.</seg>
<seg id="32">A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.</seg>
<seg id="33">The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.</seg>
<seg id="34">In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of 13 billion francs.</seg>
<seg id="35">It was actually investors, but what about some until shortly before the gerümpft nose: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so quiet that not even his name.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">But that was only the first blow.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was worse in April 2008.</seg>
<seg id="38">The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland came back.</seg>
<seg id="39">In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.</seg>
<seg id="40">The National Bank of UBS bought problematic for tens of billions of securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a compulsory convertible loan, they could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because they said how dramatic it is for a small country, if it accommodates large banks.</seg>
<seg id="42">Finally, the balance sheet was the UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).</seg>
<seg id="43">"We could not save the UBS," banking researcher Geiger says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">The first disaster of the second.</seg>
<seg id="45">A few months later, the UBS surrendered in tax dispute with America and prepared to publish the data with significant customers, perhaps with the help of the bank taxes evaded.</seg>
<seg id="46">They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business office criminal surcharge.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">The UBS known more or less open to tax evasion.</seg>
<seg id="48">At the same time, they lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: an aura of secrecy.</seg>
<seg id="49">After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.</seg>
<seg id="50">It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board president.</seg>
<seg id="51">And the exodus of customers ' money.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">The bank had lost in two key areas of business within a few months of their credibility: investment banking through the speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will been gambling found it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it seems to be: with the risk management in the investment banking work obviously still not.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control, little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="56">The financial board of a major German bank is safe: "the problem is the UBS, that they will not risk control under control."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers taken a long time ago, the guardian of the great assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - may also break the world beyond the Alpine republic.</seg>
<seg id="58">The coffers of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The UBS headquarters in Zurich, fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.</seg>
<seg id="60">The situation is classic.</seg>
<seg id="61">The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road, which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee, flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.</seg>
<seg id="62">The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="63">As jeweller Tiffany's place here between Swiss traditional shops as the Confiserie Sprüngli.</seg>
<seg id="64">For centuries, the Swiss banks: from the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door.</seg>
<seg id="66">Inside the walls are dressed marble, are thick leather armchairs, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for ' safe '.</seg>
<seg id="67">The UBS knows what the customer: security.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68">This idea of the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small private Swiss bank.</seg>
<seg id="69">His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, finally, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks do business.</seg>
<seg id="70">The UBS is far too big, it will take place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons.</seg>
<seg id="71">The Swiss had nothing more to say.</seg>
<seg id="72">"And if they have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">Indeed, it was modified the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its high profits and induced the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the sub-jungle as the big Swiss bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">The disaster has been visible on 15 October 2008.</seg>
<seg id="75">"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Hässig Lukas, in his book, "the UBS-crash."</seg>
<seg id="76">Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly EUR 45 billion allocated to the politicians, the bankruptcy to save large bank.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">How could this happen?</seg>
<seg id="78">When you talk with Swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.</seg>
<seg id="79">In June 1998, joined by two of the three major Swiss banks to a huge corporation.</seg>
<seg id="80">There was a bank when the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">It helped that the two different precursor-supplemented banks UBS: a rich, but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and poorer, but more internationalized.</seg>
<seg id="82">Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money, they were able to turn a huge wheel.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the group's head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the board.</seg>
<seg id="84">"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="85">"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man has worked from the bank lesson to the very top."</seg>
<seg id="86">But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.</seg>
<seg id="87">And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.</seg>
<seg id="88">"It is a tragic case."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">Tragic, perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="90">It is clear: frolic came before the fall.</seg>
<seg id="91">UBS employees remember clearly the leadership meetings where company chief Wuffli the same purported slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.</seg>
<seg id="92">The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.</seg>
<seg id="93">They led the League Tables, " rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.</seg>
<seg id="94">In the meantime, the UBS, according to the top.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95">Some steps were already succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the foreign exchange business and equity trading, she played at the top.</seg>
<seg id="97">Corporate advisers who have been charged, but a weakness: international business interest in the language of bankers ' Fixed-income, " there is a huge gap with the largest banks.</seg>
<seg id="98">The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost the existence.</seg>
<seg id="100">Hungry for growth, invested both the bank itself, as well as a liberating in their hedge funds in the US sub-prime assets.</seg>
<seg id="101">It became a huge machine, packaged securities on American mortgage loans and reached - but also maintained risks.</seg>
<seg id="102">Also, when other banks exit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"In the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was going up in flames, UBS has bought," says banking expert Geiger.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">The euphoria is so deep.</seg>
<seg id="105">A manager to go after the other, more difficult than the attempts to clean up than thought.</seg>
<seg id="106">Posts in UBS were Schleudersitz and shaky until today.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.</seg>
<seg id="108">He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which lost all obvious business models.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">Banks researchers Geiger has an idea: stop the investment banking, concentrating on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.</seg>
<seg id="110">So far, the bank will not (yet).</seg>
<seg id="111">But the investment banking to shrink, so much is already clear.</seg>
<seg id="112">On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti to imagine his future strategy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="113">The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only intended as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.</seg>
<seg id="114">Meanwhile, he has pushed through: he should lead the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ermotti wants the investment bank to back in the mid-1990s.</seg>
<seg id="116">He is cutting 3500 jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="117">But that is not enough.</seg>
<seg id="118">The UBS needs a vision.</seg>
<seg id="119">Who is it?</seg>
<seg id="120">They want to earn money?</seg>
<seg id="121">These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.</seg>
<seg id="122">Publicly, he says only that he and his wife, once an apartment in Zurich.</seg>
<seg id="123">Next year.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="12">There was a controversial project in 2005, the mass killing of crow in the district for negative-headlines.</seg>
<seg id="13">Critics had called the trapping of the animals in the birds and the Erschlagen with cudgels as particularly brutal.</seg>

<seg id="6">He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for Literature.</seg>
<seg id="7">He has written an unusual book that he is not incorrect as "a work of anti-history."</seg>
<seg id="8">It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and sentiments."</seg>
</p>

<seg id="12">Some prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.</seg>
<seg id="13">Each of these lives come as the Votivkerzen in a church, some added, while others fade away.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.</seg>
<seg id="15">It also corrected the idea of the First World War was just devastating positions of war on the Western Front.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Beauty and horror" ends with a view of experts on other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.</seg>
<seg id="17">The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse fly an intractable problem.</seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="19">The war flooded the lives of these people as a natural disaster like a hurricane Katrina, reeks of Kordit.</seg>
<seg id="20">Imagine you are a woman who stay at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You or you take the flight?</seg>
<seg id="21">Anyone at all?</seg>
<seg id="22">Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war at all.</seg>
<seg id="23">"The lack of facts," Englund says, "have been improved with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty and horror" individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other published material.</seg>
<seg id="26">Their reports can be frightening or simple, but they are very much alive in the Englunds depreciating accumulation in details of small moments.</seg>
<seg id="27">Many of them act of shortages and bush redress.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the history of a German school girl, he told: "spare everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Spare coffee, wrong aluminium, false Radiergummi, paper associations, wood buttons."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">He told the dinner in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="31">He describes "meat made from pressed rice and cooked in Hammelfett (and most recently served with a false bone from wood), tobacco, made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes, besohlt timber."</seg>
<seg id="32">There was, as he noted, "837 registered food replacement funds were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511; registered coffee substitute."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Some stories of honor and bravery.</seg>
<seg id="34">An American who recognizes his own drive for the game and says about the war: "one feels that, despite everything, that is what it was for men to sit in Lehnstuhl to do with the evening tide or bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky, and so is such a façade of civilisation and there would be no barbarism behind its own strengthened and literate breast shirt."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Conversely, a British soldier acknowledges that he will probably die and nobody notice or care.</seg>
<seg id="36">"If you would like the idea of self-sacrifice, we think that this is happening in front of a crowd," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="37">Instead, it is terrible how "a convicted man was hanged in secret."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Other observations of the old Europe fall apart, and on new types of terror.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The conflict has been a growing economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."</seg>
<seg id="40">He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century": "the eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderer in the yardstick of the slaughter, while he sits behind a desk."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivolous behavior, such as Heroismus.</seg>
<seg id="42">Englund is discussing the soldiers who actively sought a prostitute infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front.</seg>
<seg id="43">"The grotesque expression can be discovered in trade with Gonokokken-Eiter, bought for soldiers and their genitals, greased hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Those were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and unintrusive and fits perfectly with its human task.</seg>
<seg id="46">In dozens of small scenes he unleashed the way, as the war "in a unique way of uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."</seg>
<seg id="47">People are beginning to ask themselves why their leaders for fighting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">The best books about the First World War were distorted, rather like Paul Fussell ' Great War and Modern Memory, " or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques " in the West is nothing new, " as the extensive history books.</seg>
<seg id="49">Englunds band enters an unconventional glory hall.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">His book has the most devastating end, I have read in a factual book.</seg>

<seg id="14">"The only people who knew that the Zuccotti Park, for example, were high-ranking officials of the portfolio."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">The carers union will lodge a complaint against the city because of layoffs</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The union, hundreds of workers last month, have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the layoffs because of their disproportionate influence on the schools, which teach poor students are not necessary and discriminatory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The complaint is probably the last chance of the union local council, 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, is still open.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sechshundert seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other staff who had been among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on October 7, in a move that lost their jobs, the union leaders described as a political revenge for that in the past year, the city's access to a health fund, the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">This accusation has been categorically rejected by the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="6">At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools in the last month, the redundancies were part of the budget that passed in June.</seg>
<seg id="7">A town council member shot back and said that the budget would not specify that the school aid will be made redundant.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Officials from the City Council 37 said they have warned the Ministry of Education in a complaint, and it will give a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan, formally announced on Wednesday.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Mr. Walcott the complaint and the Ministry of Education as a defendant in the city and eight laid-off workers count as plaintiffs, all of which are coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said the city would not be the complaint and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has lost to the number of redundancies in schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city, focused a complaint for discrimination to support claims that poor schools, more aid workers, because they are chronically underfunded.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">It points out that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island, and only a few redundancies in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 schools in Brown's Ville, Brooklyn, and have lost 46 helpers in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx were made redundant in the district of 23.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">With the loss of five of eight school volunteers, who were in the public school, 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "this is not a wealthy few neighborhood parents can organise donations to offset budget cuts."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">P.S.: the budget of the 36th southern this year has been cut by 3.26 per cent, and also lost money, the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung changed.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The union also complained that the heads of the high schools were led by the language in a memo, which approved the dismissal of care coordinators.</seg>
<seg id="16">The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess" (German: transfer) in the United States usually exchange a teacher from the payroll describes a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central office.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">"Sixty six care coordinators were sacked, not transferred," the complaint says.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">On Thursday, the Committee for international relations of the Senate resolution, which commends Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, which began with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerry.</seg>
<seg id="6">"It is a reaffirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">This summer, lawmakers squabbled both parties and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions on the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission to NATO.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">In June, Kerry and McCain approved a resolution to the limited use of military force by the United States in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="10">The law was thrown out by a broad fringe of both parties in the Senate, and there was no vote.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">But fell on the same day, this bill in the Senate by also outvoted the chamber of a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.</seg>
<seg id="12">The US mission ran into a kind of legislative purgatory - with Congress, which was upset enough to criticize Obama's approach in the framework of the mission, but not angry enough to definitively the rug from under our feet.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Then the indecisiveness of Congress overtaken by events.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tripoli fell in August among the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.</seg>
<seg id="15">The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Now the Senate is perhaps ready for action.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The resolution of the committee for international relations, "congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and extraordinary stamina in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the US military and its coalition partners, the support of the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irrevocable Libya's transition to democracy."</seg>

<p>
<seg id="19">The new measures will receive the full support of the body for foreign relations or they will divide the legislators, as it has done the law in June?</seg>

<seg id="27">There are at least 15 versions in the Senate, the compensatory budget amendment and another dozen "controlling federal spending."</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - especially starters with the Republicans, who want to burnish their CV - the opportunity to boast that they have such a measure '. "</seg>

<p>
<seg id="29">The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both the Senate and Congress to vote on an amendment to the budget is balanced.</seg>
<seg id="30">In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such an amendment.</seg>

<seg id="1">The military is under growing pressure to in rape</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">This week, an important hearing decides whether 28 men and women because of non-intervention in a rape to be charged before the military court.</seg>
<seg id="3">It should not have hundreds of plaintiffs for the next hearing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Who Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week than at night by a fellow soldier was raped.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was back in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleague 12er Pack beer in.</seg>
<seg id="6">He asked whether he is likely to have a drink in her room.</seg>
<seg id="7">"My alarm went," Lyman said.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the Texanerin dismissed their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="9">I thought: ' Oh, he is 19.</seg>
<seg id="10">He is from Texas, " she said.</seg>
<seg id="11">"I wish I had listened to my gut feelings."</seg>
<seg id="12">A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped, she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">This week, on 18 November, Lyman waiting and 27 other current and former military employees have a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, which will be decided whether a lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complaint alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld are not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., included the complaint initially 17 plaintiffs, but the increases in the following months, 28: 25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify, to condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks to provide.</seg>
<seg id="16">Burke says it is monitoring the top military leadership, because the problem is where to begin.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The military is hierarchical," she says.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation of the leadership."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Burke also says that she has been in contact since February, almost 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future claims.</seg>
<seg id="20">Their strategy: instead of all claimants were laying their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints in order to keep up the pressure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The team of defending for the Defense Ministry, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has made a request for legal action.</seg>
<seg id="22">The files of the court, Newsweek, lead the defense strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for violations in the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because of a law to the Supreme Court from 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, the government is liable for violations that soldiers are currently on active service.</seg>
<seg id="24">"The alleged damage caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document says.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">Things have changed since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="27">If women are not permitted to the service in the fight, it is the only distinction in the name: modern wars have seldom clear fronts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers increasingly important roles, particularly in the conditional contact with indigenous women in war zones.</seg>
<seg id="29">The result: died 150 female soldiers, two-thirds of them in clashes between the two wars.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is time that the military will be modernised, Burke says.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">And she is not alone in their fight: three other complaints, except their are pending.</seg>
<seg id="32">At Yale Law School, the veteran ' Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a misogynistic atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="33">This independent, the non-profit Vietnam veteran of America, a complaint against the military in the diagnosis of "personality disorder" to dismiss the rape victims received them from the service - a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Their group was in December, a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which she accused her discriminatory practices in its dealings with entitlements for people who claimed to be sexually abused in the service.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">Nine laws has been presented separately by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.</seg>
<seg id="36">In 2010, according to the sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3158 sexual abuses.</seg>
<seg id="37">But most of the abuses are not registered at all, and after its own estimate of the Pentagon's account of the number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19000 cases, per year.</seg>
<seg id="38">The report, which was published in March, also examined the rates of law enforcement: 2010 came 20 per cent of registered cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39">The plaintiffs in the case of Burke's describe their attacks as only the first of a series of trauma.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the case of Lymans reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.</seg>
<seg id="41">On this night, she says she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape of a whole series of policemen, doctors and commanders.</seg>
<seg id="42">She had a Vergewaltigungsset and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a section of his arm, was found in her bed.</seg>
<seg id="43">Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked after the sex they had before the attack with her boyfriend.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six people said that as a character witness on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which was ultimately acquitted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.</seg>
<seg id="46">"I thought I would go into labor, I ran screaming from the courtroom."</seg>
<seg id="47">"They brought me in the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came back, my commander said: this was not his procedure, which was my procedures."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Lyman was invited to visit a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and unable to service.</seg>
<seg id="49">It has been disgracefully redundant, so that they have no support in January 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">Whether the complaint submitted Lyman and the other plaintiff, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at the George Washington University Law School.</seg>
<seg id="51">Nevertheless, he notes: "I think they should move forward."</seg>
<seg id="52">What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticised for the first time, it called into question.</seg>
<seg id="53">I am living a critic of the Feres Doctrine.</seg>
<seg id="54">The military is lagging behind a decade because they do not have the same incentive and deterrence, the liability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">He adds: "the odds are against them... but it is important for them to try."</seg>
<seg id="56">These things will only change if good people are ready to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer of the plaintiffs, with hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.</seg>
<seg id="58">"We will continue to fight the military in this regard, until it comes to reform," she says.</seg>
<seg id="59">Or until we die, which always comes first.</seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1">Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe was Anders Behring Breivik, only one of many boys, their anti-immigration views online.</seg>
<seg id="3">On Monday, had Breivik has confessed to a killing spree in Norway in July, in which 77 people were killed, its first public hearing before the court.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although Breivik acted alone, it is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack before his computer, and with some of the millions of gechattet nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.</seg>
<seg id="5">After the tragedy of this summer, wanted more researchers to find out about these people.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, as we find them?</seg>
<seg id="7">It is easy - you only have to connect to Facebook.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"We have noticed that it was not difficult to come to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Face Books hide personal data is enzyklopädisch, Bartlett says that the researchers simply use the advertising tool alongside their desired demographic data to determine exactly with scientific precision, as do retailers for years.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bartletts team held a half-million fans of extreme-right groups in Europe and reshaped it with Adds to connect, but instead with a new band or a new diet product, Adds invited users to a poll in which their education, their attitude towards violence and was asked to assess their own future.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - that they just have to leave their office.</seg>
<seg id="12">"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="13">Some of the results hardly come as a surprise, online promoter of extreme-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">But in a kind of distortion, surprisingly, are those who combine their online activism with offline activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">DEMOs work is just one example of how Facebook will become a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends, such as ' Likes ' text messages and status updates.</seg>
<seg id="17">With more than 800 million active users, on average, add three content per day, Face Books generates data supernova explosion, " a research boom, the number of scientific work by the name of this side in the title of almost 800% in the last five years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that you can study this side of people not normally with his Clipboard on the street.</seg>
<seg id="19">"If you previously tried to interview people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."</seg>
<seg id="20">"They had to first inform the party and they would never have access," says Bartlett.</seg>
<seg id="21">"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Others say that the side offers an opportunity to identify and solve social health problems.</seg>
<seg id="23">A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who drink their full binge on Facebook, significantly more problem than students who remained silent on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreno proposes that equal students, for example, residential advisers to monitor and help a student if they have too many post status updates.</seg>
<seg id="25">"They can't solve a problem if you have not recognized it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-writer and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Facebook also zapft the data to his own people.</seg>
<seg id="28">The data team has compiled statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a national happiness index (primarily used data on the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long known that the side of their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) </seg>
<seg id="29">But the Facebook users know that the side they watched, whether or not they now want to be able to play with a friend, thousands of miles away, Scrabble sown, allows for the side's own personal data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">But what if the users of Facebook will be part of a survey that they do not even know something?</seg>
<seg id="31">While researchers have strict guidelines laid down their offline data collection is online.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I do not believe that many users have thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge lab, a study in 2006, in which he studied the public side of students on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="33">"What they are concerned, it was all about them and their friends."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">Then there is the question of methodology.</seg>
<seg id="35">Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.</seg>
<seg id="36">It is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile, and contributions are true on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="37">"What we say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook, are two entirely different things," says Selwyn.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Therefore, Selwyn thinks despite his years as a technology researchers that Clipboard and a pencil are still the best research tool, anyone can use.</seg>
<seg id="39">"There is no substitute for the real world and to speak with real people," he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Social research must look at the social - and a lot of social life is still offline."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Cold and inhuman": unlike Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Unlike Behring Breivik, the man who runs two amok, which this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" to fight.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight temple of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting the hate ideologies and multiculturalism."</seg>
<seg id="5">"I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">Judges canceled Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue, because he wanted to give "Breivik, not the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."</seg>
<seg id="7">For the same reason, he refused to cohere Breivik, a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for another 12 weeks in custody, it will be four weeks, with no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.</seg>
<seg id="10">Some were hoping to see Breivik's eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars.</seg>
<seg id="11">All were with the goal, that Wegschließen.</seg>
<seg id="12">"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.</seg>
<seg id="13">"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard suspects."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted calmly and professionally throughout the hearing, and he looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered the building and left.</seg>
<seg id="15">Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" move, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.</seg>
<seg id="16">There may be some that the attacks on 22 July, apparently, was the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.</seg>
<seg id="17">But this will make it easier to automatically senses the heartache and the confusion of a whole nation still?</seg>
<seg id="18">"I wish he would look like a monster, but it does not," said the relatives of a victim.</seg>

<seg id="1">7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, compared to some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology genius as a great modern inventors.</seg>
<seg id="3">What Apple fans, but perhaps most revealing in the recently discovered Jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is to understand how this creative head of business processes and procedures.</seg>
<seg id="4">He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-styled Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer eager to tinker diagram - a man who believed that many business leaders, " a disease of thought, " a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">In 1995, developed Bob Cringely led the TV series " triumph of the specialist idiots ' on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs, in a rare, detailed talks.</seg>
<seg id="6">At this point in time were relegated 10 years have passed since Jobs from Apple was, and he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="7">While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.</seg>
<seg id="8">After Jobs death discovered a full VHS-copy in the garage of the director.</seg>
<seg id="9">This slightly edited footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview" this Wednesday and Thursday in the country, Mark theatre.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For someone who is well known that he loathes detailed interviews, seems jobs surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.</seg>
<seg id="11">And incredibly pensive.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the course of the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between the question and answer - Nachs 10-15 seconds, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and accuracy.</seg>
<seg id="13">There are moments in which Jobs ' impact on days when he appears impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst faster on issues or actions of greater significance.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone that seems somehow incredibly far-sighted Verlorene interview if Jobs assesses what other companies in his opinion, right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is one thing to see posthumous eulogies career jobs to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamer, is poised to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has a vision of how things could and should be.</seg>
<seg id="17">Shortly after he had it all, he drew and made it.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As he learned to run a business:</seg>
<seg id="20">" During the years in the business, I ask: " why you do things? ' and the answer, you always get is, ' Oh, it is so easy. "</seg>
<seg id="21">No one knows why he does what he is doing, no one thinks the business really carefully about things.</seg>
<seg id="22">I have noticed that.</seg>
<seg id="23">Jobs will lead to further his efforts to streamline the accounting at Apple.</seg>
<seg id="24">Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" were estimated at a mere innocence and then adapted "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which will be able to ensure that the business costs in minute.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The Pope was veralbert:</seg>
<seg id="26">Jobs told of "the Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and free long-distance calls.</seg>
<seg id="27">The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.</seg>
<seg id="28">He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, make a phone call and then by an AT & T network in another link, while so many satellites as possible by stacking.</seg>
<seg id="29">"We sent matters of half a dozen times around the globe, and if we grölte phone, there was a minute later, next door in the phone," jobs told kichernd.</seg>
<seg id="30">"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="31">Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can monitor a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jobs told from a glorious coup, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they anriefen via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to speak with the pope, while it so well, they were able to follow Henry Kissinger.</seg>
<seg id="33">Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to the telephone.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">As he is in love with the technology (and unprepared, Bill Hewlett anrief):</seg>
<seg id="35">In the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.</seg>
<seg id="36">Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part-time at Hewlett-Packard.</seg>
<seg id="37">"It was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen in age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated his staff."</seg>
<seg id="38">Later jobs, one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first Desktop computers ever produced."</seg>
<seg id="39">He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I love in him.</seg>
<seg id="40">I would climb at HP as a teenager and depend on this machine and write programs for them.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">How to improve innovation:</seg>
<seg id="42">Several times in the interview speaks jobs about spontaneously inventing new products.</seg>
<seg id="43">Early in his career when he incorporated some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.</seg>
<seg id="44">He worked with a payment period of 30 days and had to think both the assembly processes as well as the extradition of the ready-made equipment.</seg>
<seg id="45">He later Apple recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:</seg>
<seg id="46">"I remember resounding arguments... you shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."</seg>
<seg id="47">Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15, and this was incredibly credible.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">Large companies keep:</seg>
<seg id="49">Long before he left Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants in stumble with their visions and lost control of their shares.</seg>
<seg id="50">"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopier or printer, so what?"</seg>
<seg id="51">They have the monopoly shares, so the company is not successful.</seg>
<seg id="52">Sales and marketing to make it successful, so [people], which is ultimately the company and the product, the people will be pushed out of decision-making.</seg>
<seg id="53">The product genius that has led to this monopoly by people who have no concept of extinct about good products versus bad products - crafts art.</seg>
<seg id="54">It happened at Xerox...</seg>
<seg id="55">Xerox would have the entire computer industry.</seg>
<seg id="56">It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...</seg>
<seg id="57">They have caught the defeat from victory.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">On innovation, as the art form:</seg>
<seg id="59">"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if we develop this great idea, it is changing and growing."</seg>
<seg id="60">You learn a lot about its subtleties.</seg>
<seg id="61">Votes must be certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.</seg>
<seg id="62">We must see 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together...</seg>
<seg id="63">Ultimately, it comes down to taste, what you do, it is that you try with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying these things to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="64">Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.</seg>
<seg id="65">We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.</seg>
<seg id="66">Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen were historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world.</seg>
<seg id="67">It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.</seg>

</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">On the day of the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically share issue of whether a challenge to listen to the health care legislation, President Obama will gesponsort, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the law firm that represented the case before the court.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.</seg>
<seg id="4">One of the cases dealt with a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have decided last year by Congress, a law with conservative activists in the United States has become the buzzword.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">The judges agreed with the hearing; in fact, it is expected in March, a 5 1/2-hour foundations discussion, presumably the result will probably be the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time the court decision will be in full swing.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">The lawyer will stand trial and argue that to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, Prosecutor General, under the administration of George W. Bush.</seg>

<seg id="7">Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Föderalistischen society, a veteran group of defending conservative principles of law.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially involved in the outcome of the process is enormous.</seg>
<seg id="10">The dinner was held a few hours after the court had advised on the case, in a Washington hotel.</seg>
<seg id="11">Service was among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce opponent of the health-care reform</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">The guests Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.</seg>
</p>

<seg id="1">Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would go unnoticed to weaken national security, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The Pentagon is already considering cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion dollars or more will be needed if Congress can reach any conclusion in the spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.</seg>
<seg id="5">He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation would lead to 23% overall cuts, as well as a halt to many new projects.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">"Such a large cut, carried out in such a glib way would be impractical to make the most of our shipping and construction projects - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have to furlough almost certainly civilians, in order to achieve this objective."</seg>
<seg id="8">"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, " said Panetta.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">"During the war time contingents in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect the serious intrusion into the basic budget war efforts," Panetta warned.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Recruitment have been cut, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war."</seg>
<seg id="12">"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war-time traffickers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."</seg>
<seg id="15">"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"This is a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not that we should impose."</seg>
<seg id="17">"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators to increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget will strengthen or demands will exclude the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">Panetta has become increasingly outspoken, the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">At a press conference in last week's painting of the defence minister, a gloomy picture, which could face a military shell, but without the heart.</seg>
<seg id="21">"It is a ship without sailors."</seg>
<seg id="22">"It is a brigade without ammunition."</seg>
<seg id="23">"It is an Air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."</seg>
<seg id="24">"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It is a dispute, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to take it up with potential opponents."</seg>
<seg id="26">"They are really angry."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta introduced new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk of future war operations."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">And Panetta said that some of the deletion of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.</seg>
<seg id="29">This list also includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new oral Litt Combat Ship and the new ground vehicle, the Army and Navy needed to replace the Humvee.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">We would stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but supporters say that it is an important next step in the buildup, so that the possible dangers averted by China and other opponents.</seg>

<seg id="11">There have been incidents in which teachers their students test answers, so that they themselves well in their performance reviews.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mentors, who teach the opposite should send a message that lies and fudges OK.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">We are seeing how much deception?</seg>
<seg id="14">Studies show that we are lying every day between 10 and 200 times.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many of these lies, but as Notlügen.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study shows that strangers lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">To detect lies, or "lies to uncover" to learn is important for every human being, and both for personal or professional reasons.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As a result of research is that most of the old myths about the lies were exposed.</seg>

<seg id="12">The pipeline would pass through six states.</seg>

<seg id="13">Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "we said we would support this government, after all."</seg>
<seg id="14">We believe that this government is the last chance to bring Italy out of this emergency.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The Monti's chances of success have been substantially increased by the support of the party PDL Silvio Berlusconi on Saturday as a result of the crisis had to resign.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="16">"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of technocrats government, Monti is just.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Support from Parliament</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="20">Opposition to his efforts, or the delaying of the reforms could lead to a devastating attack by the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference, Monti's failure was a disaster, too.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">A bailout of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Monti said his government should be held until the next elections, expected in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians are going to give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Political sources indicate that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicates the involvement of people from political life.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">For Costa Rica's fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means for your fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">To play in Costa Rica is a dream for us.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is just the second time that we have been in South and Central America, and until now, it is great.</seg>
<seg id="12">I am only on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country, that we still have a few days to stay there.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting for us to bring our music there.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">I ask you, because the fans of the band are completely. They see our utmost attention to the days before the concert.</seg>
<seg id="15">What you are saying your enthusiastic fans?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Thank you, all these years to stand by our side.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and I have waited so long and we 're sorry to have taken so long, until we got here.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.</seg>
<seg id="19">This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Some of the greatest shows we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="21">We have played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="22">We really have the inclination to play there.</seg>
<seg id="23">We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">How do you know of Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">Many of our friend is a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamar Enhanced, where the waves are unimaginable.</seg>
<seg id="26">My friends are always driven surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are excellent places for surfing in this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">You have huge shows with many of the songs offered with an eye on the tour.</seg>
<seg id="28">You have plans for the event in Costa Rica?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Since we have never played, we also have no borders.</seg>
<seg id="30">We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and provide a good and versatile repertoire of our fans.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">It is never repeated your repertoire.</seg>
<seg id="32">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">I believe this is partly because we play nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will not be easy.</seg>
<seg id="34">If we have two or three songs that we no longer have to include in the repertoire, we will be better able to maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they have reasons to remember why these songs like they might otherwise be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="35">That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">With this tour celebrates your 20-year history.</seg>
<seg id="37">If she looks back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Yes, totally.</seg>
<seg id="39">First of all, I believe that none of us has to play in a great rock band, and for over 20 years, which is like a dream.</seg>
<seg id="40">We continue on this blessing, and it is great now to make music.</seg>
<seg id="41">We may, and are delighted to bring music.</seg>
<seg id="42">We are lucky to go to the places in the world, we have always wanted to visit again.</seg>
<seg id="43">Things could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">What it meant for you to have actively participated in the birth of Grunge?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">It is always been an honour to be part of this group of large bands.</seg>
<seg id="46">We are good friends with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.</seg>
<seg id="47">It is surprising and unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.</seg>
<seg id="48">And there is a band from a city, but it is unusual, if at the same time, five or ten groups come from the same city.</seg>
<seg id="49">We are proud and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.</seg>
<seg id="50">Sometimes we are still together.</seg>
<seg id="51">Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Sound Guards on their tour, and we are pleased to be still with all of them friends and we are honoured to be part of this emerged from Seattle-Sounds.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">It is also very unusual for a band like the exporters with the same musicians together for a long time.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Mattisen (Cameron) met 13 years ago, to us, which is already a lot more time than many bands.</seg>
<seg id="54">First of all, I believe that we are all happy to still be alive, and also we care for each other.</seg>
<seg id="55">We are all close friend why musical paths have opened every individual freedom to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="56">A familiar to the other and music could not be better.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.</seg>
<seg id="58">As she finds a balance?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.</seg>
<seg id="60">We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.</seg>
<seg id="61">Until you consider that the people who came for the music reminds you that you have the music and what it has not determined to be a famous rock star has in any case never interested.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">What you have memories of your other Motherwell Love bone?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">I think we have very good songs, and it was great to start.</seg>
<seg id="64">We were given three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record out.</seg>
<seg id="65">We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought laughter, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other issues.</seg>
<seg id="66">He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">The domestic bond desk rtas Las are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.</seg>
<seg id="68">It is true that she knows her work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have chosen for the opening?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69">Yes, the production sent us Las videos by various groups and this band liked best, and so we are curious to see what rtas wardrobe can provide live, and this will certainly exciting.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">Why does her text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71">This is an issue for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.</seg>
<seg id="72">He sings it, and I think he is singing the first thing he can think of.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="73">From whom you have got to be as influenced Bassist?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">So many +</seg>
<seg id="75">Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...</seg>
<seg id="76">There are so many that I could all afternoon on the Bassisten, which I liked.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">It has managed to Pearl Jam, to keep the Grunge alive, although it is not a fad?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="78">I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.</seg>
<seg id="79">If I think about it, the band, which I have mentioned, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, if they are still important, I think that is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.</seg>
<seg id="81">Why?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album which could counteract lightly, but there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive.</seg>
<seg id="83">I came to two tears when I heard how Ed played, they are very dark songs.</seg>
<seg id="84">I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you have a family or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs are clearly for me.</seg>
<seg id="85">But I also believe that we can make a happy person and still dark music.</seg>

<seg id="1">Parking or mountain?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees with the tender.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In the mid-1980s, the peak of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) published its Schmähschrift this administration on the promotion of Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="5">The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="6">He has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.</seg>
<seg id="7">With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in many people's eyes to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).</seg>
<seg id="8">The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Served as an example not of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.</seg>
<seg id="10">So far, it was the city in September, a tender giant, consisting of 16 competitions for further access doors Collserola.</seg>
<seg id="11">Undoubtedly a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.</seg>
<seg id="12">Either that, or somebody has to make gates to the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.</seg>
<seg id="15">It is almost a rekurrentes issue at the meeting, two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the elevator.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is precisely this fact offers a rare agreement between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.</seg>
<seg id="17">Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: tender is appropriate.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">It is necessary for Roldán ' " after the attack on the coast on the " front on mountains " to discuss the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has been on the green apples, not fought.</seg>
<seg id="19">" It should be based on the principle that the greatest mainly park is the beach.</seg>
<seg id="20">Among other things, because it is a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="21">Collserola is more complex, " judging by the architect for the title ' gates of Collserola ' " lexikalische trap ": they must not " as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Modol as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "dangers."</seg>
<seg id="23">Risks as a result of the " uncertainty, nowadays, the creation of a public space with " after the experience of the 1980s, which had been in the area of the forum, their swan song. "</seg>
<seg id="24">The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Limit always means to determine the next step," it says.</seg>
<seg id="26">"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) can lead to a real disaster."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Modol, closer to the issue, simplifies the Collserola side in the direction of Valle sana, " can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ', and for purely topographic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="28">Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not fall on deaf ears, " though he was the city administration, grateful that his body has been given the opportunity to participate in this project, " from the first moment. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Moreover, he notes that the Area near the town of escort letter, which allows the architects, to participate in the debate, even though he was giving his " doubt " whether this technical profile, which created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, " he says), ' we architects should be a tool. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Bayona suggests that the answer to the question of complex in the title of the article was tendered in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacks: "there have been 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis of mountains sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."</seg>
<seg id="31">He has, at least in his case that the 16 competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.</seg>
<seg id="33">In his view, the city should guarantee that the Strip directly via the Ronda de Dalt equipped in all its length is a soft transition between town and green zones.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="5">This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).</seg>

<p>
<seg id="13">Cruz López stressed that the investigation would be carried out at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">"The health surveys showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77% and girls with obesity 47% increase from 1999 and 2006, and the obesity has risen dramatically," the expert said of the IMSS.</seg>

<seg id="1">Asphalt prevented the UNAM potholes</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry in the Mexican University UNAM developed with Polymeren modified asphalt, in order to make the mixture resilient to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">That would avoid the sign by the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary, almost 200000 potholes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (town area of the valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of the Asphaltbelags adequately happen, the number of potholes to significantly reduce or even fully.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In his lecture, "potholes from a technical point of view," he felt during the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible Polymeren modified asphalt is developing a similar asphalt mix, but a major mechanical resistance in both high as low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt in areas with extremely hot climate, such as, for example, in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of the oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together they give the road surface to be typical zähelastisches behavior.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">Zähelastisches behavior Asphalts means that this is behaving at high temperatures of nearly 180 degrees as a liquid, it is very zähflüssig 120 degrees and 50 degrees almost, while he is crumbling at very low temperatures.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not a uniform, but in a day, depending on the changing weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">The researchers said the FQ, the streets of Mexico City have been mostly a flexible road surface from six layers of material, which included the last three asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="10">Between the upper classes is a layer of decay from asphalt from small, profusely in asphalt and entrenched stones.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">Each individual piece, this decay, was profusely in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="12">If the vehicles to move and forces produced this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.</seg>
<seg id="13">"If it would be modified asphalt, the forces would be even better," said the chemical engineer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">" The erosion, " he said, " will be interpreted in a final layer of the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, was also in asphalt.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since these shifts in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need more mechanical than the class decay and friction.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">The road surface which receives most of the forces and distributed Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it needs to be maintained.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are more important to take into account factors, especially the water, "he said," because it affects the behavior of the class decay.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">If the terrain is damp, water in the class and only difficult from this causes a relaxation of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of stroke holes.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">If a pothole, " he said, " first-class deck dismantled brick-by-brick, while the class wear only affected, but the damage is not immediately, but it is a process that should be the first sign by adequate maintenance programs maintained. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Mexico's research system) declared that the burden of the vehicle, another important reason for the emergence of blow holes so the thickness of each layer of the surface always stand in relation to the vehicle and it must be ensured that to prevent frequent blow holes this rule will be met.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">Rafael Herrera has pointed out that there is still much research to wait, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries are already on the market, and the potholes and repair the application of high temperatures.</seg>

<seg id="9">The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the jury, to appoint the first failure, is that it has the answer to the question "what books you most and why?" She asked the Carreta litre Arias Leamos of Martín Murillo Gómez was not convinced.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:</seg>
<seg id="11">" I read a lot, I believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of civilizing, ultimately, I believe that the book for my childhood shaped hardest, ' The small prince ' is a very deep book.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement. " It is a book of universal culture, we should all read, I read a book by Irene Nemirovski a Russian girl, a beautiful book that says ' passions.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">An answer to, firstly, because of the concept of ' civilised ' and, secondly, because she had not explained how each called her book influenced them.</seg>
<seg id="14">But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result, " the universe is wise, it is what needs to be done.</seg>
<seg id="15">And for all people: please read a little bit of ' The small prince '; it is a great book.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Among other things, it is said that the favorite out of El Valle.</seg>
<seg id="17">A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was favouring the stresste all Beifälle reaps and in the run-up to all get prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte suit and Reina Madre), "the other candidates possessive had made what the Queen, who is not on the stage to shine."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach, the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although they were both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme " como en casa ' Channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, " shows that the candidate wins during the competition, most prices eventually will not be queen. "</seg>
<seg id="21">Moreover, Valle was at the end of the press from the road - a mistake.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what is the essence of the national beauty contest.</seg>
<seg id="23">It will have a reason that two days before the international jury " Lucy Doughty said it sought a woman for the social affairs of their country.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they are already participating in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, she said in the stomach area had sinned, but this is contradictory, because it gave the jury as a candidate for natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The coach of the king, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, for me, frankly, hard to say, their score on the last day."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Meanwhile, the journalist is Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.</seg>
<seg id="28">" The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should make it right.</seg>
<seg id="29">Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">Because of this prize, which will be the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing costume cruel forecasting, which should be true in the night, it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they do not benefit from the crown.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">Regardless of whether that is true or not, it is a fact that Melina today their governing year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position which provides the opportunity to appoint the national beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, it will be one of the queens, despite their overwhelming outburst for Cartagena escaped injury, was to go down in history.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">However, when he reached with the investigation, the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.</seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">"The walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprints, but in this case, we were able to identify the imprint of the whole and the offender in several thefts took part," he remembered.</seg>

<p>
<seg id="27">With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be exonerated or tainted.</seg>

<seg id="1">What represents the Krank fraud stories?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">After the family aid UMP and the government to take the Krank in attack.</seg>
<seg id="3">Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family of aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007, always recurrent - subject of the fight against social and economic dependence on the state.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">In order to accompany this attack by the desire to undergo the economy in a tough test, but on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate workers sick.</seg>
<seg id="5">First of all with economic budget targets: the government reshape the introduction of a fourth-day leave before a speech Krank workers in the private sector.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company wage would lose by four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.</seg>
<seg id="7">A measure which, according to the newspaper, "les echoes" threatens to provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="8">The other measure with a rather symbolic nature accompanied: state officials unvergüteten waiting in the event of illness (so far, there is for them, Gegensatze three days waiting in the private sector, no waiting period).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">While these issues in the debate, sparked by the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse associated with labour shortage.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Checks will be much more important and, moreover, they are rückzuvergüten, if it is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, before the microphone of the station RTL.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">As in other cases, seem to the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krank reports a little disproportionate.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is, in fact, since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations, the most frequently borne fruit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">We dwell, however, the nationwide figures.</seg>
<seg id="15">According to the country's health insurance fund CNAM more than EUR 237 million daily compensation paid in 2006.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of health care, the daily compensation with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health expenditure in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="17">Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and illness leave on 54%, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.</seg>
<seg id="18">And, therefore, 2.5% of health spending.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">In 2010, have been given to the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.</seg>
<seg id="20">Midway, covered up the differences: a different monster twitter.com, Web site for career planning, was published in 2007, showed that 75% of 40,000 claimed that French workers have taken a single hospital.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">A different, this time covered by the health insurance study clarifies that 37% of the Krank reports of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% in 2010.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend to not more than elsewhere, to work.</seg>
<seg id="23">A global shortage in 2010, by two researchers from the French state-owned Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) carried out long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the fragmented rate (or otherwise) oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">The Krank fraud reports represents a tiny share in terms of undeclared work.</seg>
<seg id="25">Regarding the fraud is only a weak levels.</seg>
<seg id="26">Encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that there is systmatische controls Krank reports exceed 45 days.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285000 carried short-term Krank reports in 37050 cases "unjustified or too long."</seg>
<seg id="28">The systematic controlled Krankmeldungsfällen of more than 45 days was permanently under 1.2 million, 11% "aligned or unjustified" cases, which means 132000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">Overall, this makes so 169000 "unjustified" to several million workers who have a Krank notification.</seg>
<seg id="30">A paragraph, only a weak number, for example, the undeclared work represents.</seg>
<seg id="31">According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July, is between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, more than the total cost of daily expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in latter regarding this issue.</seg>

<seg id="1">Euthanasia and accompanied Freitod must be legalised, a panel of experts</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together for the best pain relief funds, and also about the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">The Canadian society is living in a attitude towards the death.</seg>
<seg id="5">Only 9% of Canadians can, in fact, with their doctor to talk about the conditions under which they wish to die and make provisions for this purpose.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, were involved in the six experts in various fields, among other things, ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.</seg>
<seg id="7">This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law, so in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and patients are seen as able to make such a decision.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">As a prelude to quote the experts, a recent poll published by the independent EIU society, the quality of death compared with each other in 40 countries around the globe.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although Canada has placed on the 10th, the study noted that "the medical care of euthanasia in Canada has a culture in which people are afraid to touch on the subject of death."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, tell us the appointed experts from the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
<seg id="11">And despite the wish of the majority of Canadians to die at home, however, will die 68.6% of those in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="12">The whole country is considered the rate with 86% occurred in hospital deaths in Quebec.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">In the delicate question about euthanasia and accompanying Etem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions, the position of the federal government, which has already expressed a wish to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying Etem suicide counter.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">But there is now, according to the experts, who also inspected all those countries whose approach legalised euthanasia and assisted suicide or decriminalising have no proof that such a decriminalisation of abuses in its application, the practice of euthanasia or accompanying Etem suicide of unkompetenten or not consenting individuals.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the contrary, we meet far more cases of such violations in the countries in which euthanasia and accompany suicide are not, as yesterday, Jocelyn Downie, a co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">"Euthanasia is in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."</seg>
<seg id="17">"It will also accompany suicide in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Canadians support euthanasia</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">We have to say that, according to an Angus Reid poll, already 85% of the Canadians in favour of euthanasia had expressed in 2010, as they are of the opinion that allow people at the end of her life path to alleviate their suffering.</seg>
<seg id="20">And 66% believe that the issue of euthanasia did not mean to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value.</seg>
<seg id="21">In terms of people who have already assisted suicide, the respondents represented 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">What maintenance or suspension of patients, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.</seg>
<seg id="23">Similarly, this should be in their recommendation list suggests that the criminal law indicated that cancelling the resources for a legal rejection, not as a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="24">The panel of experts also calls for health care professionals should be trained in the task of cancelling the funds to respect life without fear of criminal prosecution.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">The panel said that governments, institutions, health care and doctors about schmerzlindernder treatment worked together to provide the best pain relief funds, and also about the cases of cancer.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">The panel calls on the far-reaching health care in the Canadian institutions used to pain relief or final measures, at least to consider, because this little euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and those related to the same procedure.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">Other reservations experts</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">Some experts in the field of law of health care have reservations about the conclusions of the report, experts from the Royal Society of Canada.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, the attitude of the undersigned report experts described as "extreme," among other things, as these euthanasia practice in the final stages of any borders.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">"This opens the doors for a situation in which anyone tired of life and is older than 18 years, to ask another person, he had seen in his suicide to help," RA Deschamps yesterday a summary of the report.</seg>
<seg id="31">RA Deschamps also emphasised to the authors of the report seemed the responsibility of the individual over all other values, which are involved in the social Gewirke society.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">But now, he says, there are guidelines and obligations in a society. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">Margaret Somerville, specializing in health law, also has "strong resistance" to the conclusions of the report expressed it as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto titulierte."</seg>
<seg id="34">Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, in particular, questioned the report's claims on the freedom of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and accompanied suicide, such as in the Netherlands and in Oregon.</seg>

<seg id="2">The facts should prevail over dogma</seg>

<p>
<seg id="3">There is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, so this is certainly the energy policy.</seg>
<seg id="4">The availability and cost of electricity directly in the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is reasonable to take a choice for a reason to reflect on this issue and the position of nuclear energy.</seg>
<seg id="6">The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.</seg>
<seg id="7">The French should sound their opinion on objective facts, rational data.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">Although 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution, a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, should not have a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, we must mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget in order to fight against climatic irregularities.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, blebt Germany remains isolated in his decision to abandon nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not the case in Belgium, which imposes its decision, the need to find a replacement capable replacement source in Switzerland, which barely intends only to build nuclear power plants in the past generation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States have decided after Fukushima, to rejoin her park another unit, set aside after the nuclear accident plant Three Mile Island again in operation.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if it focused on renewable energy sources, occasionally German model is portrayed as a model, but the reality of the discourse.</seg>
<seg id="16">The election in Berlin, in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, enhanced by the increased use of Importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, a rise caused by gas and coal-fired power stations in CO2 emissions.</seg>
<seg id="17">These unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.</seg>
<seg id="19">Denmark is a European leader tables in terms of wind energy, 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; because of its CO2 Ausstösse and electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.</seg>
<seg id="20">Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay higher electricity bills, in contrast to our French households by 40%.</seg>
<seg id="21">As the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key part of the ability to compete and a deposit of stability to the industry at national soil, the French company due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="22">Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which liesse the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of the illusion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Polls showed that a price that leaves the vast majority of French people, nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Let us remind ourselves that the energy policies of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410000-led jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">Because of their strong export character brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and creators of countless jobs.</seg>
<seg id="26">France should take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs are victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.</seg>
<seg id="27">What electricians would designed EPR work at 60 years if the decline is a recipe for his producers?</seg>
<seg id="28">In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that there is not a work of the devil, a miracle cure for the production of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="30">To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power, an absolute imperative.</seg>
<seg id="31">In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as construction in Flamanville.</seg>
<seg id="32">Working teams due to their professionalism have made a name, are just obsessed with security.</seg>
<seg id="33">Within 50 years of nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only a single, and occurred at Three Mile Island is under normal operating conditions; it passed without consequences for humans and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="35">Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.</seg>
<seg id="36">In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two unprecedented scale natural disasters caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.</seg>
<seg id="37">The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft, which would enable resilience to such phenomena.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because it is considered among the electrical engineers than desirable to build a nuclear power plant to be turned, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein liesse leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber debate, defined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.</seg>

<seg id="1">Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy, this policy of reconciliation with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had itself.</seg>
<seg id="3">Recently, the official side against foreign students targeted harassment of the weeks, the Interior Minister had in passing (see Libération announced on 23 May) that France "no talent, masons or waitresses needed from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="4">But this policy was only rarely, from an economic point of view.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">There is a wide consensus between left and right on this issue.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tone of Jacques Chirac has been dented by right-wing side, in 1976, had declared that "900000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be" left-wing side by Michel Rocard, in 1990, France "could not take the whole world poverty."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">The only difference is the level of generosity</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">The fear of invasion of national land by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 by both the right and the left.</seg>
<seg id="9">Both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.</seg>
<seg id="10">The only difference is the extent to which the generosity, the immigrants are willing to admit.</seg>
<seg id="11">Francois Hollande is limited in his programme banalities, pointing to a partnership venture development to solve our problems of migration. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, it may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.</seg>
<seg id="13">As we remember the economic expert Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that the latest findings on the immigration brings together (Exceptional People: how migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), among the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.</seg>
<seg id="14">Restricting immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to find substitutes for the local workforce, particularly the less skilled, they exerted pressure on their wages.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, experience shows that immigrants are much complementary truth as the domestic wage workers, because they focus on careers in sectors that are technically unutilised workplace.</seg>
<seg id="17">The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that little domestic wage workers poking the better work among the immigrants in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">Positive wage effect</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants moving on wages and domestic labour market situation.</seg>
<seg id="20">Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants, a wateringdown, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.</seg>
<seg id="21">And without taking into account the fact that the high proportion of immigrants sponsored diversity of ideas creation and economic growth is conducive to (naturalised immigrants with American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">The migrants also net social systems in European countries, on average, in a level of 1% of the total budget.</seg>
<seg id="23">The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a migrating to Germany at the age of 30 years, the person the public budget, on average, about his life, a net contribution (revenue minus spending) of the EUR 150000.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of average points "with the teeth."</seg>
<seg id="25">With these teeth, which should discourage immigrants, however, is exactly the opposite effect.</seg>

<seg id="3">A crisis weakened America can be a complex world with simple, not to say: silly ideas?</seg>
<seg id="4">If the Republican presidential candidates, listening to the voters could almost get that impression.</seg>

<seg id="1">Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe connects directly with Russia, has been put into operation.</seg>
<seg id="3">It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Russia's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to celebrate this event with great pomp and ceremony.</seg>
<seg id="5">More than 500 charged guests, including four heads of state and government have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany directly below sea level.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Angelika German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have jointly symbolic tax turned the valves, which Russian gas is transported into the Western European network.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which connects the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.</seg>
<seg id="8">A second pipeline, which is a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allowing completed at the end of 2012.</seg>
<seg id="9">And the possibility of building a third pipeline hinted on themselves.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">For Gazprom, the timely and accurate point completion of this enormous framework to provide as a victory.</seg>
<seg id="11">The project was strongly contested in Poland and the Baltic states.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany and avoid any track progress by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.</seg>
<seg id="13">For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.</seg>
<seg id="14">Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a new Franco-German sowietischen pact " in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.</seg>
<seg id="15">This means that the issue is politically sensitive.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project, a higher security of supply.</seg>
<seg id="17">It has, however, at the expense of enfeeblement of European energy, since the project was a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="18">Russia has brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, he pointed out in the extent to which the major contracts are important political and economic side.</seg>
<seg id="20">All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom's managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.</seg>
<seg id="22">The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter they protect against ship berth.</seg>
<seg id="23">It rests on the seabed, about 200 metres in depth.</seg>
<seg id="24">Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Hundreds of mines, for example, had to be a precaution, removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition to enhanced measures will be taken to protect the fauna and flora.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">The management is a long queue of metal as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, maintenance stations.</seg>
<seg id="28">A control platform was taken off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained because Sweden were hardly eager to see a Russian state company in a permanent way to its shores.</seg>
<seg id="29">"In the event of an accident, we close the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.</seg>
<seg id="30">Escape in the event of a leak in the pipeline, so depressed gas into the air.</seg>
<seg id="31">This case will probably be considered by the designers, however, because the proximity of sweat, estimated at a consistency from a leak per 100000 years.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">The state surveillance of the pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater-robot, controlled by a ship from external virtue purposes, as well as a device which circulates inside the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="33">It has the form of a cigar, a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="34">After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.</seg>
<seg id="35">The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without the slightest repairs need to be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Gaszirkulation will simply pressure.</seg>
<seg id="37">This 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">Five companies have united their forces on the implementation of this project.</seg>
<seg id="39">The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.</seg>
<seg id="40">Furthermore, the German companies incorporated E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez (to 9%).</seg>
<seg id="41">These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream and entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.</seg>
<seg id="42">It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.</seg>
<seg id="43">Gazprom has this society hired out the entire capacity of its gas, and renewable 20-year contract.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real transporting a quantity of gas," Jens Müller clarified.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and 70% covered by bank loans.</seg>
<seg id="46">The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="47">The total investment, for example, 240 million for GDF Suez.</seg>
<seg id="48">The minority shareholders are, however, certainly, to recoup their expenses because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">The pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.</seg>
<seg id="50">The 4.5-meter-high valves are Gasaustrittspforte.</seg>
<seg id="51">Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of arriving gas before this passed in the German gas pipelines.</seg>
<seg id="52">Since last Tuesday, this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour pass.</seg>
<seg id="53">At full capacity, it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers in such a high level?</seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2">About 19% of disabled people in search of a job.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today begins the 15th week of work for disabled people. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">Despite a purposeful public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate is always disabled people twice as high as the average value: 19% against Arbeitlosigkeit 9% of the total population.</seg>
<seg id="5">Discouraging?</seg>
<seg id="6">"No, Éric stressed Blanchet, Director-General of the Association of Adapt, the organiser of the week's work for the disabled."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Within 15 years of progress."</seg>
<seg id="8">"The unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">However, it must be said that, for disabled unemployed continues, there are many obstacles before they get a job.</seg>
<seg id="11">More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).</seg>
<seg id="12">They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no baccalaureate and there are only 10000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with qualifications.</seg>
<seg id="13">Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% of the disabled persons to 38% in the overall average.</seg>
<seg id="14">In short, there are so many criteria, a fresh start working, and the "heart of the problem," Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, a 1992 association set up to recruit businesses to help disabled workers.</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">So much for the brakes.</seg>
<seg id="16">The underlying implication, mentalities, certainly, but slowly.</seg>
<seg id="17">A weak note in April by the Association of IMS-Entre prendre for the magazine La Cité study gave the surveyed managers have " a level of disabled people, " which was " represented " by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off. "</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go before the employment target of 6% disabled people employed in a 1987 law was written.</seg>
<seg id="19">The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.</seg>
<seg id="20">"We are now at 3%," reported Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is mandated to raise contributions from companies that this law.</seg>
<seg id="21">The proof: "pay fees" plants has been reduced as well as the amount of contributions between 2007 and 2011, and numbers of 59000 to 46000 (606 to 480 million euros).</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">"The law of 2005, which increases, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."</seg>
<seg id="23">"But this improvement also brings a real insight, particularly in the large groups of companies."</seg>
<seg id="24">According to the Ministry for work only 59% of plants between 20 and 49, disabled staff employed, companies with 100-199 staff against 82%.</seg>
