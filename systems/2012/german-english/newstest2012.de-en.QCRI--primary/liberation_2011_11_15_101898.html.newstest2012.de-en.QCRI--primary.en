Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that is not on the basis of short-term considerations or cannot be treated as a result of emotions, so this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect Maβe purchasing power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is reasonable, a choice for a reason to take on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options explored.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational fundieren data.
Although 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by the year 2050, is not a very large share of the world's population at a crucial element.
At the same time you have to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to be able to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate verschwundenes subject to forget to fight against climate Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision on nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which his decision the need, a substitution capable replacement source, even in Switzerland, which barely intends to only nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Groβbritannien, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few states, but their projects continue to pursue with determination.
The United States has decided, after Fukushima, their parking another unit, confirmed by the nuclear accident at the Three Mile Island plant deactivated again.
Even if it focused on renewable energy sources, German model is sometimes portrayed as a model, but the reality is the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, due to the increased use of Importgas enhanced energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in the gas and coal-fired power stations-induced CO2 emissions.
All of this unpleasant effects are already being felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is a cause for reflection.
Denmark is one European tables leader in wind energy, from the 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, in turn used with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 Ausstösse and each of its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French households by 40% higher electricity bills.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy has a key role of competitiveness and a stability deposit the industry on national soil, the French companies because of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in energy prices, which the noble statements about the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power to be illusion liesse.
Polls showed that the price is the very broad majority of French nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us that energy policy of our country has made it possible for an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 inferred jobs.
Because of its strong export nature makes it a host of specialized small and medium-sized companies on the international markets and makes them to creators of jobs.
France should the decision to get out of nuclear power, which a Groβteil fall victim to this small, and the annual 6 billion euros of investment goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more together.
The electricians would work at the sixty years designed EPR, if the decline of its producers is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation we must acknowledge that it just as a devil a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
The company Areva advanced, low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy is proof of the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible level of security to maintain for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams who made a name for their professionalism, from the safety position just obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry three serious incidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, is under normal operating conditions; he was without consequences for people and the environment.
It was the tragedy of Chernobyl reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident of two natural disasters caused unprecedented drawn, which caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will also draw lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperative security authorities of the French and German operator and designers of nuclear power plants, a draft of the EPR, his resilience to such phenomena.
Because it is seen as a desirable electric technicians, to build a nuclear power plant, there would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein liesse, the leading position in the inevitable nuclear power development reissen itself.
It is essential and legitimate, after the best Energiebouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber dominate a debate, as well as economic, social and financial situation in our country considerations.
