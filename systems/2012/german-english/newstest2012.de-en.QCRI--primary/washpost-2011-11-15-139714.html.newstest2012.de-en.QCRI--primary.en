Mission ended, Congress prepared to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks as if Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and death of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and ending the American interference.
On Thursday approved the Committee for international relations of the Senate, a resolution the Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), and Libya for the successful rebellion and the American troops for their "courage" praises.
"This resolution is a tribute to the courageous people of Libya, with the reconstruction of their country have begun," said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer arguing lawmakers of both parties and the White House over the wording of a number of resolutions for approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya mission to NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain, a resolution before the limited use of military force in Libya, the United States.
The law has been in the Senate by a wide fringe of both parties rejected and there was no vote.
But on the same day fell by this bill in the Senate and the House voted on a decision to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
As a result, the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that was raised enough, Obama's approach in the context of the mission to criticise, but not angry enough to him finally pull the rug from under our feet.
Then the indecision of Congress has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell in August by the Libyan rebels and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be willing to take action.
The resolution of the Committee for international relations "congratulates the people of Libya on her enormous courage and exceptional perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and its coalition partners, the military operations to protect the people of Libya support for their exceptional courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirmed "the national interests of the United States to a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
The new measures will have the full support of the committee on foreign relations or they will divide the legislator, as the law in June?
The final version is on the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican on the committee.
Lugars spokesman said on Monday that it has the final version of the new law have not yet seen.
According to the Capitol, the Senate this week to vote on a constitutional amendment, which calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term, the Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, under the leadership of the Republican Bob good bar (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other sector, which at the time of the vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes that have been submitted to Congress and a whole range of issues.
Some are twice - the same law was both the Congress and the Senate - others are slightly different.
There are only in the Senate at least 15 versions of Ausgleichshaushaltsänderung and another dozen, "federal spending control".
Some of the laws are identical, but they give their customers - particularly rookie among Republicans who want to burnish their CV - the possibility to bluster that such a measure "written".
The Haushaltskontrollgesetz, which was adopted in August, requires that both Senate and Congress on a change to balancing the budget vote.
In March, 58 senators for a non-binding resolution, which supports the idea of such a change.
On the budget, some members want the number of provisions that members of Congress can present limit, while the Republicans José E. Serrano (New York) the limit of two terms of office of the president wants to lift.
The Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes, including the right to a good education and health care.
An amendment that bans on same-sex marriage, as well as an amendment that prohibits the burning of flags, a recurring documents.
Some lawmakers also want the lifting of federal laws, if two-thirds of the states that reject.
So assiduously, as members suggest changes, so far as they move faster in recent years.
In 111. Congress, lawmakers 77 such changes in 110 vor.. Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, in which more than 150 members regularly changes every two years, so the figures, which the Senate library available.
But they were not much more successful than today's.
The last amendment, which is to say, 27, was ratified in 1992, but was already proposed to Congress in 1789.
