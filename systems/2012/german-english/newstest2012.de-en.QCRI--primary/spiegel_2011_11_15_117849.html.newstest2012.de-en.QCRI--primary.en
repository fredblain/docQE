21er house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: The Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels, prices in 1958, was at the museum in Vienna, was empty and verkam.
Now he opened an exhibition House.
If modern postwar architecture geschwärmt is clear forms, glass halls, courageous Schwüngen and new building materials that are typical of the faith to technical progress is the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a good and well-known example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time was the Eurovision Song Contest Architecture for his easy float along steel-and-glass-design.
The construction is up today as a landmark contemporary architecture.
He made it known that the architects of the next World Expo pavilion built in Austria.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem Nebenbau in Munich in 1973, he was internationally famous.
His as a temporary exhibition planned pavilion was built after the World exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, in 1962 and converted to open a museum of the 20th century, "the 1920s house" it was called.
But the building was not suitable space and technically as museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used for so long, and the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now, the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he is now "21er House" and will in future be used as a museum of contemporary art.
The Belvedere museum opened Tuesday night at the house, where the first exhibition - a stroke of luck.
The fresh start has prevailed Agnes Husslein-Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, permitted by art historian with considerable career including youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and the founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting to politicians and Denkmalschützern, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship money and put to use.
No contemporary art, the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous Foundation, a café and a book shop, and it should be an office had to be built to house.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was the ideal Krischanitz occupation.
Not only because it in Vienna Secession Joseph Olbrichs sensitively converted and expanded and won the competition, but because he Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna has studied and the pavilion for him an "incredibly important place" was that he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which has been in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
The current restructuring, there were far greater problems: The building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glass fibre reinforced Isolierglas and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Bridges cold-steel makers are increasingly or replaced, refurbished and asbestos blankets were filled.
Two sub-shells room for the new use, a abgesenkter light gap between House and street provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer-pavilion.
The original external doors have remained, the House is in the old rotbraunen rust-protection-Farbton removed.
And the cinema is even more exactly as it once was.
And all of this under strict supervision of the memorial authority and with a small budget.
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in Untergeschoss.
Despite all the constraints, problems and repairing the building is flexible and easily.
It would have been difficult with the pavilion, "from Brussels than usual," Krischanitz has recently said that a typical "early-in-the-City history."
Such a structure would "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21er House but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban fortune happened: The Swiss around the garden is completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings.
And another stroke of luck may still happen: The 21er House could increase by another Krischanitz-construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg, the Berlin Temporäre art hall bought, and we hear, they have negotiated with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
