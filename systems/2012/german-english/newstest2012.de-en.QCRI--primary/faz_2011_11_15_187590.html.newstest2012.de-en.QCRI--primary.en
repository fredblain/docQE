The threat is real
After the discovery of "Zwickauer cell" doubt Turkish media on German state of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology," which now auflebe again.
The killings of eight türkischstämmigen and a Greek small entrepreneurs in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extreme right-wing background.
On this news will be in Turkey and in the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and anxiety.
Because for many German-Turks go back a long totgeglaubtes ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no similar violence with extreme right-wing background more against Turks.
In Germany, xenophobia, but was never in question.
The right-wing extremist network is revealed, however, proportions, whose dimension is still far from clear.
"Live on the bloody ideology?" Was the headline in the online edition of the Turkish newspaper, "Haber Turk."
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, said that one of the perpetrators of a V-man of constitutional protection should have been, and is concerned that German authorities in the extreme right-wing swamp might be involved.
Germany's Turkish community responded calmly: They reminded over the weekend with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate to the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish Anwerbeabkommens.
In happy colours was the co-existence has been staged as a history of success.
As a slap in the face, as the reporting of some Turkish media: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform, "Haber X," of the background of the series of murders speaking.
The German edition of 'Hürriyet' does not take these ideas together.
"It is beginning to stink," is the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people had been killed, the taxes paid and their work is an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had done.
Is extremely critical in German-Turkish internet forums, the actions of the police investigation and their later success.
Why the German authorities do not have much more was learned, in extreme right-wing circles after suspects to surprise the authors.
Some shows to drastic measures prepared at least rhetorically: "Will continue to be a sloppy approach here, the migrants do nothing other than self-defence and the armed forces."
"This is probably the best self-protection."
"The quality of education and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," writes "selenium."
What it means when the inner peace in Germany is in danger, shows up the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply embedded in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance in right-wing violence can lead.
But the attacks schärften the We-feeling on the Turkish side.
Not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was, above all, the failure of the German policy after the attacks highlighted the fact: Helmut Kohl, who refused to visit survivors of Mölln.
After the fire attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, was at the funeral in Cologne, but of his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Kinkel was back in his speech on how many charges the local Turks.
As the value of a human berechne after the level of its tax deductions.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep distrust of many German Turks in the domestic law since then.
In addition to the efforts of a comprehensive education and re-evaluation of the extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany needs this time open words.
