What was the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that this sector that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia did not.
El Valle receives his 14th Miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the award of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied with the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, expelling them as new Miss Colombia, on the show.
With the result that night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar in itself, it's Department is already at 14 Miss title and Melina is required by the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, almost in the hands of the crown. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question today, many are asking is what was missing?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a big favorite in every projection had shown that they had all the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing the Queen of the police and the Rostro Jolie of vogue Mejor elected titles, including the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received, and the crown of Miss Colombia took home.
The first factor, as it applies to the decision of the jury, they failed to appoint the first is that the answer to the question "What book has the most impact on you and why?" She of Martín Gómez Carreta Literaria Leamos by Murillo was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca the author replied:
"I read a lot, I think quite to the literature, I believe it is a kind of become more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book, which for most shaped my childhood," The small Prince 'is a very deep book.
At the moment, I read "crime and Punishment ', it is a book of universal culture that we all should read: I read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book that' passion 'means.
One answer, which met with skepticism, firstly because of the term 'more civilised' and, secondly, because it does not specifically said how each of them had influenced their 'book.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, calm and to feel happy with the outcome, "the universe is wise, it happens, what needs to be done.
And for all people: Please read a bit of 'The small Prince', it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favourite of El Valle ausgebrannt.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, all Beifälle einheimste and in the run-up to all prices was given (gastronomy competition Oster, audience vote on the best handgeschneiderte matches and Reina Madre), "jealous of the other candidates had made what the Queen stresste, therefore not shine on the stage."
As we noted in its first presentation in the bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and its two lifts in the coronation ceremony.
Although they both appeared safe, it lacked the strength and the impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico display.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "como en casa 'in RCN Channel said that the fact that Melina was crowned the Miss," shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, but not Queen. "
In addition, Valle at the end of the press from the road - an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, which ultimately could not persuade the essence of the National beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were a woman for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is enough for a Miss Colombia. We must look beyond the physical and social sense, insist that they even before the participation in the competition had worked on projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with its defects of Derriere and fibrosis, her in the stomach area noted, had sinned. But this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina not the best body that it better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, which for me, to be honest, hard to say was, put their point number on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca had the surgery, which they had been subjected to.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should let them correctly.
Her body has never been their strong side, and this point she had to pay. "
Because of this prize, for the first time by the National beauty contest that arose after the appearance in bathing suit a cruel prediction in the night should be true. It was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, so they do not enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their rule year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that it offers the possibility of appointing the National beauty contest Colombia in international competitions.
However, it will be one of the queens, despite its overwhelming outburst of Cartagena escaped the crown was to go down in history.
