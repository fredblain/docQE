Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people to find a job.
Today, "the 15th week of work for the disabled."
Despite a determined public policy, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people always twice the average middle value: Arbeitlosigkeit 19% to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, Éric said Blanchet, director-general of the Association of Adapt" week of work for the disabled "liberal."
"The progress made within 15 years."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to do."
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed still many obstacles remain before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 disabled under the 2.3 million students with higher education qualifications.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult for a new work a rose, and the "heart of the problem is," Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The underlying implication, the spirit of attitudes, certainly, but slow to develop.
One in April by the Association of IMS-entreprendre et for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak knowledge levels on the disabled," the "over-represented" was "of people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually less well-off."
Result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which enshrined in an Act of 1987,.
The latter, originating from the 2008 figures point to a ratios of 2.6%.
"We are now in the 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director-General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is charged with recovering contributions from companies that violate the law.
The evidence: The number "fees zahlender" plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and from 59,000 zahlenmäβig at 46,000 (and on 606 to 480 million euros).
"This Act of 2005, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the company, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real insight, especially the groβen firms groups."
According to the Department for Work employ only 59% of establishments between 20 and 49 employees disabled workers, companies with 100 to 199 employees against 82%.
