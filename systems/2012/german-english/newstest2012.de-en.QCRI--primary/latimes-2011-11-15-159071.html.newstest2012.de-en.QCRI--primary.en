The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently their bid for the Office of the Governor of Muchoacan lost during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday, drug dealers had the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, the race for the governor's office in the western state won.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral processes and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our colleagues in the polls... you have occupied polling booths, road blockades constructed... and people responsible [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.

Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise the winner Vallejo.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party PRD, which currently acting governor, was ranked Three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the presidential election in 2012.
Also Aureoles refused to recognize the provisional results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels to marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
