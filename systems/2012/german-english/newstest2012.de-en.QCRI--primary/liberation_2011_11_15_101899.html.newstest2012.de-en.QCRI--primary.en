Is immigration burden or opportunity for the economy?
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised for a number of points, police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures that have undergone a policy of reconciliation of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France itself was heading.
Recently, the anti-harassment of official foreign students look at the weekend, the Home Secretary had a passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that France "no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad was necessary."
But this policy was rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
On this issue, there is a wide consensus between right and left.
The tone of right-wing side has been dented by Jacques Chirac, the 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be," from left-wing side by Michel Rocard, 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the level of Groβzügigkeit
The fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumber was in 2005 on both the right and the left.
From both camps were immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent to which the Groβzügigkeit, the immigrants is willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme to banalities, say, partnership development will allow it, our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem that could potentially have an impact on the election; but it is economically costly.
As the economy Ian Goldin, Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book, the latest findings on the immigration together (exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press; 352 S.), there is a broad consensus among the experts about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limit immigration would weaken growth and the labour market situation.
Fears over the impact of the migrants are based on the idea that these threats, the local workforce, particularly the less qualified, to be replaced by pressure exerted on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that the immigrants in reality much complementary than when the local wage workers, since they schwerpunktmäβig jobs in sectors that are technically unausgelastet job.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors, the local wage workers little comment, the better among immigrants working in dynamic sectors where the training is not the labour supply converged.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon difficulties would have to work in a country where there is a shortage of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between natives and immigrants have a positive effect of Einwandererzuzugs on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni peri in this way has calculated that a 1% disabled rising flood of immigrants a miteinbezogene, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% only.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward the immigrants creation and economic growth is conducive (high proportion eingebürgerter immigrants under American Nobel laureates, Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Net migrants also contribute to the social systems, in European countries, for example, on average, for a total of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that at the age of 30 years after Germany einwandernde person the public budget on average about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenses) of about 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of disciplinary issues "with the teeth."
They said teeth, which should deter immigrants, however, reached exactly the opposite effect.
