Asphalt of the UNAM prevented blow holes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte resilient to the mix of weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would the signs that the effective, respected, it would not be necessary, nearly 200,000 blow holes to repair when the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying and maintenance of Asphaltbelags if appropriate, the number of blow holes significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his presentation "blow holes from a technical point of view," he to mark the International Year of Chemistry, he was aware that the laboratory, for which he is responsible, with Polymeren modified Asphalte developing similar to the asphalt mix, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and the incidence of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt, the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, part of which has a high Molekulargewicht - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part is a low - the so-called Malthene together, they give the effective his typical zähelastisches behavior.
Zähelastisches behaviour of Asphalts means that this is at high temperatures of nearly 180 ° C as a liquid, at 120 ° C, it is very tough liquid and nearly 50 ° C, while he is fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resilience of the Asphalts on the streets is not uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations changes," led the chemical engineer.
The researchers the FQ said, the streets of Mexico City had a flexible effective by a majority of six material classes together, of which the last three asphalt.
Among the top layers would wear a layer of asphalt from small, asphalt gebadeten there and then entrenched stones.
Each piece this decay class, whether in asphalt gebadet.
If the vehicles travel and forces that produced this class provides a good forces in the effective distribution.
"If it modified asphalt, would distribute the forces is even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the wear class," he tells us, "will make a final class, the so-called Tragschicht from tiny stones, i.e. from sand, also in asphalt gebadet.
Since this class in contact with the car tyres, they need greater mechanical power than the wear and it must produce friction.
This effective receives the most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs a proper thickness and the material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to be taken into consideration, above all the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of wear class.
If the site is wet, filthy water in the class and is just difficult again. This causes a softening of all sections of the road surface and, as a result, the incidence of blow holes.
If a blow hole occurs, "he said," will begin the deck class City during the wear class only then will be affected, but the damage was not immediately, but it is a process that at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) said that the vehicle load another important reason for the incidence of blow holes. Therefore the thickness of each class of the surface is in relation to the vehicle weight, and it must be ensured that, in order to prevent frequent blow holes this rule is respected.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research in coming, for example, Asphaltemulsionen in other countries are already on the market, and the blow holes simply and without the use of high temperatures could repair.
