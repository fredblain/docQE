On a personal level of mass slaughter
Peter Englunds begins sensitive and generous new book "beauty and horror: A History of the First World War, told in nineteen Schicksalen" with a long list of key personnel, a heart.
Here a typing of proceeding: Are you this side carefully and make it to your read signs.
They are these people in Englunds romanhafter narrative know each other very well, and the main people than your GPS function as a beacon in these few moments where you like Englunds men and women lost in the fog of war and your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book that he not incorrect as "a work of anti-history".
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There is little ambassadors, reckless reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he said, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, ideas, experiences and feelings."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experience of 20 more or less unauffälligen men and women on both sides of the war of schoolgirls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, losing limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives on as the Votivkerzen future has come in a church, some are added, while other lapse.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrected the notion that the First World War was just the disastrous position war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" ends with experts view on other war theaters: The Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetsefliegen are an intractable problem.
This is almost from the beginning, a very moving book.
The war swamped the lives of these people as a natural disaster such as a hurricane Katrina, after Kordit smell.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance. You stay or take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war is being fought.
"Lack of facts," Englund is, "with suspicion, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams and nightmares and rumours aufgemöbelt."
"Beauty and horror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard stamp, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories, letters and other things have already taken (material.
Their lives can be shocking or simply reports, but they are very alive in details in Englunds loses accumulation of small moments.
Many of them act of shortages and affordable remedies.
In the history of a German Schulmädchens told him: "Replacement, everywhere."
"Spare coffee, false aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He told more of the spare lunch in Germany.
He describes "meat from large compressed piece of rice and in Hammelfett gebacken (and most recently served with a false bones from wood), tobacco, from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden besohlt."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food spare funds in the manufacture of sausages were allowed, 511 registered coffee substitute means."
Some stories act of honour and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "It feels that, despite everything, that is, rather than for men was scheduled to sit in Lehnstuhl, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in the hand, and to act as a means to such a veneer of civilization and as if there were no barbarism behind its own strengthened and beschlagenen shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier to die and that he probably nobody notice or would be done.
"If one of the idea of self-sacrifice, we would like to think that this is happening before an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is so terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations act of the old Europe, the fall apart, and on new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition," Englund writes, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he called "a new species in the young century Bestiarium": "The eloquent and ideologically committed mass murderers in the yardstick, the murdered while he sits behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there are equally frivoles behaviour as heroic acts.
Englund is discussing the soldiers who are actively trying to a prostitute being infected with a sexually transmitted disease, in order to escape the front-line services.
"The grotesque expression of trade can be found with Gonokokken-Eiter, because soldiers bought and grease on their genitals, in the hope, to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who really have been desperate rieben him in the eyes, which meant that they were blind to the rest of their lives."
This translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves Englunds poetry is elastic and yet unaufdringlich and fits in perfectly with his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, as the war "on unique way uncontrollable forces Unbound: Extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to ask why they fought for their leaders.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarques "In West nothing new" as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glory hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a Sachbuch.
I am no longer.
But it is as if he is with his book this side of the main persons in the face with a coup and snapped up wood lit.
