The court approved for 2015, the transition to digital television in Mexico
The conversion of analogue to digital signals in recent years is one of the world's most important changes.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN), the constitutional complaints from the Senate and House were filed against the presidential decree, under which the switchover from analogue to digital signals from 2021 must be brought forward to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes, the challenge to the law are required.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, took the view that the President Felipe Calderón have not exceeded his powers when he the legislative decree with the details of the switchover to digital terrestrial television provided.
With this decision was launched by the Senate rejected constitutional dispute, because he did not obtain the required qualified majority of eight votes, so that the court is on the constitutionality or the non-constitutionality could decide the law remains in force.
The project for the action that the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was suggested that the law decree unconstitutional, since for the radio and television regulations affecting the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federale Commission for telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for the legislative decree the hierarchical principles and keep the bill would contradict.
Only Zaldivar voted in favour of the project, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero itself.
With this argument ranged from both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies constitutional complaints against the law decree. After the adoption of the complaints the Minister Sánchez Cordero the legislative decree and was no longer in all activities for the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers rejected the complaint by the Chamber of Deputies, without going into the debate on the project, for which the Minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible.
In his speech, the prime minister, did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the government is not with general rules the measures the public administration should take to regulate.
"I do not believe that, if you do this, the independence of the regulator would be disrupted." It reminded that for the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons the central state government is responsible, because this is the state of affairs.
The replacement of analogue signals through digital is one of the most important changes in recent years around the world, and it leads to a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increase in the quality of the signal and more channels.
Delaying the conversion, they said, was a postponement of the enjoyment of the digital age, a decision which was in the public interest, not only technical aspects, "because it covers economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, said, "were the actions of the whole system, according to the principle of economic management by the state, they included a group of characteristics of the Constitution in the hands of the central state government battery."
It called to mind that many countries around the world have already implemented the digital switchover, on the government, even though they have highly specialised facilities.
It could not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested legislative decree in the powers of Congress great reticence, because the laws passed by the legislature would be respected, "she said.
