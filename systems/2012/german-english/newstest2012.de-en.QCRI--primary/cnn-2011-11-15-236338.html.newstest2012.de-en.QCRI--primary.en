Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled the Congress on Monday, as he previously warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed, he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon's to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon is already through cuts amounting to $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts to $600 trillion or more will be needed if Congress does not end in the spending can achieve.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and South Carolina's Lindsey Graham,.
He said that a failure by Congress in reaching a budget agreement, leading to a so-called seizure will lead to 23% overall cuts and a freeze of many new projects.
"Such a large cut, implemented in such ill-considered way would most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot make three-quarters of a ship or buy a building - and other modernization efforts seriously hurt," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We were also forced to involuntarily by a large part of our civilian staff to separate and that the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would almost certainly kinds of civilians, in order to achieve this goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were ultimately take the combat forces, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the anti-terror fight by the seizure not directly affected, would be a serious violation of the basic budget adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Staff attitudes have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring, to supporting the war."
"The salaries of staff would be cut, leading to late payments to war-time dealers, and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts in the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.
"This is a result with which we cannot live, and it is certainly none that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators on a compromise the pressure will increase in the budget or demands, the Pentagon will be exempt from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken about the possible cuts, even though he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and in the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon's, and knows that he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, Defense Minister graphic picture of a gloomy picture of what could face a military with skin, but without nuclear.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"There is an air without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential opponents."
"It is a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our global operational and Eingreiff√§higkeit, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the major defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those who already have been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike fighter, a planned new bomb plane, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle, the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
The further development and testing of the F35 stop, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but advocates say that it is an important next step is to build-up, so that potential dangers posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
