Trade union of carers because redundancies will file a complaint against the city
The union, the hundreds of Schulbetreuern last month have lost their jobs, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies because of their disproportionate influence on schools, poor students, not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance, the trade union, District Council 37, in their efforts to undo the redundancies, still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig Schulhelfer, care coordinators and other staff, are among the lowest paid employees of the city, and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, the trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for that last year the city of access to a health care fund, which had the working groups, had denied the budget gap should be closed.
These accusations were categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, said Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, last month, the redundancies are part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the City Council shot back and told him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that Schulhilfe staff would be made redundant.
Officials of the City Council 37 said that they had the Ministry of Education and warned against a complaint. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the submission of the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The complaint, Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant, eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of which are of color or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice of the city, said that the city was not the case and therefore could not comment on the specific allegations.
According to a draft complaint, the New York Times, the union has on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighborhoods of the city, a complaint for discrimination. It claims that poor schools more workers would have lost, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there was no redundancies on Staten Island and few redundancies in schools or TriBeCa's Upper East Side, 17 Schulhelfer in the District 23 in Brown Ville, Brooklyn, and 46 workers have lost in the districts of 8 and 9 in the South bronx.
With the discovery of the loss of five of eight Schulhelfern, 36 in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says: "This is not a neighbourhood worried parents who can organise donations to budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th Distrikts 3.26% this year has been cut, and have lost money, as the city of their calculation method for the extra funding for any poor school enrolment changed.
The union also complained that the heads of the high schools through the language in a memo to mislead, which authorized the release of care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (German: Transfer) in the United States, usually the exchange of a teacher on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers, who are paid by the central Unit.
"Sechsundsechzig care coordinators were sacked, not handed over," says the complaint.
