The military is growing pressure to crack in rape
This week is an important hearing about whether 28 men and women for failing to intervene in a rape accused before the military court.
It should not happen, there are hundreds of prosecutor for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11 weeks pregnant at night, when she was raped by a fellow soldier.
It was in October 2008 and returned to their barracks in Miramar just north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, the one 12er Pack beer in itself.
He asked them whether they accompany a drink in her room.
"My alarm went on," Lyman said.
But the Texanerin wischte aside their concerns.
I thought: 'Oh what he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had in my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind it, put it down and raped her, she said.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in deciding whether a complaint made against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, have admitted in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., the complaint initially included 17 plaintiffs, but in the following months to 28 increases: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that soldiers who have been raped or sexually abused, and that the military failed to establish a proper jurisdiction to condemn or after the alleged attacks available.
Burke says that they have followed the top military leadership, because the problem there will begin.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation by the leadership."
Burke also says that since February has contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future actions.
Their strategy: Instead of all claimants were lay their eggs in one basket, they will, if necessary, submit many more complaints, in order to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to reject complaint.
The files of the court, the Newsweek, in detail, the lead defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military is not current or former soldiers can be prosecuted for violations that took place in the armed forces.
As a result of the Supreme Court Act of 1950, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government will not be liable for violations that troops on active service.
"The alleged damage during the military service of the plaintiffs," states the document.
The Ministry of Defence refused any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, it is the distinction only in name: Modern wars have rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan, teams of soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in the contact link with indigenous women in the war zones.
The result: Between these two wars 150 soldier died, two-thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time that the military will be modernised, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their struggle: Three other complaints unless they are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran 'Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four main military academies, because of alleged promotion of women hostile atmosphere.
This independent collects the not-for-profit Vietnam veteran of America a complaint against the military, which is on the diagnosis "personality disorder", the rape victims received from the service in order to release a normal procedure, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
In December, the group filed a complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which their discriminatory practices in its dealings with performance requirements for people viewing the said that the service had been sexually abused.
Nine laws have been independently by a mixture of senators and representatives from both parties in Congress, a number of leads.
2010, according to the Sexual assault Prevention and Response Office, Office for Prevention and reporting sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence 3,158 sexual abuses.
But most abuses are not reported and after its own estimate of the Pentagon, this figure included approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases, per year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 per cent of recorded cases in military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of trauma.
Lymans case reported in the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, she was 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders to tell.
She had a rape set and the blood of their aggressor from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, was heard by a judge Lyman. During this hearing, she was asked after the sex, before the attack with her boyfriend.
Six people have said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, which ultimately was acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman said.
"I thought that would go into labor. I ran from the courtroom screaming."
"They brought me in the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out to my commander said: That was not his procedures. This was my procedures."
Lyman was invited to a military psychiatrist, in the end a personality disorder diagnosed and unable to service said.
In January 2010, she was dishonourable, so they have no support.
Whether the complaint, Lyman and the other claimants have put forward, is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, it says: "I think they should move forward."
What between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which criticized for the first time since it was called into question.
I am now lives a critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military, a decade later, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrence, the liability.
He adds: "The odds are against it... but it is important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not their way, Burke, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We in this respect, the military will continue to fight until it comes to reform," she says.
Or until we die, whatever the first.
