We have seen how much deception?
As studies show that every day we lie between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies, but as lies.

Lies to recognize lies uncover "to learn is that for every human being is important, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlor game such as host Aden, where the goal is to "property you!" To expose the deception is a serious know area that is based on scientific data over the past six decades of prestigious universities, the wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most of the old myths about the lies were revealed.
Look into the eyes of a lie.
They stottern, stammeln zappeln suffused with, and not always.
But we should not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A geübter Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the claim that the subtle facial expressions, question and timing.
I have spent several years, the science of comprehensive and ever-growing area of exposing. And it is clear that the ability to expose the deception is a modern, which is easy to learn and we find in our complex world helps, especially if the suspensions or the questioning of persons or negotiations or management to their own professional responsibilities.
Good liar are very good people to assess their interests and to control their own emotions, and they sense intuitively, how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that people are more likely to lie than extrovertierte introvertierte people that men are more likely to "self-oriented" lies are than women whose lies more "to other guide" - typically, they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people reneging on its partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if a person has been revealed as a culprit, others feel less guilty, this person angelogen.
As you can see whether someone is lying?
First of all, by the normal behaviour of this person.
It is called "Baselining", the starting position.
It is a point of reference for later assessment of changes.
You see the attitude, the laughter, the Stimmqualität their attempt person.
They should know better, usually when someone constantly with the foot trippelt, so that they do not unfairly when he during a meeting with the foot trippelt.
Then you look at accumulations striking verbal and nonverbaler behaviour.
Consider these accumulations as a warning bell ringing, not as evidence of exposing.
People who grind to a halt, perhaps, if they try to remember their history, perhaps, their feet towards the door or in the direction they are starting to change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the cessation conversation," this deep, entspannende breathed out by others and the change in attitude that if all the hard questions are over.

Deceptive individuals can also use a distanzierende language: "I did not have sexual relations with that woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if a vexed issue in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if it is a vexed question: "Now... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... in good faith."
This is the answer, rather than objectively true reference, which often set the alarm bells ringing.
There is no magic means to expose of lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to which a exposing is possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can be a victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
