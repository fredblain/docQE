Europe's most beautiful pools
Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, Prunkpools in Budapest: Who travel through Europe, may be black magic - and after a city tour or a migratory the tired legs in Sprudelbädern rest.
A book shows, where promotion in the water on the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder over the past year and a half on a research trip was not in her luggage had one thing missing: Her bathing suit.
Rücklings on water, they looked into high art full-designed domes, they swam marble-Putten on basin margins on they waited, and was on meticulously restored Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
She did a bad, they did so in their note book values - and to know details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools architectural historian Meder answer in this way - and it is now in its just book "bathing joys": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
They led by 13 countries' trip to the most remarkable bathrooms in Central Europe ": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture-Enthusiastin.
With sports have not much in the news, says Meder - only in the water is the different.
Annoying only that Schwimmfans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell must resign, while the smell of Fichtenwäldern Jogger betörenden inhale or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I was asked why swimming pools are always have to be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to warm baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
The leap basin Geplätscher sauna and essential oils - the promotion factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the terms to be served, Meder.
And if the builders of trouble, can be a real Augenschmaus Schwimmhallen: "Instead of a foot soil in bathrooms, a water surface."
"It is transparent, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."
Doubles every look: High vaults, colorful Kacheln, leap boards.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing joys" gives to 190 sides know value on the architectural and cultural history of historic promotion-havens - but especially appetite for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder in their research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent Heilbädern as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-bath in Budapest, they found a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with water in bottles shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many offer spectacular prospects beheizte Freibäder in Switzerland and Austria: While the entire city of Zurich Dachbad has in mind, one can in external pool of Bads in St Anton am Arlberg look at the snow covered - and that there is a window in Dampfbad, from which it continues to monitor the ski yard slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expected bathers in length field: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
For three after the top open parings dampft there in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand out in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in any swimming pool, the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
After many Thermalbäder smelt sulphur, Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so much for fuel oil, which hardly believes that landed in a bad health.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen medicinal water that almost black and whose silt a stain on the skin, once we are sliding into the basin, a promotion-experience of the special nature.
In one place, Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing, however, also disappointed, as they have the freedom and the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz Sonnenbad wanted to visit, it was a abgesperrtes terrain.
The 1902-designed by the architects Dušan Jurkovic bath has since been closed.
As Meder verwitterten look through the windows of the red-white-and-yellow youth style-building raised, saw it as weeds between Fliesen wucherte.
On the other hand, the decline was countered in a swimming pool in the Black Forest: The Palais in Wildbad thermal bath.
Three construction schedules, this bad already behind it; you can discover not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added in 1900.
Since the thorough modernisation in 1995, the Palais's favourite thermal bath of pool knowledge Iris Meder - and not just because they originally came from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, so different Baustile at such a great unity to merge," says Meder.
In such a palace in Thermalpool Tauchgang is apparently only a sideshow.
