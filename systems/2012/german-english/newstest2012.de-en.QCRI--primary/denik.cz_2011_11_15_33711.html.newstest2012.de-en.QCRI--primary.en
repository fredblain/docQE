Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR authorized GOVERNMENT travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agents were mainly sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were at the time, only a select few.
And so Czech tourists travelling to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic, the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to use.
A lichte exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then beat Yugoslavia a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist era, it was that there are not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed under the socialist countries to travel freely.
If a citizen of ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even in the Soviet Union, then he wanted to go to a so-called invitation letter, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.
Even then, the travel agents also travel to the West, but then we had to accept huge queues or sleeping bag before the travel agency sent, or at least "good friends" in the travel agency.
Even so, the matter is far from over.
The so-called currency commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - was only "politically reliable" gives people - the others are not allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not a free exchange at face currency without foreign commitment so it would have been impossible to make the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West to find.
Which is why most Czechs weither spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs and countless Wochenendhäuser dachas bought - a habit that lasted until today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 revolution was followed by a trip to the foot of the Czechs.
Until 1989, during a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of its foreign holidays in countries around the world.
An enormous paradox, whose today no longer aware, is the fact that one of the most popular holiday country the Czechs - Croatia until 1989 could not travel at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 1990s of the last century, the foreign exchange requirements in the neighboring West European countries, which is a huge wave of short visit especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were long time from their trips to the West simply cannot get enough, everyone wanted to at least a couple of days there.
So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would then have the money for a shelter in the hotel or a pension.
A typical feature when they travel abroad by Czechs was a canning, beer and duration sausages etc vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna, after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and that the average salaries rose to 1997 in another important moment einmündete.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began the travel agents after 1997 prepare regular visits by charter flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already exchange unemployment payments with all the advanced countries in the world, which made it even easier travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel was in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand for the first direct charter flight in an exotic country-cleared after Thailand.
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
Of the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel in exotic countries every year.
Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" development marked, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the US visa requirement for Czech tourists on which our country is definitely in the advanced countries in the world einreihte.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%), and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.
