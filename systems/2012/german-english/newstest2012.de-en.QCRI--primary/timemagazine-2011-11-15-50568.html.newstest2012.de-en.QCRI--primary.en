7 lessons of the interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which this week was shown in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October some compared him with Henry Ford and stressed the engineering genius as a great modern inventors.
What Apple fans, but perhaps the most telling the recently discovered jobs-interview, which this week before special film displays on the major markets has been dusted off, is how much this creative head business processes and procedures.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed Hippie, but he was also a meticulous detail organizer, keen to Diagrammen bastelte - a man who believed that many business leaders to "a disease of thought", "a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product."
Bob Cringely in 1995, the TV series' triumph of specialist idiots "on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with jobs, in a rare, in-depth discussions.
At this point, as 10 years have passed since jobs had been pushed from Apple, and he has worked hard on his new computer company next and looked forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
Jobs death discovered only after a full VHS-copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly revised film material forms the basis for the film "68minütigen Steve Jobs: The Lost interview," this Wednesday and Thursday in the country Mark-theatre.
For someone who is known for his detailed interviews abhors, jobs are surprisingly keen to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtfully.
During the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds at home, where jobs are clearly weighing his thoughts and accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfect on days when he apparently impatiently awaiting him anschubst Cringelys questions and respond more quickly to issues or alongside acts of greater importance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone included the people interview somehow seems incredibly far-sighted if Jobs assesses what other companies make him right or wrong and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to posthumous awards to read 'career jobs, but jobs here as the begierigen dreamers to see on the leap to the grandeur is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could be and should be.
Shortly after he had said all this, and he made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of lost interviews:
As he got a business to run.
"Throughout the years in business, I always ask:" Why if you do things? "And the answer you always get is, 'Oh, it is easy."
No one knows why he does what he does, no one in the business really thinks about things in detail.
I have noticed.
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline accounting for Apple.
Puzzled as costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" on mere suspicion towards were quantified and then with "departure" adapted, he developed an automated factory, which ensured that micro-business costs could be determined.
As the Pope veralbert:
Jobs told of the blue box "with Steve Wozniak built a device to creep into the telephone company and long-distance calls for nothing.
On the device much has already been written, but Jobs enthusiasm when he crossed the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung describes is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box, a gebührenpflichtiges phone use and then make a phone call from an AT & T's network to another, while so many satellites as possible by them.
"We gave the half a dozen times around the world and if you into the phone grölte, there was a minute later in the phone next door," told kichernd jobs.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself, the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world can control."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would give Apple without them.
Jobs told further from a glorious d'état, Wozniak and he almost pulled out, as they are in the middle of the night in the Vatican via Blue Box ringing with the Pope wanted to talk, while it as best they could to Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope himself to the phone.
As he has in the technology verliebte (and unprepared Bill Hewlett dispute):
At the age of 12 years ago, when he sought to spare parts, in order to build a frequency meters, he sought after Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute telephone call received a Teilzeitjob jobs for the summer at Hewlett-Packard.
"It has had a remarkable impact on me; it was the only company that I had seen in age and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well his staff treated."
Later, Jobs one of the HP-staff, the research laboratories visited the company in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computers ever produced".
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with wide brown master and I verliebte me in it.
I would climb to the top as a teenager at HP and this machine, and programmes for they write.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs about how spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career when he some Platinen einbaute, he was asked by a customer, the entire computer to assemble them.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to both the Zusammenbau and the extradition of ready-made equipment.
Later, when Apple does he remember the problems in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember very strong arguments... you schrien me that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I was on, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, which we could build for $15. It was incredible credible.
On large companies that continue:
Long before he was revived Apple, Jobs the ways in which so many industrial giants in Stolpern clashed with their vision and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so make a better Kopierer or printer, so what?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company no more successful.
Sales and marketing make it successful, so these people [are], which will ultimately lead to the company and the product with which the people are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The product genius, which has led to this monopoly of the people who have no idea about good products versus bad products, eradicated art, craft.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft in the 1990s can be...
They have caught the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There is plenty of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if this great idea, they change and grow."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
We must votes, certain things that you can't do, but electron, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5,000 cases, these concepts, and they all together...
Ultimately, it amounts to the taste, it is that they are trying to deal with the best stuff that people have created, and then tried to bring these matters to you.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always in stealing shamelessly grandiose ideas.
Part of what made great Macintosh was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
