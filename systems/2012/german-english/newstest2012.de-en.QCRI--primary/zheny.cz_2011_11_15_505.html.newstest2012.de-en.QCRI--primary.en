The worst female vices: What is it with you?
If the men calls for some typical female vices, then they all shake some promptly from the sleeves.
Dear women, you will see in the following pages, in which a few Unsitten review, the men of the blood Wallen (?
Shopping addiction
Raises them her husband, shopping addiction?
You have to buy at least one conflict on a weekly basis?
Do you like to go shopping in actions and there must also be a bit more?
It is in your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of their shopping mood and try to keep more or less under control.
But hand on heart, what is there already, in search of a good seated upper clothing only through a clothes shop on bummeln and does not include all (in all sorts of Farbkombinationen) in the booth to try?
Even if the shopping for most women is a hobby for the men, it is often the pure hell.
They consider just how often they have said her husband, you may prefer to stick out...
Permanent discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I would have at least five kilos decline - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I heard you at all?"
They know that somehow?
Yes?
Then you probably also belong to the women, the obsession of them are, how they look.
That is by no means that you should go, but many men allergic to respond if their wife constantly upset about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed, with increasing frequency of complaints, women are always unvertr√§glicher.
Order and cleanliness in first
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows, and dust Fliesen sweep, the Wanne scheuern - and it at least twice a week.
You rail with their partner because he once again with dirty shoes on the clean Fliesen trampelt to chastise the children, because it just gescheuerte Waschbecken dreckig again, and because the glass door of a living room cabinet fingerprints has once again when the the whitening so much trouble?
Should you under this kind of "Devianz", then you should know that we should not exaggerate the order and cleanliness in family life does not come first.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Antagonising
"Dirty Turnhosen come in the laundry basket."
"Do you want the old socks really attract again tomorrow?"
"A watery towel not simply on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it brings to the Palme.
Clearly, this is not a bad thing, they want but only that all his order.
If the men they knew then took the women may not be so much to meckern.
Gossip
Some women came to clap and Chen, as is behind the backs getuschelt or even slandered or we forge alliances.
Women are now focused on relationships, so they panting like such issues, such as, for example, who, where, with whom, how and why.
Would any of us women has a bit of harmless gossip at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
But that is not to be confused with gossip aunts most serious calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, the most everyone around them, scorn and especially for women collective, represent a significant danger.
