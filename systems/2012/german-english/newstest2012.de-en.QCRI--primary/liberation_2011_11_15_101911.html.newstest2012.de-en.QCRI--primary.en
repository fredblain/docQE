Europe has invented democracy, now, to consider the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a delicate thing.
The European continent should remind themselves, who after its invention in Athens in front of more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, Holocaustes, the gulag, but also of Franco in Spain, Portugal and the Salazars Supreme in Greece had about themselves.
Some had probably believed it sufficient to exercise the right to vote in any way progressing democracy once and for all to see triumph over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it is a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient, condition and can just as well to the "oppression instrument", as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: A public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation that separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we are in an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost political and democratic crisis.
The change of the Greek true-wrong-referendum would have insightful character in this regard had twice: Once the need for a strong return of policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of their inability to their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle today have shifted, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain by the success of the national referendum, which, depending on the needs and perverse sequence was organised.
A free licence for the European single ruler or a leap into the void with nationalist withdrawal: A groβartige choice for the citizen.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clarified and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, moreover, no longer, where the list to an end - because there is only one crisis, and this is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, which is the dictates of markets and rating agencies prevents that under his powerlessness and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and so that each of them connected nations.
The urgency is the popular sovereignty back the leadership of the European project.
As it is, on the whole, whether the Europeans to reduce its debt burden from the markets open and a future by investing forms.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level to the condition, which is not without complete democratic Rechtmäβigkeit can be taken without us quite sure to ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the socialists have been fighting for a long time, today every European economic governance.
I agree.
But this without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind, that would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In France, the Republic to arise, it took the fact that Republicans to "create."
The revolution of interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
On the economic front, we need a more integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to Europe.
