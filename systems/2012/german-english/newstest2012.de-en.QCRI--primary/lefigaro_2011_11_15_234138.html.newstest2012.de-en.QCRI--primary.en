The world gemäβ of Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and lack of knowledge about China, Iraq and support for Israel.
Can a crisis weakened America a complex world with simple, not to say: Stupid ideas?
If the Republican presidential candidate is listening to the voters could almost get the impression.
For several days I Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their supporters their thundering declarations and statements regarding the Auβenpolitik, traditional republikanischem focus, consistently reported.
On China, Iran and the Israel-aid - often fall-in any way - slogans.
The terms of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" in the course of the highest possible Mitt Romney threatened the Chinese to quote from the WTO and the "currency manipulation" - leading issue in an America that the exodus of entire industries to Asia at Äuβerste prickly - to accuse.
Gone stupid, if this is the introduction of a trade war would imply, he said.
Jon Huntsman, a former ambassador to China under Obama and one candidate, a mature vision of Auβenpolitik seems to have had nearly the emotions about his performance, the strangled schmeichelnden.
He had a solid, but constructive talks with Beijing exchange (also called the current position Obama's).
But Huntsman will not be heard, because he was in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also had praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to Stoppung of the nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I leads to Iran," he had getönt.
"Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
Auβerdem he has promised to increase military aid to Israel and Obama accused this partner has to commitments.
The businessman Herman Cain, second-highest platzierter candidate, for its part, is a shameful acts ignorance.
He recently called on the Chinese military threat against, as Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear power" and appeared in eight auβer the fact that China has since 1964 in possession of nuclear weapons.
The Texas Governor Rick Perry Israel supports and military strikes against Iran, for its part, äuβert, agree to the American army in Mexico against drug cartels in service.
Obama's 2009 forbade using Foltermaβnahmen towards mutmaβlichen terrorists was also of Cain, Perry and Kandidation Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, a auβenpolitischen emphasis.
The current presidential opponent, Reagan was also simple ideas and in spite of the Cold War.
They pointed out that Obama selbstein amateur and water in his wine had to pay, on the issue of anti-terror.
She is right to insist on the failure of his naïve Zwiegespräches with Iran, the premature withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which is also the name of weakness.
These Anfeindung, however, is not quite so freely.
The population estimates more positive assessment of the National Security under Obama, Bin Laden has switched off.
Since the Iraq Upholds before military intervention, which lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprised adequate, he argues that America needs to be rebuilt in its leadership position to rekindle.
