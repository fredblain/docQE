V need for speed, "the run '- the illegal race across America
Review
Originally, careless driving through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantischer error routine journey for the early shift.
It was, for the most part the ambitions, but what use is that, if there is clearly no one wish to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, inspired the new part with the title "The run 'high expectations.
He promised but already bejahrte games series' need for speed "a step in a new dimension and in the spielbaren demonstration in play, he seemed genuinely not only one of many Action-Rennspielen.
We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But as it is already used in NFS is ultimately a lot different than it had expected.
Sure, there are potentially very decent Arkade-race, but overall the game will be diminished by some unnecessary mistakes in this series is more or less for a couple of years.
So it is not really a mistake more and more signs of basically incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First will be introduced in history, whose main character Jack certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you get wheel - with the task, as the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is in ten stages and distributed more than 50 individual race.
This means that every race on other route will be fought and that the various stages in different, sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
There is no moment the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nicely, although the technical level of graphics than that of the previous sections of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the journey through the desert, herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Atypical elements and bring a little change in the individual race.
For example, in the desert will be surprised by a desert storm, which severely restricts view.
In the mountains, in turn, should you need to watch your step that cannot be killed by an avalanche.
By the way, are quite good running built in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while it tries, the required number of opponents to overtake (in principle a classic race), you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a still expects a personal duel with a single opponent.
And this is also the police who wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animation is a huge hit in which Jack before anyone fleeing and where the players must help him, at the right moment, the right button.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (specifically, only three).
Ultimately, this is the matter more benefit, because at least this element has no chance of being boring - it is in the context of the high point to the elements that make the game diversify.
The Fahrmodell Fußtapfen continues in the previous sections.
This means that from today's point of view, there is no trees, on the other hand, you could not claim that it would be bad.
Anyone who looks realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But an action invited the European Fahrmodell Rennfahren will continue to play very well, although we could find better in the competition.
Until then, as far as everything.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
Unlike the Fahrmodell collision model is not quite OK
In a game of this type is hard to expect that complex disorders and collisions, but if there is virtually no impact on any object clue as to how the car, then it is obviously not everything in order.
Case in point: The close-up or just to oncoming cars "scratches" in some places the other car only slightly, in another, almost identical situation but it turns into a tailspin and wild Pirouetten.
Or the Karre equal to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart-system which is nothing more, as it is always annoying.
The rest Arts are resolved, if total damage or remote ends up the line, then cast a the game back to the last point of the route.
Only - in every race has only five rest Arts.
If it has exhausted, everything is happening again.
The rest Arts is more like a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should be abandoned.
Sometimes, but not even the Restart helps, as does nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Very embarrassing is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, to pass through very specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit through.
Elsewhere, we met at the relevant point "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, whether it be the first and fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent a romped to two oncoming cars get away, but before it even gets to the car in such a position that they must avoid or slow down.
And it does not matter when you get there, everything is designed to this situation is close to your nose.
The opponents have other benefits.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where you always at the same point being overtaken by the same opponents and again, regardless of the time.
This is the most insane at the end of the game on the long bridge in the direction.
The Kontrahent must here seem hell bent on overhaul.
And if he gets one, then of course it makes a point of view, so they started their own car a couple of times in Klump.
Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and exciting events but this intention is so clear that they quickly vermiest the joy of game.
And that is a pity, because despite the game as a whole sold Fahrmodell is quite entertaining and in places such action also charged that almost no longer knows where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what it is to blame, the concept of 50 unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can prevent boredom, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the car exchange during the race.
The stations we must not overlook the route, because here we can change the car, although in most cases the car enough that you just did.
The cars are split into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical operations, for example, at the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way the game history is also the tasks-mode (challenges) - the race in the various premises, which we know from history.
There are not only medals, but also experience points for their own profile, which together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to achieve a higher level of drivers, must be open to different objects: The car started to Backgrounds for the profile.
This is the online operation Autolog, among other things, the results achieved compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here it is: The car in a subway tunnel (as), where one in the dark on the track long-rast (as).
Look at the Tacho points between 150 a 200 km/h (as), but there is suddenly from behind a subway and drive to scrap an uncompromising.
In our editorial we may still argue about whether a blackout of the game makers was or whether the authors is so stupid.
The technical side is not overwhelming but at least the visual overall impression is in most cases very appealing and even brilliant here and there.
All the more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing and that sometimes quite dramatically.
It is, however, specifically the accidents with greater number of concerned, where a continuous FPS is useless.
As far as the Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.
In a bid to as wide as possible scale more young audience, was a Sound Track a lá "of any more" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of need for speed: The run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not by the aforementioned totally unnecessary errors would have held the belief we can claim that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game is somehow unfinished.
In for a klasse pleasure, but you should be prepared that one of these mistakes with the power of Flughafenscheinwerfern sting in the eye.
