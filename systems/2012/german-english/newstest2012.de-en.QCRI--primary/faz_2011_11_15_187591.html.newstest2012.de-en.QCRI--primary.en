The scandal Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste Bank Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was nearly bankrupt during the financial crisis, and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.
Now it is a German.
It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was bekanntgeworden in July 2013 an almost as spectacular new job, board president of the Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected large and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber looked forward publicly praised Switzerland's UBS whether their beauty and whether their newly acquired solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be very different.
A trader of UBS in London had all security systems of the bank and around EUR 1.7 billion verzockt.
UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland vaunted bankers, had to go.
The Board President of UBS, also wounded since then - and all ask: When will finally Axel Weber?
It was already known that Weber, the bank advised by February 2012.
And the board before he takes office in May - not only in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, the tough.
He is not a banker, economics professor and central bankers and would have had time to get to grips certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has once again demonstrated that they have the title of "biggest scandal Bank of Europe".
Because the UBS is huge, until recently, it was the biggest asset manager in the world - and, on the other hand, for years has been reeling from a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is the once-proud Swiss bank saves.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss Vermögensverwalters had combined with ambitious objectives: She wanted in investment banking, a very large number.
It manages the UBS $1.6 trillion in 2007, on the one hand, high-net-worth clients more money than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, was an investment bank in the league of the biggest banks in the world have advanced.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger told: 'My students, I have the UBS was always regarded as a model of good bank. "
"From today, one wonders: How could I just so wrong?"
He was huge.
In 2007, for the first time appears to be that if something went wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising back, until such time as high intellectual and equally ingenious bankers.
A few months later, you guessed what, why he had gone.
The investment banking division had with sub-prime securities verzockt and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder the UBS announced a capital increase of as many as 13 billion francs.
It was indeed for investors, but what about the many until shortly before the nose gerümpft: A non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which it said was that it was not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there was worse.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, following the disaster, the UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation, six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, which the bank they Miteigentümerin.
The whole country was shocked - because they said how dramatically it for a small country if it is so big banks.
After all, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see graphic).
"Once again, we could not save the UBS," says banks researchers Geiger.
The first disaster, the second.
A few months later, surrendered the UBS in tax dispute with America and agreed to publish the data high-net-worth clients, perhaps with the help of the bank being evaded taxes.
They also agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this kid Strafaufschlag.
This well-known the UBS more or less open to assist in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: The aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss bank secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and Board President.
And the exodus of clients' money.
The bank within a few months of their credibility lost in two key business areas: In investment banking by the false speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.
And just a little calmer than it was just when you thought the UBS will now get it again, as follows this unfortunate dealer-story: An individual traders verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notes that something was wrong.
And it seems to be: With the risk management in the investment banking work there is obviously still not.
"With the case of Adoboli, we find that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is sure: "The problem of UBS is that they are not in control of the risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution, with the Swiss bankers took a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: Not too many risks for security for money even beyond the Alpine republic in the world.
The coffers of the Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and particularly noble Sprüngli chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of sterling Swiss private bank - it is just a bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich railway station, the main train station from the Zürichsee leads directly by the snow covered summits of the Swiss mountains frames.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Juweliere as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss tradition shops like Confiserie Sprüngli.
Stay here for centuries, the Swiss banks, the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bear.
The reception hall of UBS, one enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are thick marble disguised, leather chair, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking here: Security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS is far too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons had spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS modified, their only received high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution in the subprime jungle lost as much money as the Swiss large bank.
On 15 October 2008, the disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small country of seven million, the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly 45 billion euros allocated the politicians, from bankruptcy in order to save the big banks.
How could this happen?
Talk with Swiss bankers, so they see the problem, especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss big banks to a huge corporation.
There was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and increasingly grew.
It helped that the two different precursor-banks UBS supplemented: A rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they have a huge wheel.
Two names are on the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, group chief executive of UBS, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the hard man, who is from the bank lesson to top up."
But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.
And in the end Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake, "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Excess came before the fall.
Staff at the UBS will remember clearly to the leaders' meetings in which company chief Wuffli was always the same slogan: Goldman Sachs Dethrone.
The US bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
They led the league with "in the rankings, the success of the banks that time documented.
Then, wanted to UBS, according to the top.
A few steps, she has managed to do so.
In foreign exchange business and the stock was trading at the top with them.
Corporate advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: International interest in the business, in which bankers language "surprise fixed Income," there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in mortgage products.
To close the gap left UBS in an adventure that nearly cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the Bank itself invested and above their established hedge funds in American sub-prime assets.
It became a huge machine, the securities on US mortgage loans packaged and far-reaching, but also risks maintained.
Also, as other banks have sought out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was on fire, the UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great the euphoria, so deep.
A manager had to go after the other and clean up the experiments tested more difficult than thought.
Items in the UBS became the weapon and are still shaky.
Anyone who now leads the major bank, has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which lost all obvious business models.
Banks researchers Geiger already has an idea: Stop the investment banking, focus on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the Bank may not (yet).
But that investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually intended only as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprising Grübel separated by predecessor.
Meanwhile, he has won: He is in the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to roll back the in the mid-1990s.
He cut 3,500 jobs.
But it will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you make money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
So far only publicly he says that he and his wife, once a home in Zurich.
Next year.
