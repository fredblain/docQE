Walls have eyes: How researchers watching you on Facebook
Before the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many boys, whose anti-immigration views online programs.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed in a killing spree in Norway in July to have committed, in which 77 people were killed, his first public court hearing.
Despite Breivik acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: He has a lot of time until his attack on his computer, with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, the right-wing extremist groups on the part of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you only have to connect on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank demos on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, says Bartlett, the researchers simply Werbetool side must use their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - as retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then with Adds visierte, but rather than with a new band or a new diet product verlinken, have invited the Adds users to a survey in which according to their level of education, their attitude towards violence and the assessment of their own future was asked.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - without having to consult once had to leave her office.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoter of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising distortion, "their online activism offline activism combined with a more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideas factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the side in order to study everything from health and social trends such as "Likes" text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, on average, three content per day, data generated Facebooks supernova explosion "a research boom, the number of scientific work with the name of this side in the title in the last five years was almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook, the fact that we can study this side of people, which are normally in the street with his Clipboard not achieved.
"If you previously tried to people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and never have access to them," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is all that away, you will go directly to them."
Others say that the party offers an opportunity to identify and social health problems to solve.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who were discussing their full binge on Facebook, significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, the Wohnberater side monitor and a student help if they too many status updates postet.
"You can't solve a problem if you have not recognised," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Children's Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found an opportunity to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would have been found."
Facebook also constantly zapft data of its own people.
The data team of side has statistics on the relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the mid-term elections in 2010 and a National Happiness index created (and primarily data have been used to access Facebook - the only master of digital freedom have known for a long time that the side of their great data mine of others for research purposes should make available.)
But the users of Facebook know that the side they watched, whether they like it or not, with a friend, the thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, one of the side's own personal data auszubringen.
But what if the users of Facebook part of a survey, they do not even know about?
While researchers strictly defined guidelines as to how they collect data offline, anything goes online.
"I do not believe that many users are reflecting on the fact that the researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006 in which he public pages of students on Facebook studied.
"What concerns them, it was just about them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participants is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information in a user profile and contributions are true.
"What we say and what you on Facebook outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as technology researchers that a Clipboard and a pen is still the best research tools -- that everyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk with real people," he says.
"Social research must be the social care - and plenty of social life is still offline."
