Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows their losers.
Muammar al-Qaddafi is due to an unknown location buried in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now, only the winner.
As usual, this region Islamists triumph in the elections, the only question is what - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council is known for the common law of Schar朝平a, which we are now has some idea of God.
Libya would the country without crime, because for theft hackt it in short the hand.
Women should also think of emancipation quickly forget any religious renegade are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the company from each other in future feuding tribes united by the Koran.
In short, in Libya will be an order, which almost inconceivable here and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively, probably not the best and would change the Libyans hardly mentioned.

In their defence, may well serve only the fact that NATO's bombardments not by any General from America, but from Allah self-guided, whose omnipotence after every successful hit was praised.
The winner in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We were only in a gun, served the interests of Islam and reasserted our politicians in the hands of a political ally, without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.
This is a concern going on here - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies but also without occupation of the black gold to the silver price?
Hardly, and so can the West once rightly his selflessness in protecting human rights boast.
If they do not spoil the Schar朝平a-representatives.
