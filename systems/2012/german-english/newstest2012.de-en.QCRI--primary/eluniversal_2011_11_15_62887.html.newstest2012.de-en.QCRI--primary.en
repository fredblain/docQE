MSS announces a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity in
The Social Security Institution of Mexico is leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - Mexico's Social Security Institute (IMSS) announced that it is a research project to the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth", with the genetic markers associated with obesity are to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department for medical research, focus biochemistry) at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro regions Médico Nacional Siglo XXI said that an interdisciplinary team composed of doctors, Krankenpflegern, nutrition specialists and social workers was built.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of Postgraduiertenstudiengangs at the Instituto Nacional de Salud pública (INSP) and the Centro regions de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can on sports fields of IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8 a.m. tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) began and since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue.
If the aim of 500 to 600 persons inquiry is achieved, the study on the sports ground of Independencia (in the south of the main town of Districts) and continued in Morelos (in the north of the main city Districts) completed.
He said that the aim of the study was the understanding of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people on the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he said it would seek that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents nutritional fill out questionnaires.
You will also be questions about their physical activity and their family disease in history to risk factors that lead to diabetes and renal insufficiency may have to control.
He also led to the investigation of the aforementioned Saturdays persons measured (weight, height, Taillenumfang) to control their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said, this would take place at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys to 77 per cent and the girls with obesity increased by 47%. The obesity has risen dramatically," said the specialist of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico from the other international differences.
He stated that a (e) (in) on average 65 per cent indianisch-American, European and 30% to 5% of African descent, which is in the genes, with diabetes and obesity, '.
More generally, he said the genetics of obesity in the inability to express the surplus of detainees to burn energy (calories), so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefit for the study participants would be in a comprehensive study of children, were found, whether such a degree of obesity and obesity.
It would even the presence in the neck and dark Hautfalten Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolism disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information will be treated as confidential and parents in writing of the doctors told the doctors say parents beat them all measurements and lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there would be three basic factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases are responsible, lack of exercise, the lack of movement in everyday life, for most of the day in front of the television and transport to spend, rather than short track walking.
The high caloric intake, which means that an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and total carbohydrate content (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics in this research project is to be analysed.
