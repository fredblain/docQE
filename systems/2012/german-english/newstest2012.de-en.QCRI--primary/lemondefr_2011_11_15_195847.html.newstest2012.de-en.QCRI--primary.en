What represents reports of fraud in sick?
After the family subsidies are now sick UMP and government reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family allowance to pay and a speech on this - since 2007, been recurrent theme of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state.
To accompany this attack by the desire, the economy is in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, wants the majority of workers ill reports.
Start with the economic objectives: The government is seeking the introduction of a fourth Karenztages before taking a sick notification of workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without the approval of the specific company would lose the wages of four days, so at least 15% of their monthly income.
A Maβnahme which, according to the newspaper, "Les echoes" provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.
And with a different Maβnahme rather symbolic nature go hand in hand: The state officials a unvergüteten Karenztag event for the disease (so far are there for them, in the three Karenztagen Gegensatze in the private sector, no Karenzfrist).
Meanwhile, in the discussion of these issues are also cranked up the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse is associated with Arbeitsabsenz targeted.
"Checks will be far more important, and furthermore, these rückzuvergüten, if that is required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent activity in the areas of ill requests a little unproportioniert.
This is, in fact, already the subject of constant observation since 2002 and political offensive operations, the most commonly have borne fruit.
The French are not sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
But first we dwell on the nationwide paragraphs.
According to the country were CNAM health insurance fund in 2006, more than EUR 237 million days compensation paid off.
Gemäβ of Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, the days of compensation in 2008 with 11.3 billion euro 5% of health spending.
This figure fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54% on Krankheitsurlaube that heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.
An average of concealing certain differences: Another in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40,000, French workers said, no single Krankentag.
Another, this time from the health insurance covered study makes it clear that 37% of ill requests in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend not more than elsewhere, inability to work.
In 2010, the two researchers of the French, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) led long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001 global Absenzquote (justified) oszillierte away or otherwise, in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in ill reports is a tiny proportion of undeclared work.
With regard to the fraud is only a weak Ausmaβ.
Since 2002, encouraging the legislation means that it controls on sick systmatische reports, the 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public high school for education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the lost 285 of past, short-term sick reports that heiβt in 37,050 cases, "unjustified or too long."
The systematic controlled ill reporting cases of more than 45 days in duration was 1.2 million 11% of "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, the heiβt 132,000.
Overall, this is 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who made an ill.
A paragraph that only a weak Ausmaβ compared with, for example, those of undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP deputies Dominique Tian, author of a published in July Sachberichts regarding this issue, this is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax earnings per year, which is more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation at last.
