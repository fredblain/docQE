Read an excerpt from the interview, whose full transcript in the online edition of La Naci√≥n.
For your Costa Rica niche fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what it means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream that is for us.
This is only the second time that we in South and Central America, and so far, it is great.
I am just once on holiday in Costa Rica. It is such a beautiful country that we will stay there a few days.
For us, it is exciting, our music out there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely; they are the closest possible days before the concert.
What does your your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years on our side.
We have almost 21 years until we have come to Costa Rica. Thank you, have been waiting for so long, and we are very sorry to have taken so long before we got here.
Some people are even of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have in the past 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we want to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are excited by the jungle, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you Costa Rica and its waves to surfing got?
Many of our friend, a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends are always on the surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico are the outstanding areas for surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have heard about it.
With a view to the Tour you giant shows with many songs.
Do you have any plans for the event in Costa Rica?
We have never played there, we are also no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want a few songs from each album play and our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
She never repeats your repertoire.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and more than 120 songs can play. Each like another song, so the decision, which we will play is not easy.
If we have two or three songs that we no longer have long played into the repertoire, we can maintain our focus better and they come as a surprise to us, because they remind us of the reasons why we have these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this Tour celebrates its exporters twenty years of history.
If you look back, you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
First of all, I believe that none of us are presented in a great rock band to play, and over 20 years, which looks like a dream.
We are also continuing to this blessing and find it great to still be able to make music together.
Let us and we are excited about music.
We are lucky to be able to go places in the world, which we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What was it for you, at the birth of Grunge participated actively?
It has always been an honour to this group of large band.
We are good with the people of Sound Guard, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and rather unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured, part of the Seattle-group.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guard at the Tour. We look forward, still to be friends with all of them and it is to our credit, part of this Seattle-Sounds that have arisen.
It is very unusual for a band like the companies with the same musicians together for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago to us. This alone is much more time than many band survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to still be alive and we care about each other.
We are all close friend why musical avenues that each individual freedom to experiment.
The other is a familiar and whose music. It could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, konntet their thanks to your success always do what you wanted a.
How is a balance?
The way we are grown, has made it easier to find a balance.
We are certainly not too often on Tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
Until you consider that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must respect without hell-bent a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway.
What memories you have in your other project Mother Love bone?
I think we have very good songs written and at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never issued a record.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band were friends, when I hear a song or photos, I think of what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work together to laugh and music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that she knows their work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and the band have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and the band liked best. That is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas live. This is exciting.
Why does the text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he chooses.
Bassist and by whom you got to be affected?
By so many +
Among the first to come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I have the whole afternoon on the Bassisten, I like to talk about.
How has it Pearl Jam managed to keep alive the Grunge, although it is not a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band that I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Guard, Nirvana and everyone else who was at the same time, if they still are important, I think it is great, because it is worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem a bit lightly, but there are other songs such as The End or Just Breathe as a very dark songs, even though they have something positive.
Both came to me to tears when I heard they played as Ed. There are very dark songs.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happens in your life - for example, if you have a family member or a friend loses, it affects your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs embody the clear for me.
However, I also believe that it is a happy person and still dark music.
