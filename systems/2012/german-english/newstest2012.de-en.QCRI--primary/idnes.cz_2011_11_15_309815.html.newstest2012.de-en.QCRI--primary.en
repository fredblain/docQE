Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a bit gemeckert that is a bit too much fuel for the start.
Little did I not in the slightest, even more.
Lectures from three professionals from the industry, the clothing problematic characters and a seminar on how the "on the job".
There is worse to come.
The closer examination, the more information and practical tasks we have before.
But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, it is fully documented.
This time we debated with director "Ethyl '(the rate is not one man's), as it attracts a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And this is, after all, most of us.
Some have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of Stylisten, broad shoulders look to conceal the neck or the need to extend hervorzuzaubern curves.
We also got clues, as a Frauentyp as Jennifer Lopez - with great bosom, broad hip and narrower pretty slim waists and attracts figure emphasises, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between slim waists and Hüften is so great that the skirt or trousers really not fit, you should at least a little under schneidern.
This will certainly not regret it because, well-seated clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel is much better than in an off-the-shelf, and constantly verrutscht of slim waists absteht, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can, in turn, allow clothing with wrinkles, construction, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
With this amount of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week, I thoroughly over.
And yet, I fear that in the face of assigned homework almost impossible to achieve.
Each of the course participants received a Promi allocated for which they should devise suitable attire - days clothing and Abendrobe.
This is the current design, fashion and style of the respective stars whose Figurtyp account.
I should attract Miranda Kerr "," you may be the campaign Victoria's Secret.
I juble internally, because this is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera to attract the last time has grown to hundreds of kilograms (okay, this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, and then grafisch first.
In "Moodboard", as the outcome is known, is our personal style and our relationship with the Count's design.
It is very important, even on the graphic side of the Stylings.
The Stylist, the model is not only physically, but also in the so-called product side in the journal (for specific target, for example, trend-handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But it was only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist have a good overall picture.
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday lecture was equal three visitors from the industry seasoned:
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, from Jakub Polanka fashion designers and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion illusion is a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
Stylist and eingeschickter can with a single piece of clothing in a completely different way to work.
The magic word is variability.
You can, for example, a business as usual on the Trenchcoat wearing jeans, a T-shirt or coat, but also on the naked body, shoes and attract him to wear a dress.
It is enough, the sleeves or the collar hochzukrempeln and equal, the whole look very different.
"Is it," he said.
But most of all, I want the following advice: "First you perfectly know the rules."
"Only then can they violate it," said Jakub.
Finally, clear to me why we need all these theories loud fanfare, which you can combine with what and why, even if in Modejournalen often quite different to see.
Not to mention of fashion look.
Thanks to the photographers Ben I know now that a Stylist much more clothing options must be prepared when he photographed at the end.
So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared at least 15 to stylen.
And also that the clothing on the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite different than in reality.
All of this must be in shaping the attire.
That image and Styl sometimes half of success, which also Jan Pokorný confirmed.
You only need to Madonna, a not particularly brilliant singer, from the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is one of the services of a Stylisten rather wary.
Well-known personalities do often wasted money (the main thing is that I am, as I look at is secondary).
And if one of us stylen, then we should expect that he or she is likely to have a very different (smaller) size on when he or she really needs.
Then we need only to subsequently googlen to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the corresponding Promi again or have declined, etc.
Jan and Mario presented to us on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the clothes "assemble" needs.
In his work he needs above all to communicate with the people he stylt and it must be a clever psychologist.
People, without anzubiedern and his opinion.
"If we have any manager in order to their clothes cabinet to look and beautiful pieces, then it does not eliminate the entire cabinet and say, my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few good things to which it recommends what they can contribute," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what such a so-called "seat pocket".
So a pocket in the slim waists zuknöpft and all necessary Proprietäten in itself.
No such clear things like scissors, Abroller remove the hair or safety needles, it contains, such as a Nylonfaden (so that helps the Stylist the photography products, such as handbags and hats), specific clips, which is behind the clothes gerafft, if it is too large (Stecknadeln or other klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken Nähzeug) and of course.
But we must not only listen, but also try something practical, we learned how to put right in shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor is, you can damage the Schuhsohle, let alone the outside.
Us o klebten and klebten we...
With the gap, we should not affect the shoes, so that they are not damaged.
So we really must be sent.
Mario enjoyed me by my "creation" praised without restrictions.
The aforementioned skill is not just my strength.
All this was just a fraction of what we in the second weekend-continuation rate to hear.
One thing is clear to me now - the Styling to devote at professional level is not an easy task.
