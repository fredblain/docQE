The CDU proposes that the EU president elected by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig went for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and chairman of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has prevailed in the autumn, in particular to those activists enough that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The Bureau of the European Commission proposed presidential motion was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had just nine voted against ten had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasted several minutes because of their Interventionserlässen first, Angela Merkel and a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, lieβen from the three Euro-minded finance minister, no doubt.
The main idea of Chancellor - as well as the Antrage - following slogan: The answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe peace means, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly from the euro."
The Chancellor is "time for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be through the control of the European Union, reinforcing the overhaul of the Lisbon Treaty in terms of budgetary policies of the countries in the euro zone, and this could be expressed in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote resulted "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals approved by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly in this revolution some: Groβ Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU believe to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
The milestone, however.
Similarly, the delegates in an overwhelming majority of the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing Board under the weight of individual economies rejected what appears to be an awakening of Germany's position.
To reassure the climate within their party thoughtful Chancellor has therefore reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it has not tried to their Congress at the expense of the "small" or the European countries in difficulty to win, which would criticise the arrogant Germany immediately.
As far as the Euro-application of the importance of "Franco-German friendship" a clause, Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this recalls that Leipzig two centuries ago in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
