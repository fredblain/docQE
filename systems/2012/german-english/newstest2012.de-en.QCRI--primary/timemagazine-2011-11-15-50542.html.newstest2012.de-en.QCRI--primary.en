"Cold and inhuman": Different Behring Breivik appears for the first time before a public court
Different Behring Breivik, the man who stood two Amokläufe where this summer were killed 77 people in Norway, even in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" fighters.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a temple Knight of Norway," he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, since you have received your mandate of organizations that support the hate ideologies and because it has the support of multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I am not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim canceled Breivik during this monologue, because he "wanted to give the possibility not Breivik this hearing to use as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused a pre-written speech mitbrachte, the permit, at the end of the hearing to the relatives of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for 12 more weeks in custody maintains that he four weeks has no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and the entire correspondence about eight weeks will be closely monitoring.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope that Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remains behind bars.
All took part with the goal that all amounts to a wegschließen.
"I thought he is cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me, it is a bit further, having seen and heard the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and helped throughout the hearing. He looked calm and professional journalists and survivors in the eye when he re-entered and left the building.
Despite Breiviks bizarrem hint that he would be part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
There may be some like that the attacks on 22 July appears to be the work of a single extremists and was not a group of radicals.
But relieved that automatically the grief and confusion that still feels a whole nation?
"I wish he would like a monster, but it does not," said the family of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
