Hamburg -
For the German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study that banks with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents want even that Deutsche Bank and other lenders for this business, because the problems of the world's poorest people.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Food Watch in mid-October.
It shows the author Harald Schumann, the betting on the global commodity exchanges pushing up prices - and therefore the banks involved in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protection is directed specifically against Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley similar.
Commodity bet were originally intended for traders to hedge against price fluctuations.
But now, most experts agree that the gamblers from supply and demand have - and at the expense of the poorest profits.
Unlike the US competitors Ackermann responded to the criticism that he promised to look into the allegations and said that no deal was "worth the reputation of Deutsche Bank to jeopardise."
According to information obtained by Spiegel Online examines an International Working Group is currently the accusations from the Food Watch Report.
By the end of the year is expected to be completed the test, then the results presented to the board of Deutsche Bank, with a recommendation, how it should be handled.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will announce their consequences.
In the end, a reduction of the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann forge his image
Foodwatch-leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "The betting on rising prices of food, particularly sharply, as reckless banks today the common good."
Ackermann stand as a top bank lobbyist now, particularly in the duty.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all installations from its portfolio, where money for betting on food prices will be used," said Bode.
"Regardless of whether Mr Ackermann hunger suffering people, or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
The insight of Ackermann, at first glance, it is clear, however, that the group's leader, a few months before his departure from office would make a perfect picture.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the Board chief differently than planned in the supervisory board will change.
With a retreat from the contentious agricultural-speculation he could improve his image.
And potential losses, it hardly needs to end his successor - that would have to be done.
Every second would terminate commodity-related facilities
Foodwatch is trying to put pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users in the campaign of the organisation.
On Tuesday Bode published the poll by the Forsa institute on 7 and 8 November 1001 people questioned.
Just 11 percent therefore believe that it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank offers facilities where wagered on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also personal consequences when they learn that their bank involved in such transactions: Half of the poll would terminate all facilities where money into the commodity-speculation.
43% would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said to reflect on their account to drop out and to switch to another institution.
