Boeing has orders record of 18 trillion dollars in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-type Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option for a further 20 aircraft.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It really is a rare news that a company with a mission about 50 of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for this 50 aircraft overall in a record sum of $18 billion.
Equally unusual is the principals of Boeing, the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast that was published on Monday, estimates the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion needed.
Boeing announced over the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order shall: 50 two standard Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer mission came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline has also, Boeing announced it 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to buy 20 more planes that the entire list price rise to 26 trillion dollars.
Then on Monday ordered according to Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, the fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft stands at more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said produce Dihora, stock market expert of Morning Star.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
Therefore, they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft, but a rise in oil prices, which is usually the airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost items is not so bad, because the country is at a higher price.
This is important because they are less than other airlines tend to aircraft orders to cancel or postpone when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
Emirates confirmed the appointment of Boeing's leadership position in the market for large aircraft and helps the Airbus SAS competitors to contain the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would delay the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence after the customers and reach a higher specifically requested.
The Boeing-shares rose by 1.5% to $67,94.
