Hazard: "What a lucky '
Even before the "blue Dienstagabenden (20:45 p.m.) stand, Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had their pleasure that brought them the friendship game, not hidden.
It would be too wide-ranging to claim that there had been a covert agreement between them, but the picture is symbolic volumes.
Side by side on the Bystanders podium of the Stade de France had George Leekens scenes and Eden Hazard well peace can close down.
Five months after the spirited gesture of his offensive player against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had nothing but praise for his person harvested.
"I am very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgians."
"I would like to look forward," assured the native Liller itself.
With regard to the contrast between his presentation in club and Nationalelf is concerned, "It is a unit that justifies everything."
"I am in Lille throughout the year, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It is time for me to go to the start."
Hazard after Saint-Denis, come Friday night against Romania in terms of Matchs against France, at last, "to shine."
But without the note of the "pleasure".
The French national team he fires since the age of 7 years, he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This will inevitably result in the "extraordinary" nature of this meeting more.
So much in advance, "Mathieu Debuchy (a), Yohan Cabaye, Adil Rami will be there," he quoted.
"We just went through."
"To be able to play against them means groβes luck!"
For its part, with good humour Leekens liess "pride" implies.
"The pride, a Galamatch".
"Pride" and, in his capacity as "neighbours" - to confirm that France "another team has come at a very high level," and a little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Condemns Laurent Blanc has done a good job," he said.
Although Belgium in the next European Cup is lacking, the technicians worked very well the plane with the blue (the French Nationalelf) share... and Brazil in 2014.
"We small Belgians groβ come out," he said.
"We are in the process of a business plan, the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will say that in the forthcoming games." The game against France.
