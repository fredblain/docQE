EU ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon, the balance between the different institutions felt from the Lot."
I would not have expected such a hard war flares. "
"There will be five or six years, until the dust settled, and all of their new role will be used," girl Milena Vicenová began, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, quite sharply its presentation at the law faculty.
How seriously they the motto "understandable and openly about Europe", they showed in the first part of her speech, in which it was the individual EU institutions and their mutual relations on such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of Charles University's law faculty can therefore would envy.
Madam Vicenová also praised the new permanent president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning, criticism that he was too quietly - a grey official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say that it has brought all of how well he has adopted the cause.
"He is a man who has 27 Member States patiently listen, communicate with and, above all, has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said it as an answer to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? What number should I call? ", as an important step towards agreement and better visibility of EU policy towards countries, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our Ölmützer Quargel
Madam Vicenová dedicating the agenda, according to which the European Union, and to live in the near future.
The Czech Presidency of two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs have overcome the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also the summit for Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a great Negativum that the image of the Czech Republic was severely damaged.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, said that it was not just the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis is not yet over, pretty hectic.
And there is still the seven-year EU budget be approved, which is precisely because of the current economic situation is much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget will be the priority sectors which countries more or less be encouraged - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "Understandable on Europe."
"If I may not, then it is gräuliche acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can I actually know as citizens, whether in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and different large banana invented just or whether we actually someone wants to ban the Quargel.
They would also like to the bottom of the EU used to more Czechs in European institutions.
Two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs in the reputation of Eurosceptics, the more negative than positive aspects of the matter.
All the more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to motivation to write letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a pole or Hungarian come to me and Slovaks in the vicinity, it believes the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is it because the heads together - is the back your V4? 'And it makes a pretty acid Face.
According to Mrs Vicenové expect the EU in the future, especially tough rules for the budget policies of the Member States.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of bestärkten cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only the countries should cooperate, who want it and who do not want to be left out."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately to a strong" multi-speed Europe ', "Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this respect, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the whole of the EU will be discussed by all member states, and not only by the countries of the euro zone.
