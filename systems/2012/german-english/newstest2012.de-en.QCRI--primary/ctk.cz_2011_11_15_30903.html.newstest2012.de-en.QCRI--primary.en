The General Assembly is to find a new chairman - again threatens a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk will know.
To date, there is still no agreement on the electoral law to be elected.
And this is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek of his role, and he asked his colleagues in the departure had to some and a strong personality, which could lead to the football in the future.
Only - in the post Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers again Association, which is not able to agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly on 16 September, as the new chairman should be selected.
The delegates to the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiations led to any outcome and it was not only about the election itself.
Indeed, you could not even agree on who is entitled to the full collection is only the statutory representative or with a power-funded officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose opinion, a representation at full power base is not admissible.
Disputes over the electoral law, however, continue to take.
The Executive Committee did not more clarity on the matter at its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election changed a couple of times - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: How do we proceed in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The issue is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the Statute, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate who expressed as the greater support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is reportedly ready to compromise that one candidate triumphs, the higher number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side, in turn, is on the condition that the winner in this prozentuellen vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"Then the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, it would be best to the election in order not to argue, but under current statutes.
This is also surprisingly Tomáš Paclík, even if it emerges that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely to Pelta.
"My wish is that as far as possible the statute is elected."
"So as not to be invented nonsensical ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is standing for the first time in his comments and above all to abgrenzte Pelta.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, is the new chairman Nymburk be known and he believes that the candidate will work constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football only on the euphoric wave sunset, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten and this brings the most experience at both professional and regional level.
There is more circumspect Rajchl.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes," zurechtzubiegen. ""
"That is why a new block in the General Assembly is not excluded."
"However, I hope that common sense prevails at the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all parties, not more.
Some allegedly direct negotiations should take place in Montenegro, but who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität until qualification is complete.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera Rajchl after Podgorice should fly in Prague in the morning because of a technical disorder and not as it sought urgently for a replacement variant, as a part of the executive committee but still at the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
In the end, then surely the meeting at ministerial level, which it said on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education, the divided parties within the country's largest sports associations to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: Benefits Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech football and the forthcoming general meeting ČSTV of the Czech Sport after the financial problems of Sazka the new direction.
Paclík goes in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting would make a strong candidate, for all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) have been met, he would have no cost to the fight for the leadership agreed.
"If there were a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."
"But in the current situation, we did not find such a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík into duel with Mr Jindřich Rajchl Pelta and, it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stresses that it if he wins the role of chairman is only a year until 2013, until the date of the ordinary general meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to hear a top managers, not too much in the football is done.
"With a number of eligible people I have spoken personally."
"Hard to believe that some have said that they intend to do not currently identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would like to have changed," he said.
Most of all, disturbs Paclík Pelta's alleged links with the chairman of the Football Association novel Pilsner district Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of chairman.
"In his victory would today's state einkonserviert and the Czech football if it was not at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem businessman, would get the football twice as bad," said Paclík.
It is also important that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with telephone to identify in a corruption affair, however, emerged from the Pelta with impunity.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory of the (tsch Pelta.) football should bring."
"And as we would in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA position," said řekl Paclík, his former phrase, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman shall," but rather more calmly.
Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, but he could be a future cooperation with Pelta well imagine.
As is also another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the general Assembly in October had supported, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I would have him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is capable of, the association as a manager."
"It is not my nose in matters that I do not understand," said Paclík, raised eyebrows in September it had ensured that he was behind the recall the referee Commission Luďěk Macela at the top was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the direction of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, with its support in May, the first triumph in the league was celebrated.
"I have the power to something in the football environment and to a degree of cultivation of this."
"The impact of certain interest groups which tend to disciplinary and appeal commissions to influence what until sickening situation deteriorates," Paclík led to no secret of his antipathy towards the Sparta, for example, Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, he saw the consolidation of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, through which he among political leaders to evoke that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"This is one of the key things that the new chairman should pay."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, such as the political parties to declare, then I understand their reasoning, then they must also make it quite clear where the money is," he said.
His link to the Pilsner Paclík club is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR should "bipartisan".
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"It is my opinion but not much point in my stock in the Pilsner club hypocritical to transfer to a third person, in order to return again after a year and a half," said Paclík clear.
New statutes of FAČR Pelta promised a stalemate ausschlössen in future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the Vorsitzendenamt, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his election campaign that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law rule out.
The official from Jablonec is before the Thursday negotiating in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would be in any success of the Czech selection safely defused.
Pelta had not carried out before the election in September promised that he would, if elected to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided only at the last moment in the election before the last general meeting and didn't want him to take part in the two-month pause to help his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels are devoted to the football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who, says the man who, especially with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and acted in the Executive Committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience, the Czech football.
He is convinced that for today's problems with the election euphoria is responsible, the days of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the General Assembly approved in June statutes, which were not as perfect as we all thought.
If they are not allowed to have different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman from September, "Pelta said.
The revision of the main document of the citizens association he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I were president, I take it personally and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not work."
"This is a fundamental issue, without which it cannot be" Pelta said.
In addition, he does not try to define his opponent.
He had earlier announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík, no longer, which in turn to Pelta no dry thread.
In football, he has moved more than a year and is already on some successes. "
"His attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"So now doubt many of his true character," Pelta addressed his opponent, probably remain faithful to its repeating proclamations that he already in September.
In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also like to put an end to all Affairen Bohemians - of fog, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"I would shortly after on negotiations with the private and public sector, with sufficient funding to ensure the whole football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his arrival at the top of the Czech football would mean no human cleansing.
"I would like to start with the job content of all employees to familiarise themselves," he said towards the Strahov where, because of the long anarchy has understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming general meeting, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk not in vain.
"If the only point of contention is how, in the third round, then we come over."
"Football needs credibility and win it only when he finally has a new leader," Pelta, two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR below him hard work begins
If the current vice-chairman Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic should be elected, it would supposedly many people in the Association of the whim vermiesen.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his choice to work hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and the members of the executive committee for individual football fields.
In addition, he promised to resolve the case of Bohemians, relations with UEFA and FIFA, more money in football and otherwise, to continue the work of previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."
From the international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, down to the performance of the youth football. "
"This is not to say that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the powers of the Executive Committee so that each member of a certain area."
And I will be hard work, so that the football in each segment with miles steps forward. "
There were many not just delighted because they, rather than just the work of other now itself should start to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered, no longer standing.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people are behind me, which I am not constantly spanner and every step I do, in question," he said as an explanation as to why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because otherwise others would do."
"This is confidence that it must not waste," he said.
Also allegedly motivated him to be able to continue the work he has started in Hašek.
"In two years we have done a great deal of work and I will now not simply throw."
"There were launched processes that have to wait for a few years to come and I would hate to see that they stopp someone," he said, and now his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta were elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach and that is something that not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, especially people who would make the football so that it is only for politicians."
I can be blamed for some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to do is to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because it all goes well and not only the selected," said Rajchl.
It also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I was really the best possible for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league into a Czech and Moravian part should be divided, whose winners will each in the first league felt."
"It might not happen today that only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the struggle for the role of chairman, has joined Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he is elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor for unfortunate contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the association, not a single thing.
While he Pelta says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence to help," he holds the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"No one can question it in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not fundamentally change."
He would certainly not the things in its favour hinbiegen want, "Rajchl judgement on his rivals.
