Park or mountain?
The architects, apart from the disputes over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola again in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now missing Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration on the promotion of their Schmähschrift Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures with the Central Park in New York in comparison.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many back to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few who are not in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and below (Sea).
The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.
Now no longer served as an example of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.
So far, it was when the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates after Collserola purported.
Undoubtedly, a gateway to the concept of a park.
Either that, or someone has, gates to the countryside.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the lift,.
And it is this fact provides the fuel for a rare coincidences between what three architects from Barcelona, think about it, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
"It is necessary for Roldán," after the attack on the coast on the "front in the mountains", as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.
"We should start from the principle that Barcelona largest park of the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "expresses the architect, for the title of" gates of Collserola "a" lexikalische case ": We must not" as access to a park, but as a limit of areas where action is needed. "
Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "some risks".
Risks due to the "uncertainty, the creation of a public space today brings" after the experience of the 1980s, in the area of the Forum their "swan song".
The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.
"Something is always limit, the next step down", i.e. to exceed it.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [in response to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, which is close to the issue, says simplifies the side of Collserola towards Valle Ana, "can be understood as a park towards Barcelona not" for purely topografischen reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study of Patronat de Collserola which are not "should fall on deaf ears," even though he was grateful to the City, his body has given the opportunity, on this project, "from the first moment".
In addition, it says that the proximity of the mountain to the city of Geleitbrief is that it allows the architects of the debate, although his "doubt" to say whether this technical profile launched the multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right thing," he says, "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, because in the tendering conditions a global view of Collserola lacks: "There were 16 contests in the cross-cutting tender," he says, "on the axis mountains and sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
That, at least in his case meant that he participated in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors also collide.
In his view, the city should absolutely guarantee that the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length so, a soft transition between city and green zones.
