"In any aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the premium was the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and it all conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
It is a priority at the moment, the survey results as soon as possible, but it could take several months, maybe even a year.
For its part, has assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Aeropuertos y public Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and ancillary services in Mexico) that the helicopters from the Estado Mayor Presidencial premium air travel at the speed of the plane and flown to a soft Abhang had fallen.

Verstreuung the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
To date the information available suggests that the helicopter from gerader and seitlicher aufgeprallt direction.
The pattern of dispersed plane debris suggest that the helicopter with his unversehrten aufgeprallt structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion.
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of an accident can offer either on fire or explosion.
The latest survey results indicate several soil contacts.
In the studies were on site at a height of aircraft parts 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is a Schrägung abschüssig and points from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to rupture.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several soil contacts.
After a minuziösen search in an area that is on the field at the scene of an accident abgesperrten went dispersed aircraft parts could not be found, on the assumption that the-bodied aircraft structure on the ground.
