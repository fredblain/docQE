Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of the health legislation, adopts a court case
On the day when the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors in order to end the political part to discuss whether it is a challenge to the health law President Obama will hear, two of its judges, and finally there is Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, at a dinner attended by the firm gesponsort was that the case to court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met at a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases was a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have been adopted by Congress last year, a law that the conservative activists across the United States was the buzzword.
The judges agreed the hearing. Indeed, in March a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion, probably the result will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at a time when the court decision is announced, will be in full swing.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to overturn, will probably be Paul Clement, once Attorney General under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group, which is dedicated to the defense of conservative principles of law.
Another company that has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially in the outcome of the process is enormous.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had discussed the case in a Washington hotel.

The guests of Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The two judges attend events of the Federal society for years.
And this is not contrary to moral rules.
Indeed, to judge by the code of conduct, the actions of the lower federal courts.
They were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can Benefizveranstaltungen law near and other organisations to participate, with the judges no spokesman, guest of honour or according to programme a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity ranged from Scalia and Thomas on two of the case-related firms and companies with a massive financial interest in this to moral-and-government activists to alert.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the code belies the complaints of some judges lie, the court seems to play by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges and dinnierten won during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending trial on court."
Their presence and their support of a fundraising campaign for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little concern for critics who say they are legal matter too easily with groups that are on the agenda, such as the Federal society, mix.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
But the Conservatives claim that Judge Elena Kagan is a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance came to court.
Its critics have urged Kagan themselves from the hearing of the case because of bias because they too involved in the defense of the law is to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
