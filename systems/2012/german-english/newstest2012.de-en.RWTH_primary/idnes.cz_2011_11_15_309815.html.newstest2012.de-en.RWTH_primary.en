Experts say - a Stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how Stylisten learn, I had a little bit that it was a bit too much fuel for the start.
Because I was not at all, what is to come.
Lectures by three experts from the industry, the clothing and problematic characters and a seminar on how the "Square ."
It is worse to come.
The closer examination, the more information and practical challenges before us.
But even if the rate each on Saturdays and Sundays, he is nevertheless fully documented.
This time we debated with Director Ethyl (the rate is not a single man participating), as a woman who has no ideal proportionierte figure.
And these are, after all, most of us.
A have a short neck, the other a jungenhafte figure without proper curves and others are mollig.
It is a matter of Stylisten broad shoulders look better to extend the neck or conjuring up the necessary curves.
We also clues to how a type of women like Jennifer Lopez - with a great deal of Finland, a hip and thinner waists - attracts nicely and figurbetont, without being too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waists and hips is so great that really suits, the skirt or trousers should be at least a piece of that.
This will not regret it, because good sedentary clothing is simply unaffordable.
In such a tailor-made rock you feel much better than in a, verrutscht constantly high and, in the absteht waists, etc.
Jungenhafte characters can in turn, clothing with wrinkles, Bauschen, applications, embroidery or Raffung.
In this quantity of information and character types, I am glad that I have a whole week time, carefully go through the head.
And yet I fear that to create the House assigned task.
Each of the course was a celebrity, for which they should devise appropriate attire - day and evening gown.
Should we take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the stars and the type of type.
I should Miranda Kerr "attract ," which you may be familiar from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
Within juble I, because it is for me personally, much better than, for example, Britney Spears or attract Christina Aguilera, which has increased in the last time the hundred kilograms (never mind that this is a bit exaggerated), or the young Selena Gomez.
The clothes are we from magazines ausschneiden or on the Internet, print, and then deal with graphically.
In the Mood "Board ," as a result, then our personal style and our relationship to the graphic design.
It is also very important to reflect on the side of the graphic Stylings.
The Stylist model is not only physically, but also the so-called product page in the magazine (for specific target, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
It told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But the only on Sunday.
This means that a Stylist a good overview.
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday presentation was peppered from three visitors from the industry:
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way.
The magic word is variability.
For example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can but also on the naked body, (shoes to attract and hire him as a dress.
It is, the sleeves or the collar sleeves and, the whole look quite different.
"So," he said.
Most came to me but the following advice: "Think you know the rules perfect."
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.
At last, it is clear to me why we need to all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if on display in fashion journals often quite different.
Not to mention of fashion look.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options when he ultimately photographed.
So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared to stylen at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite differently than in reality.
With all of that is so in shaping the attire.
That image and Styl sometimes half the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
You need only to look at Madonna, not just a brilliant singer, have made the image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic is the services of Stylisten rather reserved.
Even celebrities often believe that this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I au naturel secondary).
And if stylen itself any of us, then we expect that he or she is likely a different (smaller) imposing size, as he or she really needs.
We need to googlen then only to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the celebrity have again or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario laid on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth "assemble" needs.
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
People judge without curry and, in his opinion.
"If any manager to sift through their clothes, and to complement beautiful pieces, then it does not remove the entire cupboard - my God, this is terrible."
"We must find at least a few good things, which recommends what to take it," says Mario.
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "pocket" must include.
So a bag that zuknöpft the waists and bears in all necessary Proprietäten.
In such clear terms, such as scissors, Abroller for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains Utensilien, as a nylon thread (thus helps the Stylist the photographing of products such as handbags or meting out from), specific clips, which tightened up the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.
So we have to listen to, but not only, but also can try something, we learned how to unterklebt shoes.
The photography studio, where the floor, can be destroyed the base, let alone the outside world.
Us o klebten and klebten we...
With the gap even affect the shoes are not allowed to, so that they are not damaged.
So we really have to be sent.
Mario enjoyed myself, my "Commissioner-delegate praised without restrictions.
This skill is not just my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we hear on the second weekend continuation rate.
One thing has become clear to me - the styling to address at a professional level, is not a children's game.
