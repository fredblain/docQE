Sister of Mexican President loses seemingly election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claimed to have supported the drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost its candidature for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. They claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, PRI, won the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and particularly yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls... You have occupied polling booths, road blocks built... And called on people to vote for the PRI []."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are seeking a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes for victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo beaten Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother, refused to recognise Vallejo winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which is currently acting governor, was ranked three, a heavy defeat for the split and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Also Aureoles refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers, and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specializes in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch in December 2006, the military's offensive against drug traffickers.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election while canvassing for Luisa Maria Calderon and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
For the PRI strengthens a victory party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan.
The man who will represent the PRI in the presidential race is is Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington congratulated and said: "I think that this victory makes us look boldly into the next year."
