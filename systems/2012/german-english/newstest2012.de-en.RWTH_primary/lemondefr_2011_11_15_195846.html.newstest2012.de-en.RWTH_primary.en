The CDU proposes that the EU president to choose on the basis of general vote
The first day of the Christian Democrats (CDU congress on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig was for Angela Merkel, German Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but has been held in the autumn, particularly those activists would be enough to ensure that the government policy with regard to the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates voted against only nine, ten had abstained from the vote.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, on the basis of their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble, a few hours later, the three European secessionist-minded Finance Minister no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor, as well as the application - following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "there are nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
The Chancellor is "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could come through the control of the European Union a reinforcing modification of the Lisbon Treaty on the budgetary policy of the countries in the euro zone, as could be, however, in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "to give Europe a face."
However, this is definitely one of the request for proposals adopted by Congress, which was clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 rapidly on this revolution: Great Britain is opposed to the matter, and the chief of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
The milestone is, however.
Also rejected the delegates in an overwhelming majority, the proposal of the weighting of each country in the Governing board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies, which would be an awakening of Germany's position.
To calm the climate within their party named Chancellor has reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. They did not, however, their Congress at the expense of "small" or in difficulties European countries to criticise the arrogant Germany.
As far as the importance of "Franco-German friendship ," calls Angela Merkel France devotes a paragraph on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it reminds us that Leipzig two centuries ago was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeats the Napoleonic army.
