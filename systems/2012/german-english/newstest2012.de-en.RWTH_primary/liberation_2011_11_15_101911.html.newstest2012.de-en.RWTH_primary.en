Europe has invented democracy, to rethink the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a sensitive material.
The European continent should remind themselves, who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20th century on the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of Holocaustes, of the gulag, but also in Franco's Spain, Salazar's Portugal, and the Supreme in Greece have had to endure.
Some were believed that it would be sufficient to exercise the right to vote, and is progressing possible way to democracy to prevail over their enemies.
We know since Napoleon "small" that it was a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage, the necessary condition of democracy, this is not sufficient, condition and may well become the "repressive instrument ," as it was at the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot."
No democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost policy and democracy crisis.
The change of the Greek enabling cardsharper referendum would have had twice insightful character in this respect: once the need for a strong return policy, on the other hand, but also those of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebrachtheit.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that have shifted to the front lines of the democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, no longer in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for the success of the national referendum, which was organised by depending on the needs and perverse sequence.
A free licence for European absolute ruler or a leap with in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizens.
No, we want to Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steadily, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one, moreover, was no longer know where to put an end to the list - because there is only one crisis, and that is in Europe.
It is an Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and rating agencies, which suffers from his powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is an Europe that is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about sovereignty transfers in Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which gradually loses its sovereignty, and each individual achievements nations.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project back.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans reduce the burden of debt, from the markets open and to build a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level on the condition that can be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, without us quite sure to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors, the Socialists for a long time, but today every European economic governance.
I agree.
But without political integration and greater democracy - as they have in mind - to the citizens, would be a folly and another impasse.
We need to take a new stage in European integration.
In France the Republic to arise, it took the fact that Republicans to "create ."
The revolution in interests alone could not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We must form an economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need to create Europeans to Europe.
