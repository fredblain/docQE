What represents the fraud in sickness?
After the family allowances are UMP and the government now sickness.
Nicolas Sarkozy will on Tuesday, 15 November arrive in Bordeaux to go to a family aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007 - always recurring theme of the fight against fraud, as well as social, economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the desire to put the economy in a tough test, on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, wants to focus the majority of workers sickness.
With haushaltswirtschaftlichem objectives: the government is seeking the introduction of a fourth day of leave of a sickness occurrence of workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of specific company would lose the wages of four days, at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper "Les echoes" anger threatens to provoke would, however, to EUR 280 million.
And were accompanied by a different measure rather symbolic nature: the state officials unvergüteten day of leave in the event of illness (so far there for them, the Gegensatze to the three days of leave in the private sector, no minimum period).
Meanwhile, these issues in the debate, the majority also of the issue of fraud, and this time aimed at the abuse associated with labour shortage.
"Checks will be much more important, and there are rückzuvergüten, if requested," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, 13 November before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this news about the reality of fraudulent actions seem a little unproportioniert in the areas of sickness.
This is in fact, already since 2002 under constant observation and political campaigns, which have borne the most fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, the first nationwide paragraphs.
According to the country's sickness benefits CNAM were paid out in 2006, more than 237 million daily.
According to the Institute of Economic Research and Documentation of health care, the daily compensation in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health spending.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and accidents and 54% on sick leave, i. e. EUR 6.2 billion euros.
And so, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010 the French were granted to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group on average only 14.5 sick days.
Midway, covered up the differences: a, in 2007 by monster. Com, a website for career planning, was published, showed that 75% of the 40 surveyed 000 individuals French workers, not a single sick day.
Another, this time by the health insurance, study makes it clear that 37% of the sickness in 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% were between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% of between one and three months and 11%.
Compared with its European neighbours, not the French workers more than elsewhere to incapacity.
One in 2010 of two researchers of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (disease or otherwise) oszillierte, and in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% the United Kingdom, or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sickness is a tiny proportion in terms of undeclared work.
The fraud is achieved only a weak levels.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002 means that there is systmatische controls on sickness, which exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public school for education and training of technicians and engineers) noted below 1.5 million checks that 13% of 285,000 of the past, short-term sickness, which in 37,050 cases, "unjustified or too long."
In the systematically controlled hospitals reporting cases of more than 45 days duration was under 1.2 million 11% "unangepassten or unjustified" cases, which is 132,000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 cases of "unjustified" several million workers who have made use of a sickness occurrence.
A paragraph, which represents only a weak levels such as those of undeclared work.
According to the UMP MEP Dominique Tian, who in July published a report on this issue, that is between 9 and 15 billion euro tax loss of earnings per year, i. e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus far more than the Defraudation last.
