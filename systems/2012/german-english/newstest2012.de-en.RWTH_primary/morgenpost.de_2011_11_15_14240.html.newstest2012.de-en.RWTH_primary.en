Intelligent Krähen broad in cities
Many seeds Krähen as a "problem birds': But in the cities are highly intelligent animals no longer, experts say.
Some of the other, they want to get rid of them quickly: Krähen, for centuries to the city, but in many local residents are mounting complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a remedy for the problem "birds" not yet in sight.
Let saatkrähen to get out of the cities no longer, experts said in the first Krähen symposium in ostfriesischen Leer.
There, experts from the entire federal territory on possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists said the problems in cities have also led to the countryside of overprotected seeds Krähen: destroying chemical use in agriculture, increasingly traditional habitats.
The hunting, springing up, and the cases of typical nesting trees, the birds.
Krähen are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples there, in the Westphalian Soest, West-Nordic in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and Leer.
There was a controversial project to 2005 mass killing of Krähen in the district of negative headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of animals in bird traps and clubbing with truncheons described as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, Vergrämen futile," said the city and landscape designer Werner Klöver from Leer.
Nests with water wegspritzen or trees, often have unintended consequences, said the environmental expert Manfred emperor from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals from, large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Vergrämung is only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we are no longer away."
Without the periphery will not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from Leer.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen of the animals from sensitive residential areas and bait advertising to resettle them elsewhere.
"Infotafeln instead of chain saws" was against the psychologist and Ethnologin Undine-Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals: "One Pickel Finally, in the face, we can confidently endure."
In Schleswig-Holstein jürgens had co-founded the ash Berger Krähen teaching path, inform the notices on the lives of the highly intelligent seeds Krähen.
The project has already adopted by tourists.
The of the birds" criticism of the noise Jürgens has had its own opinion: "there is plenty of communications, have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seeds Krähen not only use tools to get a biscuit, but as a tool of their tool even themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge quiet recently four seeds Krähen to what extent the intelligence of the birds.
In one experiment the birds quickly learned that they must bring with stones a structure demolished to a Mottenlarve.
Without much training they have the size and shape of a stone, the platform collapse.
In a second attempt to solve the smart Krähen then a kniffligeres problem.
In a vertical cylinders had the researchers placed a small bucket with a Mottenlarve.
With the beaked birds could not achieve their prey.
However, the researchers had made them wire.
It shaped all four animals a catch, which they then the bucket in the grip of the tubes.
Three of the four seeds Krähen even at first sight.
