Asphalt from UNAM prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
Would the message emanating from the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in Zona Metropolitan Bishop Ana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if it were the travel and the maintenance of Asphaltbelags, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
In his lecture "bumps from a technical point of view," he said on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible for developing with Polymeren modified Asphalte to produce a similar mix asphalt, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
Mr García-Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, for example, some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of the low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface typical zähelastisches behaviour.
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that the high temperatures approaching 180 ° C behaves like a liquid, it is very viscosity at 120 ° C and 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures.
"This is not the resilience of the Asphalts on the road uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations ," the chemical engineer.
The researchers said the FQ, the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface from six layers of material zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt.
Between the upper classes is a layer of asphalt, from small asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
Each piece this decay class, had been sweating in asphalt.
If the vehicles themselves, and generating forces, this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better," said the chemical engineer.
"On the decay class," he tells us, "is being interpreted a final class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, sweating in asphalt.
Since this class in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the wear-and-tear class and they must produce friction.
The road surface receives most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and material from which it is, must be maintained.
The weather conditions, in particular, moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the decay class significantly.
If the was wet, water in the class and only difficult. This caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and, consequently, the incidence of blow holes.
If there is a pothole, "he said," will first of all the deck flattened class, while the decay class afterwards, but the damage was not immediately affected, but it is a process, at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
Which is a member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores Nationales Research System (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the incidence of blow holes, so must the thickness of each layer of the surface are always in relation to the vehicle, and it must be ensured that in order to frequent blow holes this regulation will be met.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many research to achieve, for example, Asphaltemulsionen who are in other countries already on the market, and the potholes and repair without application of high temperatures.
