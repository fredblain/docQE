Trade union for carers because of a complaint against the city
The union, the hundreds of workers who have lost their jobs last month, is planning to sue the city on Wednesday, as the redundancies on the grounds of undue influence on the schools, the poor students, are not necessary and discriminatory.
The complaint is probably the last chance that the union, District Council 37, in their efforts to make redundancies, is still open.
Sechshundertzweiundsiebzig school helpers, care coordinators and other staff, who are among the lowest paid employees of the city and on 7 October in a move had lost their jobs, union leaders have described as political revenge for that last year the city's access to a health fund, which had the working groups, had refused to close the budget gap.
These allegations were rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the City Council, Dennis m. Walcott, director of the schools, last month that the redundancies were part of the budget that was adopted in June.
A member of the council leapt back and explained to him that nothing in the budget spezifiziere that the school aid workers would be laid off.
Officials of the City council in 37 said that they have warned the Ministry of Education in a lawsuit on Wednesday there will be a press conference to announce the date the case before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally announced.
The complaint, mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the city as a defendant and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all coloured or Latin American women, like most of the workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice, said that the city would not be the case, and therefore could not comment on their individual claims.
According to a lawsuit, which is of the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of redundancies in schools in poor neighbourhoods of the city to support a complaint alleging discrimination, claiming that had lost poor schools more workers, because they are chronically underfunded.
It states that, while there are no redundancies at Staten Island and few redundancies in schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school aides in District 23 in Brown's Ville, Brooklyn, and have been laid off 46 workers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South raspberry.
With the loss of five of eight 36 school personnel in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, "This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents who can organise the donations to offset budget cuts."
P. s.: the budget of the 36 Javan was reduced this year by 3.26%. In addition, funds have been lost, as the city changed its method of calculating the extra funding for any Armenschuleneinschreibung.
The union also complained that the head of the high schools with the language in a memo, which authorized the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the act, even if "excess': transfer) in the United States usually the exchange of teachers on the payroll of a school in a pool of available workers who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty six care coordinators, not handed over," says the complaint.
