Park or mountain?
The architects, in addition to the disputes about the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on 16 doors opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980 s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitan Bishop Ana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even in figures compared with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and bottom (Sea).
The classification Collserolas as a natural park playing with this idea.
As a model was no longer the Central Park, but yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.
So far as it was, as the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates after Collserola.
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.
Either that, or someone at the gates to the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city as a topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste who meet in the elevator, can turn.
And it is this fact provides the fuel for one of the rare common ground between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "frontline" in the mountains, "the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.
"We should start from the principle that is the park overlooking the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex, "judging the architect, for the title" gates of collserola "a" "is in itself: they must not" imagine than access to a park, but as a narrowing of areas where action must be taken. "
Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge ,"" some risks ."
Risks as a result of the "uncertainty, which entails the creation of a public space today" after the experience from the 1980 s in the field of Forum had their "swan song ."
The first fear is its own limits to what can be developed.
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e., to cross.
"We must consider a new urban planning instruments, because the current [regarding the plan General Metropolitan Bishop Mariano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, keeps close to the matter, says that the side of Collserola towards Valle Sana, "can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage de Collserola, not the "should fall on deaf ears ," although he was grateful that it has given his body, the possibility of this project" from the outset ."
In addition, it says that the proximity of the city of escort letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he has expressed his "doubts" about whether this technical profile which launched multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says," We should architects should only be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tendering conditions of Collserola lack a global vision: "there have been advertised 16 competitions in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountains. But there is no Längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety."
This has led at least in his case that he attends the 16 championships.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway would clash with the architects of the Tors.
In his opinion, should guarantee the city that is the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, which is a soft transition between city and green zones.
