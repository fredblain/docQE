Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in the defence
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday, as he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security. That set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts $600 trillion or more necessary if Congress could not reach a conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to a 23% across-the-board cuts and an end to a large number of new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out on such ill-considered manner, would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to separate us involuntarily by a majority of civilian staff and that the reduction would be implemented as quickly as we would almost certainly civilians in order to achieve the objective."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
The cuts were in the combat troops, "said Panetta.
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect," Panetta warned the serious interference in the budget war efforts.
"Staff have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war, would lead."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would be a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are strongly against these draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they Panettas letter published.
"This is a result, we cannot live with, and it is certainly none that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly outspoken said the possible cuts, although he has many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister a gloomy picture of what could be a military - with skin, but without a core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"There is an air squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is an armed force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential adversaries."
"It can be a really angry."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crises, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global commitment and response capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
To this list also includes the Fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Coastlines Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, Army and Navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
It would stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say that it is an important next step toward rearmament, so that potential threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted.
