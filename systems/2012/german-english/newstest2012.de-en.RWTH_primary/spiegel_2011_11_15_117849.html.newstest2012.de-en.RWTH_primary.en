21 s house in Vienna
The umgezogene pavilion
By Mrs Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups and downs and happy ending: the Austrian World Expo pavilion was 1958, prices of Brussels in Vienna to the museum, was empty and descended.
Now he will be considered issuing house reopened.
If modern architecture, dreams of clear, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical of the faith to technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Expo 1958 a striking and well-known example.
Schwanzers pavilion at the time the Grand Prix d Architecture for his easy, steel and glass construction.
The construction has, to date as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He also made the architects so well known that the Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built.
With his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus schüsselartigem subsidiary building in Munich in 1973, he became internationally famous.
The planned construction of a temporary exhibition pavilion set up after the world exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, rebuilt and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20th century opened - the "20 s house" it was called. "
It was the buildings but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, the contemporary art in Vienna a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came more and more.
Now has converted the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, he is now "21 s House" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opened the museum Belvedere, one of the House, where the first exhibition - a fortune in every respect.
Through the restart Agnes Husslein Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein Arco, solicitor art historian with considerable career including the youth than Eiskunstläufererin later Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the museum of Modern Salzburg, the restructuring strongly among politicians and the monument conservationists, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and put the use.
No contemporary art should be issued the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a bookshop, and there should be an office House had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation was then Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him a "tremendously important" was the place where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.
He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
In the current reconstruction there was far greater problems: the building was an Energieschleuder, "says Krischanitz."
The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glasfaserverstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Kältebrücken steel sources have been replaced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets were rescued.
Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old rotbraunen rust-protection color tone.
And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before.
The memorial authority and all this under strict supervision and with a small budget.
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the monument protection office did," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in the underground missile.
Despite all the constraints, problems and building the building remained flexible and easy.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "dropout in the City history."
So an architecture "always in the wrong place" and wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21 s house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke occurred: the Swiss garden just completely new planned "Central Station, office and residential accommodation."
And another stroke will happen: the 21 s house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin fizzled art hall, and we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.
