The scandal Bank of Zürisee
The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS in the financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next.
Now it is going to be a German.
It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was revealed in July announced that he would make 2013 an almost equally spectacular new job: Board President of the big Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland whether their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kept warm comments about the future.
"The UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September it was clear that everything would be quite different.
A trader at UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and found some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to leave.
The President of the Board of UBS, also damaged - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber?
The bank was already known that Weber from February 2012 to discuss.
And the administrative presidency assumes he already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber will be hard.
It is not a banker, an economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just shown once again that they have long been deserves the title "biggest scandal bank in Europe ."
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss wealth manager had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
On the one hand, the UBS 2007 managed to high-net-worth customers with $1.6 trillion more money than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it was as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks late.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent longtime banking analyst Hans Geiger counter in Zurich: "Do student I have portrayed the UBS was regarded as a model of good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How did I do wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, for the first time that something was wrong came in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising hochintellektueller in the meantime, as well as ingenuous bankers.
A few months later, suspecting he was gone.
The investment bank had been with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to cope with the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
So it was in fact investors, but what about some until shortly before the face: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that they did not even have heard his name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008, there was worse.
The bank had to be new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid Board Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 was followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin the bank.
The whole country was shocked, because they said, as dramatic as it is for a small country, if it is so large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"Once again we could not save UBS ', says banks researchers Geiger counter.
The first disaster joined the second.
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America, agreeing to publish the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank.
They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and criminal charge.
Thus, the UBS more or less open to help in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was not Swiss banking secrecy.
It followed the resignation of CEO and Board President.
And the exodus of customers" money.
It had lost the bank within months its credibility in two main business areas: in the investment banking through the false speculation and asset management assistance for tax evasion.
And, just as it has been somewhat calmer, just as it was thought that now will get the UBS it again, because this is An unfortunate traders history: An individual traders found EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something was wrong.
And it appears to be: the risk management in the investment banking is obviously still did not work.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control too little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial management of a large German bank is sure the UBS: "the problem is that it has no risk control."
Was it just the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers for a long time ago, guardian of the major assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - but also collapse across the Alpine republic in the world.
The Tresore Swiss banks have become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is only a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road that leads from the main train station in Zurich directly on the sea, flanked by the summits of the Swiss mountains along paths.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers as Tiffany's here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks: by the National Bank of the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius bear.
The reception hall of the UBS boards through a revolving door.
Inside, the walls marmorverkleidet verge thick leather armchairs, alongside the bank logo is a great sign for the "safe ."
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually betrayed - or, as the head of a small Swiss private bank.
His name he would rather not read in the newspaper, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks.
The UBS had become too big, he finds - particularly in investment banking, where would spread the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its only high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On 15 October 2008 was a disaster.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition of small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Luke Hässig in his book "the UBS crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion approved politicians, in order to save the large bank for the from bankruptcy.
How did it happen?
Talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks a huge corporation.
It was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Switzerland - and grew still further.
It helped that supplemented the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they could a huge wheel.
Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger counter.
"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who has heraufgearbeitet from the bank lesson to the top."
But Ospel have to rely on Wuffli finish.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger counter.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: embolden came in the case.
The leaders of UBS clearly remember the meetings at which company chief Wuffli purported to be the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the "League Tables" rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.
Then the UBS, according to the top.
Some steps were their success.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she played at the top.
Business advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international interest in the business, bankers "fixed-income," there is a huge gap among the world's largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS in an adventure that almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, the bank invested both themselves and their seats of hedge funds in American subprime assets.
They became a huge machine that securities on American mortgage loans packaged and passed - but also risks.
Also, as other banks for an exit.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market in flames, has bought the UBS there," says banking expert Geiger counter.
The euphoria so great, so deeply.
A manager after another had to go to clean up the attempts were more difficult than expected.
Items in the UBS were to be used as a weapon and are still shaky.
Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which are all obvious business models.
Bankenforscher Geiger counter has an idea: stop the investment-banking activities, focusing on asset management to return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank is not (yet).
But that investment banking is to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
On Thursday will present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Swiss was intended only as a temporary solution, as the bank surprisingly from predecessor Grübel.
Now he has won: it is the business of UBS, told the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to roll back the investment bank in the mid-nineties.
He renationalises 3500 posts.
It will not be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What they want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
Publicly he says only that he would seek with his wife at a home in Zurich.
Next year.
