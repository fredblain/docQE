On a personal level, mass slaughter
Sensitive and generous begins Peter Englunds new book "beauty and horror: a story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main persons to heart.
A tip on how to proceed: Cut off the side of caution and make it your reading.

Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for literature.
He has written an unusual book, not incorrect describes as "a work of history ."
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles, there is little ambassadors, racing reporter or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he says, but rather "a book about how it was." it is about "feelings and impressions, experiences and feelings."
"Beauty and horror" almost the wartime experiences of 20 more or less discreet men and women on both sides of the war, ranging from school girls and Botanikern to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people are heroes.
Some will lose to prisoners of war, limb, crazy or die.
Each of these lives faint as the Votivkerzen in a church, some, while others fade away.
Englunds book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrected the idea that the First World war was just devastating position war on the Western front.
"Beauty and horror" with experts on other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Ostfront, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are bees baskets, a celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a very moving book almost from the outset.
The lives of these people flooded the war as a natural disaster like hurricane Katrina, which reeks of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with their children, and cannon fire in the distance, you stay or you take the flight?
Who is at all?
Hardly anyone understands what happened or why this war at all.
"The lack of facts ," Englund," with assumptions assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours. "
"Beauty and horror" individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard root, a young German ship sailors.
Their stories were mainly memories from letters and other documents already material.
Their reports can be frightening or simply of life, but they are very vivid in Englunds loses in details accumulation of small moments.
Many of them lack and butt Behelfen act.
In the story of a German school girl told him: "replacement, everywhere."
"Ersatzkaffee, wrong aluminium, false eraser, paper, wood buttons."
He tells more of the spare Essen in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and Hammelfett was cooked (and most recently with a false bone from wood), tobacco, which was made from dried roots and dried potato skins, shoes with wooden besohlt."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered food spare funds that were allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitute."
Some stories act of honor and bravery.
An American acknowledges his own drive to the ferocity and says of the war: "It feels that despite what was envisaged for men rather than to sit in the Lehnstuhl, with the evening tide or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in my hand, and to pretend that such a veneer of civilisation and there are no barbarism behind their own strengthened and keeper shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier, that he would probably die, and no one will notice or care.
"If one of the idea to sacrifice themselves, you would think that this is happening in front of a crowd," he writes.
Instead, it is quite as horrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations from the old Europe falling apart, and on new types of terrorism.
"The conflict was becoming an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He starts the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the young century ": the word" looking and ideologically committed mass murderers in made-to-measure, slaughtering them, while he sits behind a desk. "
People behave in unexpected ways and there are equally frivoles behaviour as civic-mindedness.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to becoming infected with a sexually transmitted disease with a prostitute in order to escape the front line service.
"The grotesque, which can be found in the trade with Gonokokken Eiter, because soldiers and grease on their genitals, hoping to come to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate, rieben him in the eye, which meant that they were the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves will Englunds poetry elastic but intrusiveness and fits perfectly in his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he the way, "as the war unleashed on unique way uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People start to wonder why their leaders to the fighting.
The best books about the First World War were usually more distorted as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarques "nothing new" in the West as a comprehensive history books.
Englunds band is an unconventional glorious hall.
His book has the most devastating end, which I have ever read in a physical book.
I am not there any more.
But it is as if he snapped up with his book this side of the main people in their faces and lit with a match.
