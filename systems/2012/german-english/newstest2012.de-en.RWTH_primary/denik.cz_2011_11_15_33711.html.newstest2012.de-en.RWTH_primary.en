Development of the travel prices since 1989
By 1989, the then ČSSR only five authorized government travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agents sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were only chosen at the time.
And so, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary workplaces.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and so the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
A great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he took a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not individual trips.
Even then, travel agents and travel in the West, but then had to be huge queues in, or spend the night in sleeping bags in the travel office, or at least "good friends" in the travel office.
So was not the cause.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not umtauschbare currency freely without foreign currency, it would have been impossible to the necessary financial resources (Western currency) find for a trip to the West.
The journey most Czechs spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that bought the Czechs countless weekend homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
A huge paradox, is not aware of it, is the fact that the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90 s, the foreign exchange duty in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe lifted, above all, what a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken could not get for a long time to travel to the West simply enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days since.
So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a length of canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades were able to buy our tourists Western currency.
Our standard of living and, consequently, the average salaries rose to what einmündete 1997 in another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by chartered flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.
At the end of the 90 s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment with all advanced countries in the world, making travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, when the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - after Thailand.
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development, came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, which our country is definitely among the world's advanced countries brutalized.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time, more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita.
