The General Assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR) will be even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.
To date, there is still no agreement on what is to be elected electoral law.
And this is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to come together and find a strong personality could run the football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two associations chambers again able to agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, as the new leader should be chosen.
The delegates at the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
We could not agree about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutory representative or with a power of officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in power base is not admissible.
The dispute over the election law, however, continue to take.
The Executive Committee did not have more clarity on the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
Even if the views on the election a few times - the worst point remained the same.
The question is: how can we in the 3 st round in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the FAČR, representing management in professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the one candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech Republic, on the condition that the winner of the other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"We have the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would put the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of Moravian side that it would be best, not tweaking the electoral law, but to elect under current statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
"It is my wish that largely elected under the statute."
"So that no unreasonable ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (the clubs) Victoria Plzeň, particularly Pelta abgrenzte stood for the first time and in his opinions.
Pelta but remains optimistic.
In his view, the new chairman Nymburk known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football until the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience, both on a professional, and regional levels.
Rajchl is more circumspect.
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
"It is a new block in the General Assembly cannot be ruled out."
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides.
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generals until qualification at all.
The charter plane, fly, inter alia, Dalai boron Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice, was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all, and so was urgently for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee on the venue of the Barrage Hinspiels.
In the end, then surely the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to come on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education in the country's divided parties within the largest sports associations would have liked to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of Czech football and also the forthcoming General Assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate is
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballer before the extraordinary general meeting a strong candidate could make that all his ideas on the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR) had met, he would not discuss it at all to the battle for the top position.
"If there is a good candidate, then I would fight for him and abandon the election."
"In the current situation, but failed to find such an Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík into duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, it is to prevent the alleged favourites for the election, Pelta, at the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he only if he wins the role of the chairman a year, until 2013, until the date of the proper main assembly.
In the position of chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in football events.
"I have personally spoken with some of the people in question."
"Hard to believe that some said they wanted to identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all disturbs Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's link with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association novel Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of the chairman.
"His victory would einkonserviert and the Czech football is not making any progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a cleverem Business Man, the football twice as bad," said Paclík.
It is also important that Pelta's name was made some time ago in connection with phone taps to the investigation in a corruption affair came from the Pelta but go unpunished.
"I do not know what the victory of Pelta (tsch.) should play football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, its previous formula, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman" looks a little more calmly.
Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta well.
Just think of another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I am putting my nose in matters of which I understand nothing," said Paclík, who had been in September that he was behind the resignation of the Commission with referee Luďěk Macela was at the Dagmar Damková.
Paclík claimed, he felt the role of the chairman of the association.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the League.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to the cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which turn up in horrific situations ," Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities, the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"This is one of the key things that should be addressed by the new chairman."
"When it comes to the taxation of luck games, such as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, they must also be clear where the money goes," he said.
Its link to the Pilsner club does not Paclík also as a handicap, although he emphasized, the chairman of the FAČR "bipartisan ."
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"This is not ideal."
"It is not my opinion but also a lot of sense to transfer my shares in the club Pilsner hypocritical to a third person to return after a year and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the post of chairman, Miroslav Pelta, if elected, he will ensure that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law.
The official from Jablonec before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk confident and believes that the campaign would defuse a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds.
He decided at the last moment, to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, and so did help him the two-month pause to defend his ideas on the running of football and in a broader context.
"People at all levels is devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee.
This is also why he says that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June approved statutes that were not perfect, as had all accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman, "said Pelta in September.
The review of the most important document of the citizens association he used as bait for the delegates.
"I should be president, I take myself personally, and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not."
"This is a matter of principle, without which it cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to differentiate themselves to his opponent.
He had earlier announced that he could cooperate with Jindřich Rajchl imagine recognizes the because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy.
Also Tomáš Paclík, he has been for a long time, which in turn, no dry thread Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"The attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"So many doubts about his true nature," Pelta addressed his opponent, who will probably be his proclamations to which he expressed in September.
In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
"I would try to put an end to all Affairen - the issue Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
"Immediately afterwards I would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
At the time, he promised that will mean his arrival at the tip of the Czech football staff cleansing.
"I would like to start with the job content of all employees," he said in the direction Strahov, where is due to the length of anarchy understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk in vain.
"If that is really the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come."
"Football needs credibility and he is the only way back when he finally has a new leader" remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the work of FAČR below him hard begins
If the current deputy leader Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, would supposedly frenzy that many people in the club's whim.
Rajchl promises that in the case of his election promises to work hard.
He wants to introduce changes and the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to turn to the football as a whole."
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, the professional football, to the football for the youth. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would distribute the competences of the executive committee that deals with each member pays a certain area."
And I will be distributing hard tasks, so that the football in each segment with. "
Moreover, many not just delighted because, instead of only to criticise the work of others, now itself should begin to work really hard, "he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered no longer to run.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, not me constantly spanners in the works, and every step I am in question," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others."
"It is trust must not squander it," he said.
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work that he has begun under Hašek.
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I do not want to throw away now."
"Processes have been launched, the only in a few years to come, and I would hate to see that they ride," he said, and hereby expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Miroslav Pelta, could return the situation in the days before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not."
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I can be some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I don't want football for all, because it is all very well, and not just a selected," said Rajchl.
He also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part, the winners in each of the first League visited."
"It could not happen today only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the battle for the post of chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me," led Rajchl, saving tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the fact that the association is not a single hymn sheet.
While Pelta he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence, he believes that the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate to the football really does have something to offer."
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue with things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change."
He would certainly not things in its favour altered want "judgements Rajchl on his rivals.
