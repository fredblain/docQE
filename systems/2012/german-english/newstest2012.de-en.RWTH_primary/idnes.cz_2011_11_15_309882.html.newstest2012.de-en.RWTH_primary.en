V Need for steroids: "The run" - The illegal race across America
Recession
The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, dilettantish error on a routine trip to the class.
It was, in large part to fulfil the ambitions, but what is the point when obviously had no desire to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part, with the subtitle "the run" high expectations.
He promised that the able games series" Need for steroids" in a new dimension to postpone and the spielbaren examples to demonstrate he seemed actually to be not only one of many Action Rennspielen.
We were also curious to know how the eingepassten passages in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But how NFS is so accustomed to, in essence, is much different than we had expected.
Sure - are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but will reduce the risk of some unnecessary mistakes that are in this series more or less for a few years.
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather in principle, signs of incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
History will be in the first instance, whose main character Jack introduced certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, set the wheel - with the task to be first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual race.
This means that every race with each other, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting environment.
No one has the impression that the game would offer the same.
Some areas are still very attractive, although the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the trip through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
Occasionally bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, is surprised by a desert storm, which reduces the term.
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful step that will not be buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle a classic race), it has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single counterparty.
And this is also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaving the car.
It is more about some interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing from anyone and where he must help the players, he is the right moment the right button.
So nothing complicated.
Surprisingly, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (actually only three).
Ultimately, this is the case with the advantage, because it has this element at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game sweeteners.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
This means that from today's point of view, there are no trees, on the other hand, could not be said that it would be bad.
Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren the European Fahrmodell continue quite well, although it could be found in the competition.
Until then, everything is peachy.
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
Unlike Fahrmodell is not the collision model quite OK.
This type of a game is hardly to be expected that complicated deformities and collisions calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea as to how the car, then obviously not everything is in order.
Case in point: the close do so or those driving to oncoming cars "scratches" on the other cars only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but went into a tailspin, and wild pirouetting.
Or the Karre to scrap.
Thanks to the rest of the system makes nothing, annoying is it all the time.
The rest of Arts are resolved that, if it has destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference.
Only - in every race has only five rest of Arts.
If they have been exhausted, everything is starting from scratch.
The rest of Arts, rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we prefer not to rely on.
Sometimes helps but not the rest of nature, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves must pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy.
Elsewhere, the relevant department "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but until you arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must slow down or avoid it.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again regardless of the time.
The Madman Estonians, this is at the end of the game in the long bridge in opposite direction.
The Kontrahent must clearly hell bent on overtake.
And if he is just a, then it is, of course, the point of view, so we drove there initially by car a few times in Klump.
Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and more exciting but it is clear that spoiled them quickly the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler Fahrmodell is aktionsgeladen the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes so that we do not know almost more, where one of the head.
And, in principle, no matter what "responsible" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can avoid boredom, or something else...
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race.
We must not overlook the petrol station on the road, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the alternate motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical operations, such as the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the way the game's history is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the premises of history.
There is not only medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to reach a higher level, drivers must be different items, ranging from cars to the Backgrounds for the profile.
This is linked to the online function Autolog at the same time, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation last race in history.
Here is one with the car in a subway tunnel (I), where desecrate kept in the dark on the rail for (or).
On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km/h (or), but it is suddenly from behind a subway and a drive to scrap.
In our editorial will argue we probably still have a long time about whether a blackout of the game makers, or keep the authors so stupid.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases, appealing and sometimes even brilliant.
Even more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slows and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this is in particular the accidents with greater number of parties, where a continuous FPS useless anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.
In a bid to such a broad scale as possible rather young audience, created a Sound Track a lá "from any something" - but anyone who buys such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for steroids: the run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not offset by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have of conviction can claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game somehow unfinished.
For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye.
