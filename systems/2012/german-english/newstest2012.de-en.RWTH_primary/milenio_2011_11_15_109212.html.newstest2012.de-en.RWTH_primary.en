A bailout of Italy with a public debt amounting to 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the EU's current rescue package.
Monti has said that his government until the next elections will be held, probably in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
