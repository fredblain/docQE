Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
They wanted to look for a suitable word that characterized the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
For the general public is IBM synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although a century has passed since its establishment.
The basis of this longevity, already presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas j. Watson.
Already he considered the slogan, countless were easily solve global problems, if people were willing to consider a bit.
His slogan "Think!" was the brand, the lives of future giants should take place (and at the same time, the title of intra-group magazine which IBM in 1935 began).
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture.
"For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also an entire century, because it has remained faithful to its principles and not shied away from everything else around it.
The allowed us, in the course of the first century, the technologies, the business and to transform the society.
We hope that we create in the next hundred years or more, "said Samuel j. Palmisano, the director of the company on the occasion of the anniversary today.
Educational system
Watson was already in the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the company Baa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
As more sophisticated IBM's long-term relationships with their customers.
The company was brilliant in the talent from the outset - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, will invariably the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.
It is thirty years by IBM, have so far adopted the position of the Vetriebs, head of marketing and strategy.
IBM makes in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which stem many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there is no shortage of ideas, the company employs is almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their strong position in the Business guaranteed the company a strong image and after internal and external.
"From the beginning, IBM, the concept of an institution, rather than a mere technology company," said the Economist, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that the business problems through technology helps solve," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself, there is a difference, to be on the market only present or molding him through this presence directly.
IBM - in the states of their logos for family "Big Blue ," has grown up in a century to one of the largest companies in the world.
It is one of the militaries developed technology companies - IBM hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible breadth of products - ranging from servers to nanotechnology.
Most of all American technology company IBM patents and five of his staff were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Among his best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or diskette.
With approximately $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization) was the second largest technology company IBM in this year (after Apple), and for the first time since 1996, Microsoft obsolete.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations, the tastes of the customers of today - were unhappy with its own operating system, for example, the attempt OS / 2, the online service Prodigy or the computer IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, should not be emotionell tied to the past," says Samuel j. Palmisano.
It has no problem, to build its ground on various platforms - and if they are not going to leave it.
Unlike the opponent, Microsoft, which in principle with its Windows operating system.
Ie technologies
In the profits of IBM participate to the greatest extent services, software and hardware to participate in a fifth.
It was still 1990 hardware with a more than fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000, IBM veräußerte little profit without assets worth $15 billion, at the same time, however, it has invested $58 billion in buying promising technologies.
In these investments continued IBM after 2008, when swept the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept the world.
Here too, IBM, the legacy of his first boss Thomas j. Watson, the increase in the midst of the major world economic crisis his investment.
So far, it appears that the company survives IBM today's crisis.
The value of the IBM shares rose since 2008 raketenartig at 120 percent and the profit of the company is growing kontinuell.
IBM's corporate slogan is: not everything can be changed - only the values.
Also, to be expected that resolves this flexible giant the next crisis.
