Boeing is attracting record of $18 trillion in country
Airline two-track Emirates ordered 50 Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 additional aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It is a rare news that a company a contract on 50 of its products.
But it is a great deal if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co and the list price for the 50 aircraft will be a record amount of $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is the customer of Boeing, the Middle East, growing gold mine of future plane orders.
In a forecast, published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East over the next 20 years, 2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-track Boeing 777 jets.
The gavel mission came from the Dubai airline Emirates.
The airline has also announced Boeing 2011 at the Dubai air show, an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, the entire lists price to $26 trillion.
On Monday ordered according to Boeing, the so-called Oman Air six Boeing 787 - 8 Dreamliner, the vastly improved fuel efficiency and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is running at more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Internal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
So they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in oil prices, which is usually the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so bad, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important, because it is less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The order from Emirates reaffirms helps Boeing's leadership position in the market for large aircraft and to keep the rival Airbus SAS, which attacks the supremacy of the A350.
Boeing's victory at the air show comes four months after Airbus announced that it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777 - 300 ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence, called the customers a higher burden of farm and reach.
The Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
