Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people to such a high level?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today marks the beginning of the 15th week of work for the disabled. "
Despite the purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people always twice the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No, stressed Éric Blanc Franchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the" week of work for disabled people ." "
"The within fifteen years are considerable."
"That was not the unemployment rate twice, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed are still many obstacles remain before they get a job.
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the "form the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
The underlying implication that mentalities, certainly, but slowly.
A in April by IMS Entreprendre for the magazine La Cité study, which surveyed managers have "a weak level of disability," the "over-represented" "persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually well-off."
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked to collect contributions from companies that flout the law.
The proof: the number of "fees" zahlender plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and in number from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement is also a real awareness especially among the large firms groups."
According to the Ministry of Labor employ only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees compared to 82%.
