Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week is an important hearing on whether 28 men and women charged with failure to intervene in cases of rape in the military court.
If not, there are hundreds of plaintiffs ready for the next hearing.
Obergefreite Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and in the 11th week pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldiers at night.
It was in October 2008 and they returned to their barracks in Mira Mar north of San Diego back from dinner with a friend when they met at a male colleagues, one of the 12 s, Pack beer.
He asked whether he should accompany them in her room for a drink.
"My alarm went on," said Lyman.
But the Texanerin premonition aside their concerns.
I thought: "Oh, no, he is 19.
He is from Texas, "she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they had gone to Lymans Zimmer, the man behind them, put them down and they were raped, it claims.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officials anxious to a process with a historic hearing Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a complaint against the former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, made in court.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld not against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional right of the soldiers.
In February by Susan Burke, a lawyer in Washington, d. c., the complaint initially 17 claimants, but rose in the following months at 28:25 women and three men, who all claim that they were raped by soldiers colleagues or sexually abused, and that the military failed to identify and condemn or an appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attack. "
Burke says that they had the top military leadership, because the problem there.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation to the leadership."
Burke also says that, since February contacted nearly 400 other survivors, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Their strategy: instead of all the claimants lay their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, many more complaints in order to maintain the pressure.
The team of defence for the Defense Ministry, led by Federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has submitted a request to reject.
The files of the court, Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, first and foremost, that the military cannot be prosecuted for violations by current or former soldiers in the armed forces.
On the basis of a law of the Supreme Court in 1950, the so-called Feres doctrine, is not the government liable for injuries inflicted on active service.
"The alleged damage during military service, the plaintiff," the document says.
The Defense Ministry denied any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950 s.
If women are still not allowed to work in the fight, the distinction only in name: modern wars have rarely clear-cut fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, particularly in contact with indigenous women in war zones.
The result: between these two wars killed 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in hostilities.
It is time to modernize the military, says Burke.
And it is not alone in their struggle: three further complaints except their are pending.
At Yale Law School, the veteran "Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four main military academies because of alleged promotion of a hostile atmosphere.
This independent, non-profit Vietnam veteran of America a lawsuit against the military, in which the "personality disorder" diagnosis, rape victims received for them to be dismissed from the service - a standard approach, according to activists like Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Their group filed in December complaint against the veteran administration, management of the war veterans), in which they accused their discriminatory practices in their dealings with entitlements for people who have felt, have been sexually abused in the service.
Nine laws was submitted independently by a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties in Congress, which offer a number of leads.
In 2010, according to the sex Assault Prevention and Response Office, Office of Prevention and reporting sexual abuse), the Department of Defense 3,158 sexual abuses.
But most abuses are not reported at all, according to the Pentagon's own estimate of this number approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases occur each year.
The report, which was published in March, also investigates the prosecution rates: 2010, 20 percent of the cases in the military court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case reported the alleged rape of the military police less than a hour after the attack.
On this night, she says, they have been asked 11 times, the details of the rape of a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and the blood of their aggressor, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge during the hearing she was asked about the sex they had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people said as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read out," says Lyman.
"I thought the trouble would use. I ran screaming from the courtroom."
"They brought me to the psychiatric ward and I remember that when I came back to my commander said: that was not his procedure, which was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to go to a military psychiatrist, who ultimately a personality disorder diagnosed and dienstunf√§hig said.
In January 2010 she was dismissed honorably, so that they receive no support.
Whether the complaint, the Lyman and the other plaintiffs have submitted progress is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of law at George Washington University law School.
Nevertheless, it says: "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that will, since it was the first time in question.
I am always a critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military has lagged behind a decade because they do not possess the same incentive and deterrence, a liability.
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it is important for them to try."
These things will change only when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing will not follow their path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, with its hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will fight the military in this regard, pending reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
