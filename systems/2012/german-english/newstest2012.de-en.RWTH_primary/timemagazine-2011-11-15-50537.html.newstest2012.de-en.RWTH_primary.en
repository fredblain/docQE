Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, the only one of many boys who signalled their anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has committed a killing spree in Norway in July to have killed 77 people, its first public hearing in court.
Despite Breivik, may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack at his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But, as we find them?
This is easy - you just have to log on Facebook.
"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklop√§disch, says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply advertising tool of the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - do as retailers for years.
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups in Europe and visierte them with Adds, but rather with a new band or to connect a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, was asked about their attitudes toward violence and the their own future.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - not just once her office had to leave.
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results come as little surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to be a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and policy researchers use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes ," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, generated Facebooks "data supernova explosion" a research boom, the number of scientific work, with the name of this page title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook that can be achieved by the people who do not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to first inform the party and would never have access," says Bartlett.
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve.
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problem drinking as students who remained silent on this issue.
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, residential advisers to help monitor the side and a student if they too many status updates.
"They can't solve a problem, if you have not recognized," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co- author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute of the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
Facebook also zapft constantly data of its own population.
The data team has statistics on the types of status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and produced a national happiness index (which has been used primarily according to the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long understood that should make the their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) 
But the users of Facebook that the side they are, whether they like it or not. with a friend, is thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side's own personal data sown.
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know about?
While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, everything is permitted.
"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public pages of students on Facebook.
"It was just them and their friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in an user profile and in speeches.
"What you on Facebook and what outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as a technology researchers that are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk to real people," he says.
"Social research must address the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."
