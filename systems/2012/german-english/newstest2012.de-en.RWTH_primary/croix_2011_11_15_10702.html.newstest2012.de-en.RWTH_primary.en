Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and the Western Europe directly links with Russia, was put into operation.
They should provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with pomp and ceremony.
Over 500 boardroom, including four leaders, attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the sea directly.
The German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolischerweise Russian gas tax Ventria's films together, which to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas per year through a pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the region St. Petersburg Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, supplied to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, amounting to a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is allowed to be completed by the end of 2012.
And it can be referred to the possibility of building a third pipeline along the route.
For Gazprom, the timely and pinpoint completion of this enormous provide as a victory.
The project was controversial in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will make a direct gas supply to Germany, while avoiding any route, through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to contract access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not shied away from the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new Franco-German sowietischen pact" in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin in order to compare the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of the Russian project an even greater security of supply.
But at the expense of starvation of European energy, because the project a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years Russia has managed to bring his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and their gas run out.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, by pointing out to what extent are the large gas contracts of political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile in Lugmin number of Gazprom managers regarding the Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel and concrete shelter to protect them from Schiffsankern.
It rests on the seabed at a depth of approximately 200 metres.
The building had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"As hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," Jens Müller, spokesman for the society Nord Stream.
It had to be taken stronger measures to protect the flora and fauna.
The line is a long queue of metal, difficult as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing, either through valves, or maintenance stations.
A control platform was off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained from, as the Swedes have little eager, a Russian state company in a permanent way to match its coastal settle.
"In the event of an accident contract we Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," clarified Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak leaks in the pipeline and gas in the air.
In this case, the designers, however, than just unlikely, since it was estimated the sweat completion of a consistency of a leak per 100,000 years.
The government's monitoring of the gas pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater robot will to external surveillance purposes by a sea, as well as a device that circulates in the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, attaches a metre diameter, will be introduced into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of moving through the pipeline at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformities of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to function for fifty years, without the slightest undergo repairs.
The Gaszirkulation will simply by pressure.
This is 200, 100 in cash to the access cash at the exit.
Five companies have united to achieve this project their forces.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Attached to the German companies e. ON and BASF attached (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie group GDF Suez, the French companies (9%).
These five companies have formed a business community that Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It is located in Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is particularly good.
Gazprom has the entire capacity of their Gastransportes hired out then this society, and on renewable twenty year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how big the real from transporting volume," clarified Jens Müller.
The financing of the pipeline construction was at 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to EUR 7.4 billion for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, the investment, for example, 240 million.
The minority shareholders are sure to recoup their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The pipeline is a sandy, with pine forested coastal strip Lugmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 metre high valves are the Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors measuring pressure, temperature and other indicators of the gas, arrive before transferring this in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas verstreichende per hour.
At full capacity would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and $6 million in 2012.
