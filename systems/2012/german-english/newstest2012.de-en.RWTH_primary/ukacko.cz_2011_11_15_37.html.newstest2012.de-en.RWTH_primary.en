EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of Negativisten and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of kilter."
I would not expect such a hard war flares. "
"It will take five to six years, until the dust settles and we have all become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her lecture at the law faculty.
How seriously it takes the motto "Verständlich and openly about Europe ," they showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of the University of Karlsruhe might envy.
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism that he is too low-key - a grey officer, was incapable of such a role, but I must say that it has brought all the time, as well he has taken up the cause.
"He is a person who is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently, communicate with and has particularly clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number to I call? ," as an important step towards integration and better visibility of the EU's Policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, the of the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
The Czechs had handled the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The case of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a major negative, which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador said, it was not only the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet quite hectic.
And it must be approved the seven-year EU budget, which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget, which will take precedence which countries more or less - all of that is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "Verständlich on Europe."
"If I do not, then it know acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How should I know as citizens, whether in Brussels or round really curly cucumbers and variable bananas dream if someone really wants to ban the Quargel.
They had used the soil of the EU, in order to get more Czechs in European institutions.
Europe of two different speeds or in prospect
The EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be Eurosceptics, the more the negative than positive sides of the issue.
Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write letters and motivation, the weak support for the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency emphasised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, believes the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is once again your V4? "and it makes a pretty face acid.
Mrs Vicenové according to the EU in the future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute, fully cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that should cooperate only the countries that want it and those who do not want to stand aside."
"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "Mrs Vicenová expected.
In this regard, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU by all member states, and only by the countries of the euro zone.
