Troops feel compassion rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala, collected millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a Ballad of helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, collected hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in black Smokings stood up and applauded.
"The servicemen and women were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organised the fundraising effort in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, among other things, chief of staff and former chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen was observed, the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I am sure, the organisers have meant well.
I know that.
But there was no respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and of the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members.
The public is increasingly behaving as do the people in uniform.
"We were not victims," said Brigadier general Sean b. MacFarland, the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it is the only way of support, to put us in the role of unfortunate souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive for military leaders, not the ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve, want to appear.
They have also recognized that the anger, the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War, was far worse.
As a result, there are discussions about compassion in the private sector between breastfeeding and war veterans.
After his two sons have returned from fighting with the marines, the former Colonel Mark Cancian, they warned that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would consider them with a sense of awe, since they defeated rebels and travelled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "angry, violent veteran beneath the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and has taken a senior government post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the interviewer subtly, whether he is able to immediately after his return from the pressure of a demanding post in Washington.
"If you talk about your service, you must keep their negative impressions about it," declared Cancian his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is rooted in the lack of interest of the Americans in the war.
Services on the battlefield will be in a country that has little experience with the military, and sees little value in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, singled out only rarely.
"We as a nation value military heroism no longer, as it was during the Second World War was absolutely normal," said Lieutenant General David Barno admiral, the U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of the politicians and the public mostly on the suffering of a service members.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends who have lost their job or for the severity of their injuries.
