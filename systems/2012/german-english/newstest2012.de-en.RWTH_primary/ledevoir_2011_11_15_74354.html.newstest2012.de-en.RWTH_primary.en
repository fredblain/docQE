Euthanasia and suicide free death to be legalised, a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada says
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in an attitude towards the death.
Only 9% of Canadians are in fact, to talk with their doctor about conditions under which they wish to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a magnificent report by the Royal Society of Canada, involving six experts in various disciplines, including ethics, law and medicine, are interlinked.
This body recommends the government to amend the criminal law, in order to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where this election, and in patients who are considered to be in a position to make such a decision.
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent society EIU, who had compared the death in 40 countries of the Erdballes.
Although Canada has placed on the 10 th, the study noted that "the medical Sterbebetreuung in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to bring up the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians have no access to painkillers, tell us the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the overwhelming desire of Canadians to die at home, however, 68.6% of those in hospital.
The whole country, the rate of 86% in the hospital deaths occurred in Quebec.
In the sensitive issue of euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, the authors of the report's conclusions that the position of the federal government, which has already said, any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and begleitetem suicide, illogical.
But now there are, according to the experts who have inspected alike all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization abuses in its application, would lead to the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide unkompetenten or not consenting individuals.
On the contrary, encounter a lot more cases of such violations in the countries that are not legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, a signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is illegal in Canada, where they are clearly."
"Suicide suicide is practised in Canada, although clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia
Let us remind ourselves that had already carried out in 2010, according to an Angus Reid poll said 85% of Canadians in favour of euthanasia, since they are of the opinion that this would allow people at the end of their life journey to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that was not the issue of euthanasia, to convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people less value.
Regarding the persons who already have an assisted suicide, representing 41% of respondents to the view that this should not be prosecuted.
As for maintenance or suspension in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, as the authors of the report.
Similarly, in its recommendation list that should be stated that the criminal law that the dumping of the funds, which have been a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel of experts also requires that should be trained health care professionals in the duty to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of prosecution.
The panel said that governments, health care institutions and doctors worked on schmerzlindernder treatment, in order to provide the best palliative resources, and also about the cancer cases.
Finally, the body of the Canadian institutions for health care, far-reaching means of pain relief or lebensabschließender measures used at least to consider, because this is neither as euthanasia have served to reduce physical pain and spawned in the same procedure.
Reservations other experts
Some legal experts in the field of health care have reservations about the conclusions of the experts" report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Council Pierre Deschamps, specialist in health law, has the attitude of the berichtsunterzeichnenden experts described as "extremely ," among other things, because of the practice of euthanasia practice in hospitals in the final stages of any borders.
"This opens the doors for a situation in which everyone, lebensmüde and more than 18 years to ask someone else to help him in his suicide," RA Deschamps, who had looked through yesterday a summary of the report.
Council Deschamps stressed, the authors of the report seemed to be the responsibility of the individual over all other values that are involved in social fabrics of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, one-rule-for-one-and-one-rule-for-another health law, also has a "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which they described as "per euthanasia manifesto" not long ago.
Margaret Somerville, who is himself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts, in particular, the report claims on the failure of abuses in certain countries in which legalised euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
