What was missing the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors is that Melina Ramírez Serna the crown of Miss Colombia is not.
EL Valle receives his 14th misstitel.
Once again, Valle del Cauca empty in the awarding of the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time had to be Melina Ramírez Serna content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the band, a new Miss Colombia, to them.
With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar, has joined the Americas at 14 Miss title and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had kept the crown almost. Among the Misses proclaimed: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question facing many today is: What was missing?
The decline because the result is a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain, the Queen of the police and the Mejor sandbanks Jolie Vogue, who had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor is seen as crucial for the jury's decision to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "which book has influenced you the most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta litre Arias Leamos was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca the questioner replied:
"I read a lot, I quite believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book that shaped my childhood," the Little Prince ', is a very deep.
At the moment I read "crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal culture that we should read it. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, "passions'.
A response that was met with skepticism, firstly because of "civilise" and, secondly, because they do not specifically how each of the book they had improperly.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "the universe is wise, it is what has to happen.
And for all people: please read a little bit "The little Prince '. it is a great book.
Among other things, that is out of love of El Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the Priority measures that all Beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously what stresste the Queen, who could not shine on the stage."
And that, in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and two lifts during the coronation ceremony.
Although she appeared safe, lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, not ultimately Queen '.
It was at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie could not convince regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the National beauty contest.
There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty for Miss Colombia alone is not enough. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social sense, that they are already participating in the competition had worked on projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, said her in the stomach area, had sinned, but this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán said, is that Melina did not have the best body that there were better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the stomach, for me, honestly was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should get it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
Because of this prize, the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing suit a cruel prediction, which should be in the middle of the night. It was getuschelt that had been Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they enjoy the crown.
Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their for a year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.
However, it will be one of the queens, who had escaped despite their overwhelming outburst of Cartagena, go down in history.
