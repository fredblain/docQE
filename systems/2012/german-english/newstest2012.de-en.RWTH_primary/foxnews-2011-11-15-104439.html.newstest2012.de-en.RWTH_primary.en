Controversial plan for a pipeline will be revised after exposure to delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened the approval of a proposed oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and at the same time to delay, which the unions angered environmentalists, is that the pipeline would provide companies sought to plan the project so that we can return to normal.
Trans Canada said Monday evening that will reroute the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of trans Canada said that the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course, reviewed the area of Sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major water supply, a smokescreen.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new Umweltüberprüfung, has ordered the Foreign Ministry, may defer a decision until 2013, after the elections next year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task for the State Department and said his support.
The 1700 -mile pipeline, linking Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
This would have to pass through the pipeline in six states.
Environmentalists they hate, but labour markets love it, because they appreciate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas who are against the plan, if the laws, a departure from the region of Sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the main auditor of the Ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was stopped by Trans Canada, Paul Elliott, who was 2008 adviser to Hillary Clinton, is mired in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company contracted to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice, as it is with trans Canada.
