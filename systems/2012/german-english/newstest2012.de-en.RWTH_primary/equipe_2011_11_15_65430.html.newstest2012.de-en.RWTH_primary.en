Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento provides for the return match against Bosnia with great optimism (22:00 p. m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The Hinspiel had two teams lacked objectivity.
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already faces in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not even the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his National Eleven, for which he has since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
For Portugal, in fact only 90 minutes sanctuary.
But it is to play a match, abzuservieren and an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that has not yet been decided.
Portugal dominated the game clear about more than a hour, but the team was not able to put the matter as important as it would have taken up the pressure.
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese, before an audience that will be as much of the game to get by, even if the game, of course, as a "very close" was announced, said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We have to continue to have a 50% chance in the championship in 2012," watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to achieve a goal and to win.
A draw to the Bosnians, who also have a goal, already.
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor" regrets Bento.
"We are up against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "admit they have no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that they will be implemented in practice.
