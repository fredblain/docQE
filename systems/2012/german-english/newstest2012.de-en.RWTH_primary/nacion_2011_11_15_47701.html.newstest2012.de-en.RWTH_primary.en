More than 20 years, they have been expected, but the band rest assured that it is a dream, if they play in Costa Rica.
The assured the Bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, Viva last week by Brazil in an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate twenty years of its existence, and on Sunday, the 20 th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they occur at 19,30 pm in the National Stadium, together with the band the X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation, whose full copy in the online edition of La Naci√≥n.
For Costa Rica's fans realised a dream if Pearl plays jazz jam in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
In Costa Rica to play is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time that we play in South and Central America, and so far it has been great.
I am only once, on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country that we will remain there for a few days.
It is exciting for us to bring our music.
I ask you that because the fans of the band. They are flat in the days before the concert.
What does your begeistertesten her fans?
Thank you to all these years on our side.
We have spent almost 21 years, until we have arrived in Costa Rica. Thank you, waited so long to have and we are very sorry for so long, until we got here.
Some people even believe that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Is it not a bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows that we have made over the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that have made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Indeed, we have to play there.
We love this country, we are happy to surf, and the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
As you know their Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend, and I have a wonderful friend who lives in Tamar Indochina, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always went surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico are excellent places to surfing. In this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned from it.
With an eye on the tour have offered their giant shows with many songs.
What plans you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Because that is where we never played, we also have no borders.
We will try to provide the best possible showdown with many different songs, we want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
She repeatedly your repertoire.
Why?
I believe that this is partly because we have nine plates and can play about 120 songs, like every other song, so that the decision, which we each play, is not easy.
If we have two or three songs that we have played no longer, into the repertoire, we can protect our focus better and they surprise us, because they the reasons why we have taken these songs. Otherwise they could be it.
This makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates your twenty years of history.
If you look back at you find it hard to believe in your success?
Yes, completely.
First of all, I believe that none of us has presented once in a great rock band to play, and also for over 20 years. It's like a dream.
We also continue to this, and it is great to be able to make music together.
We can and we are thrilled to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to travel to the places in the world, we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you, attended the birth of the Grunge actively to have?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large band.
We are good with the people of Sound Guards Mudhoney and Alice in Chains friends.
It is surprising and rather unusual, if it is a movement from a group of friends.
Occasionally, a band from a city, but it is unusual, if five or ten groups simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud and feel honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play still together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Sound Guards on their tour, we are pleased that still to be friends with them all and it is a credit to us to be part of this Seattle Sound that have arisen.
It is also very unusual that zusammengeblieben a band like the with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us play have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron), 13 years ago. this in itself is a lot more time to survive than many bands.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and also we care about each other.
We are all close friend, why have opened up musical, which give each individual's freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and its music, and it could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other side konntet their thanks to your success always do what their Yugoslav.
As a balance?
The way in which we have grown, has made it easier to find a balance.
We are sure to be not too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music to go.
As long as we think that the people because of the music, it reminds you that you are the music and what it has created, must be careful not to be determined by a famous rock star. It has never interested anyway.
What memories you have of your project Mother Love T-bone?
I believe that we have very good songs written at the beginning, it was great.
We were a band for three years, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) had never issued a disk.
We were disappointed, for so long. We are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), with the band, a friend of us, when I hear a song or see photos, I think what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to work together to laugh and talk about music and football and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, especially Eddie Vedder, you have chosen and the band for the opening?
Yes, the production of videos of several groups and the band liked best and that is why we are curious to see what Las Robertas can offer, which will certainly exciting live.
Why does the text of yellow Ledbetter whenever it plays live?
It is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing he can offer.
By whom got influenced you as Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to come to mind include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, c. j. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I all afternoon on Bassi, I liked to talk about.
As Pearl jazz jam has managed to keep the Grunge alive, although it is no longer a fad?
I do not believe that we all feel very attached to the word Grunge.
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others who, at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive.
The two came to tears when I heard how Ed they played, they are very dark lyrics.
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embody the clear for me.
However, I also believe that a happy man and can put dark music.
