Plantschbecken in Ufo optics, "pools in Budapest: anyone who travels through Europe can be nasty shock - rest and after a Tour cities or relax the tired legs in Sprudelbädern.
A book that shows where wellness in the water in the most beautiful.
If iris Meder in the past year and a half years on research trip, was not one in your luggage: her bathing suit.
Rücklings water, it is high in artfully shaped cupolas, they swam marble Putten, they waited on the side of the basin, and was amazed about meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
Did her a bath, they, in their note book - including wissenswerten details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 pools various fact-finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her book "bathing ": popular swimming halls in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest," hard-core concrete buildings "in the region.
By 13 countries, their "trip to the most extraordinary dipping in Central Europe: Germany, Austria and Switzerland, they visited sites in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathing culture Enthusiastin.
With sport do not have much everybody says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoying only swimming fans with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while jogger can listen to the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern inhale or happy in the mornings in the park.
"One day I asked why must be swimming pools are always so ugly," says the Meder living in Vienna.
"So I started to collect beautiful baths."
Water surface doubled architecture
Geplätscher jump in the pool and sauna essential oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because it all sense, Meder.
And if the builders, can be a real Augenschmaus swimming halls: "Instead of a soil has a water surface bathrooms."
"It is clear, on the one hand, reflects on the other hand, but the beauty of the whole building."
All doubled it looks: high vaults, colorful Kacheln leap out.
The kleinformatige picture band "bathing pleasures" is 190 pages of value of knowledge about architecture and cultural history historic wellness oases - but above all an appetite for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Sammlerin Meder with her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent salvation dipping such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in an urigen Karsthöhle (caves in Miskolc Tapolca), as well as a spa bath, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water and are in a flaschenförmigen buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, on the other hand, many free unoccupied Spa in Switzerland and Austria: During the Zurich roof of the entire city, you can look in the external pool of Bads in the Bads in St Anton along paths Arlberg - and: steam bath, there is a window that can be seen on the activities of the ski runway.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expected bathers in length field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a particularly in the Alps gelandetes Ufo.
Three open-ended bowls dampft in the winter, while those in the background, the mountains of Ötztals stand in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool, the pool Sammlerin Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smelt of sulphur in Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells so strong after fuel oil, which is difficult to believe that to be landed in a bad health.
The smell comes from the alkali hydrogenkarbonathaltigen water, it is almost black and of silt a skin once you slip into the pool - a wellness experience the special.
In one place was disappointed iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites but also: When they wanted to visit the free and sun in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, it was an abgesperrtes terrain.
In 1902 by the architect dušan Jurkovic was now closed.
As Meder a glance through the window verwitterten yellow, red and white youth style building, they looked like weeds between the tiles.
The decline has countered, however, in a boy from swimming in the Black Forest: the Palais thermal bath wild bath.
Three construction schedules, this was already behind him, can detect not only neoromanische elements from the time of its establishment in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra style, which was added in 1900.
Since the 1995 thorough modernisation is the Palais spa's favourite swimming pool of knowledgeable iris Meder - and not only because they originated from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement, various Baustile to such a great unity," says Meder.
In such a palace is the Tauchgang in the thermal pool appear to be beside the point.
