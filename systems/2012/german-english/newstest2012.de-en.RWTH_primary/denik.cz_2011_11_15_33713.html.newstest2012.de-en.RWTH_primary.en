Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion knows about their losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now, to define the winner.
As this region, win in the elections Islamists, the only question is which - the moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council, the customary law, which is now a certain idea of God.

It is rather strange that the Muslim fighters from the infidel dogs help.
In their defence, may serve only the fact that NATO's bombardments by any General from America, but by Allah, was hailed the omnipotence of every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We were only in a shooting incident, served the interests of Islam and our politicians getting in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without any benefit.
After the fresh and bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we saw more of a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen a concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
The oil companies but also without occupation black gold to the silver?
Hardly, and so can the West finally have the right to boast his selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not spoil the Scharīʿa representatives.
