Immigration is a burden or opportunity for the economy?
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticized for a variety of angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of the figures submissive policy, this policy with the status of a "country of human rights" as France had branded themselves.
Recently, the harassment against foreign students of regulatory side, the interior minister had the weeks look passing (see Libération on 23 May) announced that it has "no talent, a bricklayer or waiter from abroad is needed.
But this policy was analysed only rarely from an economic point of view.
There is a wide consensus on this issue between right and left.
The right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including about 2 million immigrant workers, should be no problem for a country," from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had made 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumber was shared in 2005 on both the right and the left.
Both camps were perceived the immigrants as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference in the level of generosity, and is willing to admit the immigrants.
Francois Hollande is limited in its programme on trite to point out that partnership development will allow it to our "migration" problems to solve.
This idea of immigration as a burden, an issue that can affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book in mind, the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus exists among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Limit immigration would weaken growth and labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threaten indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace, putting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are more complementary than than the local wage workers, because they are jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet arbeitsplatztechnisch.
The low skilled immigrants work in sectors that indigenous wage workers, the higher quality among immigrants working in dynamic sectors in which the training is not in line with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect

In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants miteinbezogene long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9% herbeiführe.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas put forward by the immigrants creation and is conducive to economic growth (high proportion naturalized immigrants under American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute to net the social systems, in European countries on average in excess of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, at the age of 30 years after Germany sea person the public budget, on average, about his life a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of EUR 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start of his mandate, the lack of contact points "with the teeth."
The question, which should deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
