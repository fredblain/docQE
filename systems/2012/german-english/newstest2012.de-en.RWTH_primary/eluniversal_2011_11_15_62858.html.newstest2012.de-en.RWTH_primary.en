The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details about the plane accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and another seven people died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (secretariat for communications and transport in Mexico) informed that the results of the inquiry about the accident, in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people were killed, point out that the helicopter with his whole intact structure directly on the ground, without the pilot would have been able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference earlier Dionisio Pérez Jácome, the secretary for communications and transport that would have confirmed the pilot before the launch, the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel 25 metres altitude contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the rump, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several contacts soil."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, and he met all the conditions for the transportation of staff.
He also said that the investigation in the area, which was decrepit machine, there was no helicopter parts.
"In the search found no aircraft parts found in other places, the premium was on the whole structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the conditions for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority, the results as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
In turn assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat) for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico that the helicopters flown by the Estado Mayor Presidencial in charge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information reinforces the assumption that at the time of the collision was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference was the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, six important points that should be taken into account in the investigation.
Visual flight:
In line with the standards was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that we should have had the team during the flight and ground sufficient visibility.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico state took some deep low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that selected the team because of the clouds lower area with better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Aufprallstelle:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree. It might be before the collision with neither a loss of control on the plane, a deviation from the flight route.
The remnants of the plane were scattered in a limited area:
The until now available information indicates that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from unmarried partners and seitlicher direction.
The pattern of the plane scattered debris that was aufgeprallt the helicopter with its intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the plane at the location of the accident to offer close to fire or explosion.
The latest findings indicate several soil contact.
During the on-site investigations found aircraft parts to a height of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is abschüssig and has a Schrägung of seven and thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to rupture.
Some information indicates that the helicopter could have had several soil contact.
After a painstaking search in an area that transcended the shut-off area at the scene of an accident could not be found scattered aircraft parts, which reinforced the assumption that the caring aircraft structure on the ground.
