MSS announces a research protocol to the discovery of the gene for obesity in
It is Mexico's social security fund a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which is supported by the IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano - IMSS del Seguro Social (Social Security Institution Mexico) announced that it is a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title "genetics of obesity in childhood and youth" is to be found the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, the head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Division for medical research, focus biochemistry) in the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI stated that a multidisciplinary team consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to participate in the study, interested parties can come to the sports fields of IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8,00 am tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports venue of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) began, and since 8 October at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México) will continue.
If the target of 500 to 600 people, the study achieved at the sports venue of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and the continued Moreley (in the north of the capital district).
He said that the aim of the study is the understanding of factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the anniversary of the diabetes worldwide, he said, it will seek to three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14 years with the consent and under the supervision of their parents" nutritional questionnaires.
You will also be asked questions about their physical activity and their family medical history, risk factors, which could have diabetes or kidney failure, to control.
He also said that, as measured by the so-called Saturdays investigative persons (weight, height, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (the identification of genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this would take place at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain in young people.
"The health surveys from the years 1999 and 2006 that had increased in nearly six years, the proportion of obese boys at 77 percent of the girls with obesity at 47 percent, and the obesity has risen dramatically," said the expert of the IMSS.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because of differences in the genetic history of the Mexican population from that of other peoples.
He stated that a (e) Mexicans (in) to 65% on average indianisch American, to 5 percent to 30 percent of European and African descent, reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he said, the genetics of obesity in the inability to press the surplus to us of energy (calories) to burn, so that it will be stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said that the direct benefits for the participants, in a comprehensive study of the children, which would be whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the of a different skin wrinkles in the neck and arm of the Interior (Akanthosis), the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage, investigated.
All information would be kept confidential and told the parents in writing by the doctors, the doctors tell the parents all measuring results and beat them with lifestyle changes, which are for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz said López, there were three fundamental factors for being overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, lack of movement in everyday life, to spend most of the time of the day in front of the television and transport to go in for short distances on foot.
The high caloric intake, in other words, an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Standard (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), together with a high fat and protein intake and genetics in this research project is to be analysed.
