The worst female vices: what's with you?
If the men to mention some typical female vices, then shake them all some promptly from the sleeves.
The women, you can see in the following pages, in which a few Unsitten review, the men's blood in the veins?
Einkaufssucht
Her husband to be einkaufssüchtig?
You have to buy at least one pusillanimity every week?
You like to go shopping, and it must be a little more in action?
It is in your case really is a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping mood reasonably under control.
But hand on heart, that it has to bummeln not in search of a good front upper clothing only through a clothes shop and all (in every possible colour combinations) test in the booth?
Even if it is shopping for most women a hobby, for men, it is often the pure hell.
They have to see how often she said her husband - you prefer to stay out there...
Permanent discontent
"I am not too fat?"
"I should be at least five kilograms - should I start to go jogging or Gymnastik?"
"I liked you?"
Is familiar to them somehow?
Yes?
Then you belong to the women, who are truly obsessed with how they look.
This does not necessarily mean that you should go, but many men allergic respond when their woman constantly whinges about their appearance.
The stronger sex is agreed - with increasing frequency of complaints are women always unverträglicher.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows clean sweep, tiles and dust, scheuern the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Grumbles you with their partner because he again with dirty shoes to clean tiles trample you chastise the child, because it is gescheuerte washing basin already bad, because the glass door in the living room cabinet again fingerprints, which the of so much trouble?
Should you suffer from this kind of "Devianz" suffer, then you should know that nothing can exaggerate and the order and cleanliness in family life.
This excessive Reinheitsfimmel can ultimately hurt the mutual relations and, above all, the rest of the family.
Enjoys taunting
"Dirty Turnhosen in the laundry basket."
"You want to attract the old socks really tomorrow again?"
"Not simply a watery towel, on the ground."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised to see him at the Palme.
It is not so bad, they want to just that everything is in order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not quite so much to grumble.
Schmoozing
Some women clap and tratschen like this is behind the backs getuschelt or even slander or forging alliances.
Women are focused on relations, panting like issues, such as, for example, - who, where, with whom, how and why.
I think any of us has a bit of harmless schmoozing at camp.
Hand on heart, that is all women.
This is not to be confused with gossip aunts gross calibre, which nobody and nothing is sacred, which are all around them, and especially for women's collectives a significant danger.
