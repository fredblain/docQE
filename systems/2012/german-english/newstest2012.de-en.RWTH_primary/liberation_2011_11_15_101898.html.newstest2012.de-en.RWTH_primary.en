Energy policy:
Facts about dogmas should win
There is a matter that is not be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of, this is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and the competitiveness of businesses.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as a reason to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only if they explored the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data footing.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, will have to a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time to alleviate the shortage of fossil resources in order to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from the environmental debate lost subject, forgetting to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore blebt Germany remains isolated in its decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which makes its decision, the need to find a replacement substitutionsfähige source, even in Switzerland, the barely intends to build only nuclear power plants in the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against continue with determination.
The United States have decided, after Fukushima to connect their park another unit, using the following the nuclear accident in Three Mile Island plant back in operation.
Even if the on renewable energy sources, German model is presented as a model, contradicts the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, by the increased use of gas imports increased energy dependence on Russia, in particular, an increase in the gas and coal-fired power plants, CO2 emissions.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is on the one hand, European leaders in wind energy tables, from which it takes 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, used in rotation with wind energy; so are its CO2 Ausstösse and its electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy pay our neighbours a contrary to our French households higher electricity bills by 40%.
Because the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key element of competitiveness and stability of the industry on national soil, the French companies on the basis of the cheapest electricity in Europe an advantage.
Any significant reduction in the nuclear power would therefore a strong increase in the price of energy, which is the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of illusion.
Polls showed that a price to pay is the vast majority of the French nor prepared, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policy of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125,00 direct and 410,000 inferred jobs.
Due to its strong export nature brings with it a host of small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and makes these creators of countless jobs.
Should France to take a decision to withdraw from nuclear power, it would be the most of these SMEs, and the annual 6 billion euros of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would wither away more and more.
The electrician would work at sixty years designed EPR, if it is inevitable that the decline in its producers?
In order to solve the energy equation, there is also a little like a devil a miracle cure for producing electricity.
Developed by the company Areva, low-carbon solutions for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy are testament to the complementary nature of the energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a security authority, the clear and transparent controls in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
The working teams, who have made a name of their professionalism, the security idea just obsessed.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has seen three serious incidents.
Only one in Three Mile Island happened is under normal operating conditions; so he was without consequences for humans and the environment.
Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, causing human error.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of several thousand people.
The nuclear industry will learn the lessons from this accident, as well as they did so after the two previous.
As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and manufacturers of nuclear power plants, the EPR draft, which enable resilience in the face of such phenomena.
Under the electrical engineers is deemed desirable, to build a nuclear power plant, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition of Areva and EDF liesse by giving them free rein to the position of leadership in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate, looking for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible, emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber a debate, the equally determined with economic, social and financial situation of our country.
