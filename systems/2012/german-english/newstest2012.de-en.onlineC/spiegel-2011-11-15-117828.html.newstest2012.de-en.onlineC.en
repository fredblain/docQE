Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue one
Of Julia Stanek
Paddling pools in UFO-optics, splendor pools in Budapest: His blue miracle can experience who travels through Europe - and rest after a city tour or an excursion the tired legs in mineral baths.
A book shows where Wellness is most beautiful in the water.
When iris Meder in the last ones went one years on research journey, one was not allowed to be missing in their baggage: their swimsuit.
Backwards on the water lying, she looked highly into domes formed artistically, it swam towards marble cherubs, that waited for them at the edge of the pool, and that was astonished above meticulously restored youth swimming-halls.
She liked a bath, it matched flugs into their notebook - along with details worth knowing about the design and history of the building.
Architecture historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and she imagines now in their just appeared book "Bathing-joys": Nation swimming-halls in Munich, historical bathing-palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete constructions in the Taunus".
Through 13 countries it led their "journey into Central Europe" to the most extraordinary baths": Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland she visited places in Italy, France, Czechia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungarians, Romania, poles - and in each case a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year old German is a true bathing-culture enthusiast.
With sport she does not have much at the hat, says Meder - only in the water that is different.
Annoyed only, that swimming-fans must come with blue tiles and chlorine stink to terms, breathe in the beguiling fragrance of spruce forests during jogger or can listen to cheerful bird chirp in the park.
"I wondered one day why swimming pools must be actually always so ugly", says the Meder living in Vienna.
"Therefore I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Ripples in the diving pool and ethereal sauna-oils - the Wellnessfaktor in baths is therefore so large because all senses are operated, according to Meder.
And if the builders have given themselves to effort, swimming-halls can be one truer eye feast: "Instead of a floor one has a water surface in baths."
"It is on the one hand transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building, however."
Everything doubles optically: high vaults, colored tiles, springboards.
The compact picture book "Bathing-joys" provides things worth knowing on 190 pages about the architecture and cult prehistory of historical Wellness oases - particularly fancy for a jump into the blue one does, however.
The pool-collector Meder discovered remarkable copies at their investigations in Hungary.
Next to splendid spas as the 100 years old Széchenyi-bath in Budapest she found some nitrate-containing waters in an earthy karst cave (Cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a hot spring whose basins are filled with alkaline water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand offer spectacular prospects many heated open-air swimming pools in Switzerland and in Austria: While one is having the whole city in mind from the inhabitant of Zurich Dachbad, one can look into St. Anton in the exterior pool of a bath on the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which one can observe the driving on the ski-runway.
Badegäste expects the maybe most extraordinary pool-design in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO landed just in the alps.
From three to above open shells it steams in the winter while the mountains of the Ötztals into the sky are jutting out in the background.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the odor increased to the pool-collector Meder from chlorine into the nose.
Many hot springs smell of sulphur, in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so strongly of fuel oil which one hardly believes to have landed in a health bath.
The odor comes of the alkali-hydrogenkarbonathaltigen welfare water that is almost black and that mud sticks to one to the skin as soon as one makes glide into the basin - a Wellness experience of the special kind.
At a place Iris Meder was also disappointed on their search for beautiful bathing-places, however: When she wanted to go to the free and sun bath in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a terrain shut off.
That 1902 designed by the architect Dusan Jurkovic meanwhile Bad was locked.
When Meder flung a look through the weather-beaten windows of the red-white-yellow Jugendstil-building, she saw how weed proliferated between the tiles.
On the other hand one counteracted the decay in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: to the palace Thermal in bath wild bath.
This bath already behind themselves has three construction phases; one can discover not only neo-Romance elements which come from times of his establishment in the year 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the alhambra-style which was added around 1900.
Since the careful modernization 1995 is the palaces' Thermal the favorite bath of the pool expert iris Meder - and that not only, because it comes from the Black Forest initially.
"It is already an achievement to melt so different architectural styles to a so fabulous unit together", says Meder.
Apparently only still near such a palace the dive is minor matter in the thermal pool.
