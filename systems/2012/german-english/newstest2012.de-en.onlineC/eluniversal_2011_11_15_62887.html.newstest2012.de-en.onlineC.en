MSS announces some research protocols for the location of the gene for corpulence
They social security institution of Mexico leads a research project for the location of the gene for corpulence with children and young people that is supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social security institution of Mexico) announced that it conducts a research project for the discovery of the gene for corpulence with children and young people under the title "Genetics of the corpulence in childhood and youth" with which the genetic marker in connection with predominance are supposed to be found.
Miguel Cruz López, conductor of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of medical research, emphasis biochemistry) at the clinic hospital declared to de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, that an interdisciplinary team was built up, existing from doctors, nurses, feeding specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course of studies at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to the participation in the study. Prospective customers can come to the sports grounds of the IMSS in the valley from Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 o'clock tests with children and young people are carried out.
It stressed that the investigation began on the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the Federal state México) and is continued by Nezahualcóyolt since the 8th October on the sports ground (in the east of the Federal state México).
If the objective is reached by 500 to 600 investigation persons, the study is continued on the sports ground by Independencia (in the south of the main municipal district) and finished on that by Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
It declared the becoming acquainted of the factors and the role of the genetics in connection with the development of corpulence and the identification of factors of risk of Mexican children and young people for the prevention of chronic degenerative illnesses is the objective of the study.
On the occasion of the worldwide Tags of the diabetes it declared it is striven for that three thousand children and young people in the age of six to 14 years questionnaires feeding-gotten with the consent and under surveillance their parents should fill.
Also questions are asked to you about their physical activity and their familiar illness case history in order to control factors of risk which diabetes or kidney insufficiency could result in the consequence.
He exported furthermore, that on the mentioned Saturdays the investigation persons measured (Weight, size, waist extent), controlled their blood pressure and determined blood values as the glucose mirror, Triglyceride, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (Attempt of the identification of genes in connection with corpulence in the childhood) would become.
Cruz López stressed, this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of the concern of the health personnel over the alarming gain of young people.
"The health inquiries from the years 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years the part of corpulent boys around 77 percent and that of the girls with corpulence increased around 47 percent. Also the Übergewichtigkeit went up dramatically", stressed the specialist of the IMSS.
It indicated the search for genetic Markern is reasonable because the genetic history of the population of Mexico would be distinguished from that of other nations.
He served, that one (e) Mexican (in) on average too 65 percent more Indian-American, too 30 percent more European and to 5 percent of African origin it is what is reflected in the genes that stand with diabetes and predominance in connection.
Very generally it declared to burn the surplus of the energy taken as me (Calories) the genetics of the corpulence presses itself in the impotence from, so that this is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher declared that would withstand direct benefits for the investigation participants in a comprehensive investigation of the children with whom would be found whether these showed a degree of Übergewichtigkeit or corpulence.
Even the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the nape and at the inside arm (Akanthosis) which refer to the probability of metabolism troubles and diabetes in the Vorstadium would be examined.
All information would be handled confidentially and the parents would be informed of them in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain the parents all results of measurement and suggest changes of the life-style which are adequate for the prevention of illnesses to them.
Cruz López declared there would be three basic factors which are responsible for predominance, corpulence and other chronic illnesses: To transfer movement mangle, that is missing movement in the everyday life, most time of the day before the television set and to use means of transportation, short ways on foot to go starts.
The high calorie photo, that is, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger and so forth) together with a high fat and egg white photo as well as the genetics that is supposed to be analyzed in this research project.
