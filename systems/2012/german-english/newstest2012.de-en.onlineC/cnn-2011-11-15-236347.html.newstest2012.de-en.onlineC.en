How one enttarnt a lie
A look onto the current headlines shows how dubious and widespread delusion and lie are in the daily life.
The premiership candidate of the republicans, Herman Cain, is occupied with that, the accusations of sexual molestation on the part of several women to become gentleman. Both pages are accused mutually of the lie.
The management of Penn State is accused of the Meineids since one supposedly held reports according to which a pensioned American football coach abused boys sexually back.
In the last week, when the French President of the State Nikolas Sarkozy claimed opposite the American president Barack Obama heard about an open microphone, the Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
The New York congress representative and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner turned himself into the fool when he made circulate denials that were refuted very quickly by irrefutable proofs.
The former premiership candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in the campaign financing that stands in connection with the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then nobody who experienced it forgets of course the media circus which president Bill Clinton released when he lay during his second term of office in the oval Office concerning his sexual relationship to Monica Lewinsky.
Histories above Schummeln in the school and with college-examinations are widespread.
There were incidents in the case of which teachers set their students the examination answers so that they themselves stood with their achievement inspections well.
Mentors that should teach the opposite send an information, that lies and Schummeln are okay.
How much delusion do we experience?
As studies prove, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many these lies be valid, however, as white lies.
Another study shows that foreigners lie to themselves mutually three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
One which to learn for every human being is important, and this is to recognize lies and/or "To uncover lying" both from personal as also for professional reasons.
Remote far from a society game as for example charades in which it is the objective, "Have you"! calling is the Enttarnen of a delusion a serious knowledge field that is based on scientific data that were gathered in the course of the last six decades at universities looked at that comprehensive research projects carried out in particular in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A result of the research is that most old myths were enttarnt about the lying.
Lies look to one into the eyes.
You stutter, stammer blush and do not fidget always.
One must not conclude, however, that to uncover these liars heavily and to enttarnen are.
A practiced Lügenenttarner can penetrate for the truth, when it something fine about the structure of the Behauptung,die facial expressions, about question formulation and timing learns.
I spent several years with examining the scientific results of the comprehensive and constantly wachsenden field of the exposure. And it is clear especially that the Enttarnen of a delusion is a modern ability that is to be learned easily and helps us in the Zurechtfinden in our complex world, when the adjustment or the questioning of persons or negotiations or administration for the own professional responsibilities belong.
Good liars are very good in assessing other people whose to wake interest and to master the own emotions. And they sense intuitively how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research we know, that extrovert people more frequent lie as introvert people, that men "orientated" more frequent "self" Serve lies as women whose lies more orientate by others - normally want to protect they in this way the feelings other -, that married people lie to their partners frequently less than single people (but the lies that they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that others feel less guilty to have lain to this person if a person was enttarnt as a malefactor.
How does one recognize whether anyone lies?
When first, when you observe the normal behavior of this person.
One mentions that "Baselining", the starting position.
She sets a reference point for the later evaluating of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of their experimental person.
You should know better when anyone trips usually constantly with the foot so that they do not accuse him incorrectly if he trips during a meeting with the foot.
Then pay attention to accumulations of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Do not consider these accumulations as an evidence of an exposure as alarm bells, the shrill ones.
Maybe people who deceive are petrified if they attempt to remember their history. Maybe show their feet in the direction to Tür or they lean in direction exit, they change their position in significant way or they show a "relaxation after the interview", this deep, easing exhalation and the change in the attitude, if all hard questions are past.
Enquirers signal often by mistake that an interview is by only in order to hold look-out after this relaxation after the interview.
In addition pay attention to the language of your experimental person.
The gaffe of Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his killed wife is still at the live and activated a national search for it.
Remarkable persons can use also one distanzierende language: "I no sexual relationship with this woman had... Miss Lewinsky" or if one repeats a tricky question in the entire one.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if they answer a tricky question: "Now... in order to say the truth to you... confessed to me so far is... according to best knowledge and conscience."
Through that the answer becomes rather taking than objective, through which often the alarm bells shrill.
There is not any charm means for the Enttarnen of lies, but one can learn abilities thanks to which an exposure is possible.
Thanks to these abilities everyone can become more rarely the victim of swindlers, both in the private- as in the professional life.
