Troops rather feel pity as respect
The event was a Wall Street gala dress, the millions of dollar for homeless veterans in New York City collected.
Kid Rock sang a ballad above helplessness, frustration and loss.
Onto a keyword there collected a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marine around it around.
The amount in black dinner jackets got up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the donation action in the spring.
A rank-high military officer on the gala dress, that among other things of the stick leader and former chairpersons', admiral Mike Mullen was observed, the role of the troops saw different.
"You were introduced as orphans", wrote the officer in an E-Mail.
I am sure, the organizers have it in a well-meant way.
I know that.
But it was not a respect, really not. It was pity.
The blatant inconsistent impressions illustrate the hard relationship between the military and the mostly distanzierten, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But the praise has his price, say service members.
The public behaves increasingly as if the people would do her sorrow in uniform.
"We were not by any means victims", said brigade general Sean B. MacFarland, the troops' in Iraq commanded and soon to Afghanistan will go.
"The only way of the support is "however apparent that one is, to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive for military chiefs, that not thankless or want to appear in the quarrel with the public that uses them.
Also they recognized that the rage which beat towards returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam war was by far worse.
As a consequence conversations occur about pity in the Quiet and Private one between war veterans.
After his two sons from fights have returned with the Marine, the Colonel warned retiredly mark of Cancian they before people being able to see their service outside of the military world from two different perspectives.
Some would consider it with a feeling of reverence since they had conquered rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder whether a "furious, violent veteran" hides himself "under the surface", said Cancian who had fought in Iraq and took over a higher state post after his return in Washington.
During his job hunting, so he said, he sensed that some of the Befrager inquired subtly whether it is in the situation to resist to the pressure of a demanding post in Washington now after his return from the fight.
"If you talk about your service, you must hold the negative impressions on the other hand", declared Cancian his sons.
The missing lightness of the military is rooted partially in the missing interest of the Americans at the war.
That services on the battlefield become little experience with the military from a country has and it sees only little benefit in the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan, selected only rarely as praise.
"We than to appreciate a nation more the way it was still completely usual in the Second World War" did not say "military heroism" lieutenant General David Barno retiredly, the US troops' in Afghanistan commanded.
Instead of this the praise of the politicians and the public most mainly focuses on the sorrow of a service member.
Troops find recognition for the number of the attacks that they stood, the number of the friends, who lost it or for the weight of their injuries.
