What does the fraud represent with sick announcements?
According to the family allowances UMP and government tackle the sick announcements now.
Nicolas Sarkozy arrives on Tuesday, the 15th November in Bordeaux, to consult around a family allowance cash and a speech about that - already since 2007 always turning round again - to express topic of the fight from the state against social fraud as well as economical dependence.
In order to accompany this attack that goes out of the aim to subject the economy in a hardness test, on the other hand, however, herald of an axis of the right premiership campaign does not represent less, the majority wants to concentrate on employee suffering-announcements.
At first with budget-economical objective: the government aims for the introduction of a fourth Karenztages for consideration of a sick announcement with employees in the private sector.
On good German means this, that a sick employee without approval of the specific company would lose the wage of four days, thus therefore at least 15% of his monthly income.
A Maβnahme that according to the Tageszeitung"Les" Anger threatens "reverberations" to cause, to insert 280 million euros, however would help.
And that with another Maβnahme of rather symbolic character would go einher: to arrange the civil servants an uncompensated Karenztag in the illness case (up to now there is not any qualifying period for them, in the contrast to the three Karenztagen in the private sector).
Stand meanwhile these questions at what the abuse combined with Arbeitsabsenz is aimed at this time in the discussion, the majority provokes the fraud subject also anew.
"Controls will be considerably more important, and in addition these are to refund if this is demanded" warned Xavier praying-edge on Sunday, the 13th November, before the microphone of the sender RTL.
As also in other cases the effects of this announcement seem a little bit out of proportion with regard to the reality from fraudulent actions in the field of the sick announcements.
This is in fact already since 2002 object of permanent observation as well as political offensives which most frequently bore fruits.
The French are not more frequently sick elsewhere in Europe than persons are.
Let's stay, however, at first with the national digits.
According to the country health insurance CNAM more than 237 million euros of day compensations were paid in the year 2006.
Gemäβ of the economic research and documentation institute of the health service represented the day compensations in the year 2008 with 11.3 billion euros 5% of the health editions.
Under this amount 46% fell concerning concerning motherhood vacation as well as accidents at work and 54% illness vacation, that heiβt 6.2 billion euros.
And accordingly 2.5% of health editions.
In the year 2010 only 14.5 sick person days the French were entitled opposite the 17.8 days in the year 2009 according to a study of the Alma Consulting group on the average.
An average which hushes up certain differences: another, in the year 2007 of Monster.com, web site for career planning, was published, it showed that 75% of the 40th 000 consulted, French employees declared not to have taken any single sick person day.
Another, study this time understood from the health insurance explains that 37% of the sick announcements were in the year 2010 of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and a month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above that.
Compared with their European neighbors the French employees tend therefore not more than elsewhere to disability.
One in the year 2010 of two researchers of the French, state center's for science research (CNRS) led long-term study showed, that between 1994 and 2001 the global Absenzquote (illness- or in another way establishes) oscillated, and indeed in France between 10% and 11% towards 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud with sick announcements sets one disappearing small part with regard to the illicit work dar.
Concerning the fraud only a weak Ausmaβ is reached here.
The Bestärkung of the legislation since in 2002 it brings with themselves that there are systmatische controls with sick announcements that exceed 45 days.
In the year 2008 the CNAM found (public college for Aus- and further education of technicians and engineers) under 1.5 million controls, that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized ones, short-term sick announcements, that heiβt in 37,050 Fällen",ungerechtfertigt or too long" were.
In the systematically controlled sick announcement cases of more than 45 days of duration one counted 11% of an"unangepassten under 1.2 million or unjustified" Fell, the heiβt 132.000.
In total this does therefore 169.000"ungerechtfertigte" Fells onto several millions of employees that asserted a sick announcement.
A digit which represents only a weak Ausmaβ opposite for example that one of the illicit work.
According to the UMP representative Dominique Tian, author of a feature appeared in July with regard to this question, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss of earnings per annum, that is more than the total costs at day compensations, and thus considerably more than those ones defraudation at last-named.
