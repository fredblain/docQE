"Cold and inhuman": Different Behring Breivik appears for the first time in front of a public court
Different Behring Breivik, the man, of the two amok races has stood, at which in this summer in Norway 77 people were killed, described itself in his first appearance in front of a public court in Oslo as a "Widerstands"k√§mpfer.
I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar Norwegens", he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I raise objection against the court since you received your mandate of organizations the hate ideologies support and because the multiculturalism is supported by that."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monolog, there it "Breivik not the possibility wanted to give, to use this hearing as a platform on which it can express his opinions."
For the same reason he refused Breivik who brought along a first of all written speech, the permission to turn to the members of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim in addition ordered that the police Breivik keep for 12 more weeks in investigation custody it four weeks no access to the media has. He said that the authorities will control all visits and the entire correspondence exactly more than eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in the hope to be able to look to Breivik into the eyes, others wanted the confirmation that it stays behind Schloss and bolt.
All participated with the objective, that everything comes to a locking away.
"I thought it seems cold and inhuman", told a survivor of Utoya to the Norwegian sender NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it continues a piece after I saw and heard the suspect."
Breivik bore a dark suit and a blue tie and seemed during the entire hearing quiet and professional. It looked to journalists and survivors into the eyes, than he entered the building and again left.
In spite of Breiviks bizarre tip, he would be a part one larger "Widerstands"bewegung, the judge to the conclusion came, that it is not insane and said that it would not give any proof of that that he had had accomplices.
It likes to please to unite, that the attacks of the 22nd July was apparent the work of a single extremist and not that of a group radicals'.
However that facilitates automatically the grief and the confusion that a whole nation still senses?
"I wanted, it would look like a monster, but he does not do that", the member of a victim said.
"It would be easier for so much if he did it."
