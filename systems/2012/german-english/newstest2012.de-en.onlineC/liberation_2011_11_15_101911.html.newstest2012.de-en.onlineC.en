Europe invented the democracy, now it remains to think over the European democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a sensitive good.
The European continent should be able to remember even that, who had been able to pass the entire 20th century to their invention in the Athens more than two thousand years ago about the tragedies of the First world war, the totalitarianism, the holocaust, Gulag, however, of also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonels in Greece above themselves.
Some had believed presumably, it suffices to exercise the right to vote and indeed in most directly possible way, in order to see the democracy prevailing over their enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon"dem small" that it was a question of a feature of the state of mind.
The general right to vote that represents necessary condition of the democracy is condition not sufficient for that and can become zum"Unterdrückungsinstrument just as well", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot squeezed it out then.
No, democracy requires more by far: a public room, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the powers, a training, clarification, economical and social esprit de corps, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe in which we are is a depression, but she is just as much and most first of all a political and democracy crisis.
The mind change of the Greek Wahr-Falsch-Referendums would have had twice informative character in this respect: once that of the necessity of a forceful return of the politics, on the other hand, however, also that one of the worrying feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be taken as outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight were migrated today and that the republican soldiers, or most of those of them, not aim more into the correct direction.
We do not have to extract anything in order to insist on a success of the internal referendum which was organized in dependence of the necessities and in turned precedence.
A free appearance for the European autocrat or a jump with joined eyes into the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: A groβartige choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, from full right, clarified and constant, a choice and democracy, this time on European level.
There are not any crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - one does not know by the way already anymore where to end the enumeration - since there is only a single crisis, and this rules in Europe.
It is completely Europe, which submits to the dictation of the markets and the rating agencies which suffers from his powerlessness and his solidarity lack.
It is completely Europe, which is humiliated on international level.
One is worried about sovereignty transfers in direction Europe - it is completely in this case Europe, which loses his sovereignty by degrees, and in this way each of the nations attached to him.
The priority consists in that, the nation sovereignty the leadership of the European project back onto the hand give.
Because it was due to the entirety, whether the Europeans reduce the load of their debts, free themselves from the markets and can initiate a future through investments.
Definitely the exit from the crisis has to lead decisions on European level to the condition that can not be felled without total demokratische Rechtmäβigkeit without us into the ruin.
After this proposal of Jacques Delors and the socialists was combated long time over, everyone insists today the European economic leadership on that.
Agreed.
A renewed Torheit and a further dead end would be to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it vorschwebt to the citizens -, however.
We must take a new stage of European construction onto ourselves.
In order to make in France the republic arise, one needed the fact, "create" republicans too.
The revolution of the interests alone could achieve here not suffices.
This instruction keeps on remaining valid.
We must form a Europe on economical level better integrated.
This can only be achieved, when one one seen political more democratic Europe creates, a truly European nation sovereignty.
We need Europeans in order to create Europe.
