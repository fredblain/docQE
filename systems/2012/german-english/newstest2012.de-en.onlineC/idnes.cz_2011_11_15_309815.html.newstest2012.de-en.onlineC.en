Pros claim - a stylist must be also a good psychologist
In the introducing article above how stylists learn I had grumbled a little, that that a little to a lot of material for the beginning was.
There I did in the least not foresee, which still comes.
Lectures of three pros from the branch, the clothing of problematic figures and a class above how that runs "on the place".
It is supposed to come still more badly.
The nearer the examination moves, around so more information and practical tasks stand us before.
But even if the course of everyone on Saturdays and on Sundays occurs, nevertheless it is fully busy.
This time we debated with directress Alena (no only man participates in the course) how one dresses a woman who does not have any figure proportioned ideally.
And those ones are after all most of us.
Ones have a too short neck, the others a too boyish figure without tidy curves and again others are cosy.
It is a thing of the stylist to hide wide shoulders optically, to extend the neck or to conjure the necessary curves.
We got also tips, as one a woman type as Jennifer Lopez - therefore with big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist - pretty and figure-accentuated puts on, without her working far too provocatively.
If for example the difference between waist and hips that the skirt or the trousers does really not like is so great, one should be able to tailor oneself at least a piece nach Maß.
One will surely not regret that, because clothing fitting well is simply exorbitantly expensive.
In such a tailor-made skirt one feels much indeed better, than in one of the pole, that continuously high- and slips, in the waist stands off, and so forth.
Boyish figures can take the liberty in turn to bear clothing with wrinkles, swelling, applications, embroideries or condensing process.
With this amount of information and figure types am I everything to make me gladly that I have a whole week of time go thoroughly through the head.
And in spite of that I am afraid, that it is almost not to be created faced with the homework put on.
Each of the course participants got indeed a Promi assigned, for which they passende Outfits is supposed to think out - day clothing and evening robe.
We are supposed to consider the present appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type at that.
I am supposed "to dress" Miranda Kerr, who you know possibly from the campaign Victoria's Secret.
In the Innern I cheer, because that is much better for me personally than to attract for example Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, which recently presumably increased onto the a hundred kilos (na good, that is a little exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We are supposed to cut the garments out of magazines or search Them in the Internet, print Them and work On them afterwards graphically.
In the "Moodboard" as the whole result is called our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic organization is supposed to be expressed then.
It is very much indeed important to think also about the graphic page of the styling.
The stylist does not dress the models physically indeed only in that, but he designs also the so-called product page into that one journal's (after concrete handicap, for example trend handbags, coats, and so forth).
The stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about that.
But that only on Sunday.
That is, that a stylist must have a good comprehensive survey.
The Saturday lecture filled with information about figure types was seasoned by three visitors equally from the branch:
of the stylist Jan Pokorný, of the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and of the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us, that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able, to use this.
And stylist sent in is able to work with a single clothing piece in very different way.
The charm word is called variability.
So one can carry for example a trench coat as usual above the jeans, therefore how a T-shirt or coat, one can carry it, however, also on the naked body, put on sale shoes for this purpose and carry it as a dress.
It suffices, to roll up the sleeves or the collar and now the whole look looks very differently.
"Plays with that", it stressed.
The most the following council came, however, to me sitedly: "First you must know the rules perfectly."
"Before then you may not hurt it", said Jakub.
At last I realize, why we must drum all these theorems, what one with which can combine and why, also when one in fashion journals frequently very Different see gets.
To completely be silent from fashion shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than finally he photographs.
Therefore one must be prepared for a Fashion Story with ten pages (speak ten Outfits) on stylen at least fifteen.
And also, that the clothing looks sometimes very different on the photo in combination with further Accessoires, than in reality.
With all to the one must reckon therefore during the organization of the Outfits.
That sometimes image and Styl form half of the success, that confirmed us also Jan Pokorný.
There one needs oneself only once Madonna, to look at a not just brilliant singer from whom image and marketing made a world star.
In Czechia one faces the services of a stylist rather reservedly.
Also known personalities hold this frequently for flung money (the main thing is that I bring something as I look in this case is secondary).
And if makes already stylen somebody of us, we are supposed to count then, that it or it forces us with great probability a very different (smaller) size, as it or them in reality needs.
Then one needs afterwards only still too googlen, in order to state with security that the gutter press writes the corresponding Promi decreased again too or, and so forth.
Jan and Mario laid us on Sunday onto the heart, not to believe that a stylist it needs to focus only on the fashion and "to put together" the Outfit then.
During his work it must communicate particularly with the people, which he stylt and he must be a smart psychologist.
Assess people, without toadying and his opinion support.
"If some manageress appoints us in order to screen their wardrobe and in order to complement pretty pieces then we can clear their not the whole cupboard and say - my God, that is really terrible."
"One must find at least a few praiseworthy things to which one recommends which one can carry for this purpose", says Mario.
It showed us also very actually what must contain such a so-called "place bag".
Therefore such a bag that one buttons up at the waist and in which one carries all necessary Proprietäten with himself.
Except for such clear things, as scissors, dispenser to the hair-removing or safety pins contains it also such utensils, as a nylon thread (in this way the stylist helps out from products while photographing, as handbags or hat), specific clips with which the clothing is gathered behind if it is too large (Pins or other clips are forbidden so that the material does not go in a bust way) and of course sewing kit.
So that we, however, do only not have to listen, but can practically try out also something, we learned, as one shoes correctly unterklebt.
Also while photographing in the studio, where the floor is now, one can damage the sole, let alone the outside.
Us o stuck and we stuck...
On the scissors one must not even touch the shoes so that one does not damage it.
Therefore one must really proceed skillfully.
Mario pleased me when he praised my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned skilfulness is just not indeed my strength.
All this was only the fraction of that, what we at to hear at the second weekend continuation course got.
Meanwhile I realized one thing - to dedicate oneself to the styling on professional level, no children's game is.
