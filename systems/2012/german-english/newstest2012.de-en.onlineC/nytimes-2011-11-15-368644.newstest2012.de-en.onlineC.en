Massenschlachtung on a personal level
Einfühlsam and magnanimously Peter Englunds new book begins "Beauty and terror. A History of the First World War, tells in nineteen fates" with a long list about central figures that goes to one to hearts.
Here a tip, as one could proceed: Cut out this page cautiously and turn it into your bookmark.
You will become acquainted with these people in Englunds of novelistic story very well. And these central figures function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in these few moments in which you are lost in the fog of the war and robbed of your illusions to Männer and women as Englunds.
A Swedish historian and journalist is Peter Englund.
He is furthermore the new constant secretary of the Swedish academy which determines the Nobel prize for literature.
He wrote an unusual book which he does not describe incorrectly as "a work of the anti-history".
It contains only few great names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and outfit.
It is little a book about that something passed, he declares, but rather a book above how it was. It deals with "Feelings, impressions, experiences and atmospheres".
"Beauty and frights" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both pages of the war together, of school girls and botanists up to mountain climbers, doctors, ambulance driver and office workers.
Some of these people become hero.
Some become prisoner of war, lose limbs, become mad or die.
Each of these lives flares up as the Votivkerzen in a church, some join while others would be ceasing.
Englunds book deviates from the usual history books.
It in addition corrects the idea the First World War was only the disastrous war of position at the west front.
"Beauty and startling" roam with expert look over other theaters of war: the alps, the Balkans, the east front, Mesopotamia, east Africa.
Hives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas among the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is almost from the beginning a traveling book.
The war floods the life of these people as a natural catastrophe, as a hurricane Katrina which smells of Kordit.
You introduce yourself, you are a woman that is at home with their children, and hears cannon fires in the distance. Stay or do you take the flight?
Who comes actually?
Hardly somebody understands what happens or why actually this war is led.
"Missing facts", so Englund finds, "were revamped with suppositions, assumptions, hopes, fears, ideas fix, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and startling" follow single persons as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse, in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Your histories were already mainly taken memories to letters from published material and other.
Your life reports can frightening or be overcoming, nevertheless they are extremely alive in Englunds of the crowd of small moments losing in details.
Many of them deal with lack and Itself make-shift arrangements.
In the history of a German school girl it tells: "Substitute, everywhere substitute."
"Replacement coffee, wrong aluminum, wrong eraser, paper associations, wood buttons."
He tells more of the replacement chimneys in Germany.
He describes "Meat, that was done from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and at last with a wrong bone of wood was served), tobacco that was made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were soled with wood."
There were "837 registered food substitutes which were allowed in the production from sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes as he notes down.
Some histories deal with honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for the wildness and says about the war: "One feels that that is for all that what was rather planned for men than to be in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the best seller and a cigarette and a whiskey in the hand and to do as if such a facade means civilization and as if there were not any barbarism behind the own starched and shod shirtfront."
In reverse a British soldier recognizes that he will presumably die and not take memo from anybody from that or see to that.
"If one refrains from the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that this happens before a public", he writes.
Instead of this it is as terrible as "a condemned man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations act of the old Europe which falls from each other, and about new kinds of the terror.
"The conflict became an economical contest increasingly", writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He catches the arrival of that, what it calls "a new species in the Bestiarium of the still young century's": "the word turned and ideologically convinced mass murderers in the tailor-made suit that slaughters while he is being behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers that attempted actively to infect oneself with a venereal disease with a prostitute in order to escape the front service.
"The grotesque expression of that can be discovered on the market with gonococcus pus, because soldiers bought and smeared onto their genitals, in the hope to come so into the hospital", he writes.
"Those that had really despaired abraded it into the eyes, which led to that, that they were the rest of their life blind."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves poetry becomes supple to Englunds and nevertheless unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he catches the kind and way in which the war "in unique way provoked uncontrollable strengths: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
The people begin themselves to ask why their leaders bring it to the fighting.
The best books about the First World War were mostly rather falsified as Paul Fussells "Great War and Rot Memory" or novels as Erich Maria Remarques "In the west nothing new" as extensive history books.
Englunds band joins an unconventional fame hall.
His book has the most disastrous end from which I ever read in a thing book.
I do not give it anymore.
However it is, as he would have weggeschnappt us this page with the central figures with his book before the nose and lit it with a match.
