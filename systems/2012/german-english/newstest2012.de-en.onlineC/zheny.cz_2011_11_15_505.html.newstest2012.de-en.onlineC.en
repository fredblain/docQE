The worst feminine bad habits: How does it stand with you?
If one asks the men to name some typical feminine bad habits, they joggle some without exception promptly then from the sleeve.
Loves women, you recognize themselves in the following lines, in which we make a few bad habits pass revue again, that make to the men the blood in the veins boil?
Purchase addiction
Does their husband reproach them to be purchase-addicted?
Must you buy at least a quarrel for yourself weekly?
Go shopping gladly and may it be also identical a little more in the case of actions?
Then it is presumably really a question in your case of a weakness.
Some women are at least conscious of that to themselves and attempt to hold their purchase pleasure to some extent under control.
But hand onto the heart, which woman already tolerates it, to hang about in search of an outerwear fitting well only so through a dress business and not to try oneself out now all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if the shopping is a hobby for most women, for the men it is often the pure hell.
Nevertheless they consider how they already often said to their husband once - stay you once more gladly outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I am not too fat"?
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - I am supposed to start jogging or doing gymnastics"?
"You like me anyway"?
That occurs to them in an anyhow best known way?
Yes?
Then belong presumably also to the women who are regular proprietarily from how they look.
That is for a long time not that you are supposed to make go, however, many men react to that allergically if their wife complains about their appearance constantly.
The stronger sex agrees agreed - with increasing frequency of the complaints the women are increasingly more incompatible.
Order and cleanness at first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Windows clean, boarding and dust wipe, scrub the tub - and this at least twice weekdays.
Do you swear at their partner because he stamps again once onto the clean tiles, you the children chide, with dirty shoes because the just scrubbed wash basin is already again dirty and because the glass door has at the living room cupboard already again fingerprints, where nevertheless the polishing does so much effort?
You should suffer from this kind "of Devianz", then you should know, that one must not exaggerate anything and that order and not suit cleanness in the family life at first place.
Finally this immoderate purity fad can damage also the mutual relationships and particularly the rest in the family.
Burins
"Dirty gym trousers come into the clothes-basket."
"You really want to put on the old socks tomorrow once again"?
"One does simply not fling a wet towel onto the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you must not be surprised, that that exasperates him.
Clearly that is not badly meant, nevertheless they only want, which has everything his order.
If the men knew this, the women did not need to grumble possibly so much then.
Gossip and gossip
Some women clap and gossip gladly, there whispers behind the back or even slanders or one forges alliances.
Women are now focalized on relationships, therefore they gossip gladly about such topics, as for example - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Presumably everyone of us women is ready with a little harmless gossip and gossip.
Hand onto the heart - that is particular to presumably all women.
That is not to be mixed up, however, with gossips of coarsest caliber, that nothing and nobody is holy, that despise presumably everyone in their surroundings and that represent a considerable danger especially for woman collectives.
