Of Christian Teevs
Does the Deutsche Bank give up their business with Agrarrohstoffen?
According to MIRROR-ONLINE-information Josef Ackermann charged a team to examine the consequences of the speculation for the paupers of the world.
In January the company group leader wants to draw consequences then.
Hamburg -
For the federal citizens the thing is clear: 84 percent of the Germans do not think according to a study acceptable that banks speculate in Agrar raw materials as wheat or corn.
Two thirds of the interviewees even demand that the Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it intensifies the problems of the poorest of the world.
That is the result of a Forsa-inquiry on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report, that Foodwatch in the middle of October presented.
In that the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets push up the prices at the global raw material stock exchanges - and bear the banks therefore a complicity at the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of the Verbrauchersch√ºtzer turns actually against German-bank-leader Josef Ackermann even if big banks act as Goldman Sachs or similar to Morgan Stanley.
Initial were commemorated raw material bets for that to protect traders against price fluctuations.
However in the meantime most experts are agreed that the long spinners were uncoupled from offer and demand - and at the expense of the Poorest Profits do.
Differently than the US competitors husbandman reacted to the criticism: He promised, to check the reproaches and said, "to risk the good call of the Deutsche Bank", no business is it "evaluate.
According to information of MIRROR ONLINE an International Team checks currently the reproaches from the Foodwatch-report.
Until end of the year the examination is supposed to be finished, then the results are presented to the executive board of the Deutsche Bank - along with recommendation, as that is supposed to be dealt with.
At the end of January the top of the bank wants to inform then which consequences it draws.
At the end a reduction of the raw material business could stand, or even the complete turning away.
Husbandman tinkers with his image
Foodwatch-leader Thilo Bode welcomed the information, at the same time his criticism strengthened, however, at the finance branch: "The betting on increasing prices of food shows especially drastically how banks damage the common weal today inconsiderately."
Husbandman stands as an uppermost bank lobbyist now especially in the duty.
"The Deutsche Bank must delete all installations with which money is used for bets onto food prices" from their port folio, said Bode.
"Regardless, whether it goes Mr husbandman around people suffering from hunger or around the call of the Deutsche Bank."
The insight of husbandman comes at first sight surprisingly, clear is, however, that the company group leader would like to give few months in front of his departure from the office a perfect picture.
On Monday the Deutsche Bank announced that the executive board leader will not change differently than plannedly into the supervisory board.
With a turning away of the controversial Agrar-speculation it could improve his image.
And around possible losses he hardly needs to cut himself - in this way finally his successor would have to do.
Every Second would give up raw material installations
Foodwatch makes an effort for holding the pressure on the manager highly.
Up to now already more than 30,000 internet users participated in the campaign of the organization.
On Tuesday Bode published the inquiry, for which the institute Forsa at the 7th has questioned and 8th November 1001 people.
Just hold eleven percent once it accordingly for legitimate, that the Deutsche Bank offers installations with which prices are bet on for food.
Many bank customers would draw also personal consequences if they find out that their bank participates in such businesses: Every Second would give up according to the inquiry all installations with which money flows into the raw material speculation.
43 percent would warn to acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent indicated to think about that to cancel their account and to change to another institute.
