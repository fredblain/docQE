The in Austria at the power contained government the groβen social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition has decided on Tuesday," to record budget rule" into the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and to avoid also to a possible degradation on the part of rating agencies in the top bank credit of Austria (AAA) "eine"Goldene.
It the social-democratic chancellor Werner Faymann that had announced this decision of the exit of the Council of Ministers was highly personal therefore by far although the public Austrian state fault is at 74.6% about the criterion of 60% set through the Meuse funnel contract, however clear below the fault level of the countries as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"The solvency of Austria had not sunk from AAA all at once on AA+, we would have to pay every year three billion euros so in addition to interests", argued Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellors and Christian-democratic Auβenminister.
Austria allows also a demand of the Brussels summit conference of the member states of the euro zone of the 26th October: The state and government leaders would have demanded then the photo of the reduction of public deficits to end of the year 2012 as well as a return in the public account balance into the constitution or through decree of an equivalent law.
The Maβnahme caught by the Austrian government to that resembles dem"deutschen model since Germany had been the first European country" that" had incorporated "a solche"Regel" into the constitution.
Up to the year 2017 the structural budget deficit should sink every year around 0.75% of the gross domestic product (BIP), from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the Federal state should not cross the 0,35%-Grenze of the BIP, wohingegen the regional states in the same way as the municipalities should show harmonious budgets.
It is an objective to eradicate the budget debts in the horizon of 2020/21 under the 60%-Kriteriums set through the Meuse funnel agreement.
