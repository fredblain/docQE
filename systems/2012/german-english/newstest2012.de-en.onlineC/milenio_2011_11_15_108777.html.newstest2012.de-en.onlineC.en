To count out the possibility separately the ballot papers in Michoacán is taken into consideration
According to the information of PREP the difference between the first and the second place during the choice of the governor is just 27 percent at which 879 voices were not counted out by in total 6074 yet.
The possibility of the single counting of the ballot papers is this year at the choices a reality in Michoacán, because according to the data distributed by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP) the difference between the first and second place at the governor choices is just 27 percent at which 879 voices were not counted out by in total 6074 yet.
In this sense the president of the Consejo reminded general del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, of the choice place having just adopted a row of regulations for the harmonization of the local rules with the reforms of the Federal states in choice matters once on the last 9th one November.
It is reminded of that that yet his law had not adapted either his political constitution or his choice law to Michoacán about the choice justice onto the reforms adopted by the congress so that these had not come into force with this choice round. The governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the state indicator within the periods of time planned for that with the argument, still to have objections to that.
On 9th November the Uppermost court of justice of Mexico (SCJN) decided on constitution complaint submitted over that one by the local legislative and the voice of the state representative for the constitution reforms judged as "invalid and illegal" too since this does not have the right about that "decide or on the other hand to insert a veto".
María de los Ángeles Llanderal declared with an interview about the possibility of the single counting of the voices that thanks to the assumption of the guidelines through the Consejo general del IEM the possibility that the local choice authority can count out the ballot papers in part or completely would exist now.
So can under the following conditions the The results will make in voices contained to a or several choice parcels in part counted out in the protocols not ueberein; there are not the protocols about the voice counting and calculation file-moderately or it is not in the possession of the chairperson of the choice committee or there are obvious errors or alterations in the protocols.
In addition the total counting of the completely filled voter registration cards can occur, when there is a difference between the supposed winner and the one that stands on the second place, the same or smaller than a percent is, an explicit request is presupposed at the beginning of the meeting of the parties-and/or. Coalition chairpersons before, that is the second of the mentioned candidates.
The scrutiny can occur also in their entirety if on completion of the tidy calculation it is stated that the difference is identical or smaller between the supposed winner and the candidate on the second place than a percent presupposed there is an explicit request of a representative of the party that candidate Zweiter became. In this case the choice parcels would be excluded that a partial counting was exposed to.
It is Erwähnenswert that the choices are in Morelia in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference is just 0.16 percent between the first and the second place although the voices were not counted out by 129 of in total 923 choice protocols yet.
