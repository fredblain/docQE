Development of the travel prices since 1989
To 1989 there were in the former ČSSR only five granted state travel agencies: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies sold then only journeys into the socialist East-bloc countries particularly, into the west might then only Chosen.
And so Czech tourists traveled onto the Baltic Sea (into the German Democratic republic - the GDR), into the Soviet Union (Sochi on the peninsula of Crimea at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania onto the Black Sea and to Hungary onto the Balaton.
A bright exception was the period of 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel also to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia broke a prowestern course and therefore the journeys were restricted to Yugoslavia strongly.
A great paradox of those socialist times was it, that it was allowed not even citizens of the East bloc (therefore also the Czechoslovac), to travel within the framework of the socialist countries freely.
If a citizen of the ČSSR to poles or really wanted to travel for example individually to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter to that then, otherwise Individualreisen were not possible.
Already then the travel agencies offered also journeys into the west, then one had to accept, however, gigantic snakes or stay also at the sleeping bag the night before the travel agency, and/or have at least "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Also so the thing had long yet not worked.
The so-called currency promise - the condition for a departure into the west - was given to only "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not indeed a freely exchangeable currency, without currency promise it would have been therefore impossible to get the necessary finance means (western currency) for a journey into the west.
The from far away meisten Czechs did not transfer their vacation at home, any miracle, that the Czechs bought themselves innumerable weekend houses and Datschen - a habit that lasts until today.
A travel revolution of the Czechs followed the samtenen revolution of 1989 onto the foot.
During to 1989 a vacation in the GDR or in Bulgaria the measure of all things were, the Czechs transferred in the last year 4.5 million of their foreign vacations into countries of the whole world.
A tremendous paradox that one is not more conscious today at all is the fact, that one into the currently most popular vacation country of the Czechs - Croatia until in 1989 at all could not travel because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Resemble from the beginning of the nineties of the last century the currency duty into the adjacent west-European countries was canceled, which caused a tremendous wave of short visits particularly to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovacs could simply not get long time of their journeys into the west enough, everyone wanted to have been at least a few days there.
So the Czech holiday-makers slept in the case of journeys to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had then already the money for an accommodation in the hotel or in a retirement.
A typical feature at trips abroad of Czechs was then a trunk vollgepackter with canned food, beer and continuous sausage and so forth.
A further important milestone was the introduction freely that one exchangeable Czech's crown - after decades our tourists could buy the western currency freely at last.
Our life level and through that also the average salaries went up, which einmündete in 1997 into a further important moment.
Thanks to the increased demands for journeys the travel agencies began after 1997 to prepare journeys through charter flights through which the air trips verbilligten thanks to the possibility to negotiate quantity discounts in comparison with the past incredibly regularly.
The Czechs, except for the USA, already currency-free payments with all sophisticated countries of the world, had end of the nineties which made the travel even simpler.
It resulted in the year 2000 in a further interesting moment in the history of the "mail-samtenen" traveling than thanks to the high demand the first direct charter flight into an exotic country was dispatched - to Thailand.
Since then annually direct charter-airplanes with Czech passengers fly into far remote sunny countries; this year one flies directly from Czechia to twelve exotic Destinationen.
Onto the 100 Tsd. Czechs travel annually to exotic countries!
A further significant moment in the epoch which characterized our "postrevolutionary" development came in the year 2008.
On 17th November 2008 the visa duty for Czech tourists through which our country joined definitively under the sophisticated countries of the world picked up the USA.
In the year 2008 the Czechs spent in their history for the first time more than half of their vacation abroad (50.3%) and for the first time it gave for a single vacation stay including the costs at the vacation place of more than 15 Tsd. CZK per person from.
