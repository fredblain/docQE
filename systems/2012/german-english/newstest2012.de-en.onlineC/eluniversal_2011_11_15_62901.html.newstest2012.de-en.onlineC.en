Asphalt of the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the department of chemistry at the Mexican university UNAM develops with polymers modified asphalts in order to make the mixture more resistant opposite climatic conditions and temperature variations
Attention was paid to the signs that take the pavement as a basis, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (City field of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the department for chemistry (FQ) at the university UNAM, warning and assured of, that when the placing and the maintenance of the asphalt coating would happen appropriated, the number of the potholes considerable reduced or even complete are avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from technical view" that it held on the occasion of the International year for the chemistry he announced that the lab for which it is responsible with polymers develops modified asphalts around one the asphalt similar mixture make, that, however, a greater mechanical resistance both at high as also with low temperatures shows.
Herrera Nájera meant, that this kind of modified asphalts in areas with extremely hot climate should be used, as for example in some cities in the north of the country, in order to correct the behavior of the pavement and to avoid the appearance of potholes in this way.
It declared that the asphalt - the most difficult part of the oil - is a hydrocarbon connection from which a part has a high molecular weight - the so genannten Asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called Malthene. Together they lend the pavement his characteristic tough-elastic behavior.
Tough-Elastic behavior of the Asphalts means, that this with high temperatures of almost 180°C as a liquid retains, at 120°C it is very viscous and at 50°C almost firm, while he is becoming fragile with very low temperatures.
"That is, that the resistance of the Asphalts is not uniform on the streets, but" is "changed" at a day depending on the climatic conditions and temperature variations, the chemistry engineer exported.
The researcher of the FQ noticed the streets of Mexico City would have mainly a flexible pavement which consists of six material shifts from which the last three contained asphalt.
Between the uppermost shifts a sealing coat of asphalt lies that consists of stones small, bathed in asphalt and then hardened.
Every single Steinchen of this sealing coat, was swum in asphalt.
If the vehicles are moved on that and strengths are produced, this shift facilitates a good strength distribution in the pavement.
"If it was modified asphalt, would distribute the strengths still better", thought the chemistry engineer.
"About the sealing coat", he exported, "a last shift is laid out, the so-called base that consists of tiny stones that is of sand that was swum also in asphalt.
Since is this shift in the contact with the vehicle tires, they need a greater mechanical strength than the sealing coat and it must make friction.
The this pavement most strengths receives and distributed, the base in addition needs an adequate fat person and the material of which she exists must be maintained.
The climatic conditions, in particular moisture and temperature variations, are wider, important factors to be considered, before all things the water", he said, " because it influences the behavior of the sealing coat considerably.
If the ground becomes moist, water penetrates the shift and escapes in an only difficult way again. That causes a softening of all shifts of the pavement and due to that the appearance of potholes.
If a pothole arises", he said, "the sealing coat is cleared away first of all while the sealing coat is being influenced only after that. But the damage does not arise immediately, but it is a question of a process which would have to be maintained with the first signs through adequate maintenance programs."
The member in the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National research system of Mexico) declared that the vehicle load is a further important cause for the appearance of potholes. Therefore the fat person of every shift of the pavement must always stand in relation to the vehicle load and it must be guaranteed that to avoid frequent potholes this regulation is kept to.
Rafael Herrera referred, that still many studies on themselves could wait, for example above asphalt emulsions that are in other countries even already on the market, and with those ones the potholes simple and repair without application of high temperatures made.
