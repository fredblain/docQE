Sister of the Mexican president loses apparent choice in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims, who drug traders supported opponents to Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race around the governor post.
Apparently the sister of president Felipe Calderon lost their application for the office of the governor from Muchoacan during the violent state choices. She said on Monday drug traders would have influenced the race for the benefit of one of their opponents.
According to the provisional results Fausto Vallejo won the race from the Institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, around the governor post in the western state.
"The intervention of the organized crime during the entire choice processes and is especially on the day of yesterday alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country", Luisa Maria Calderon said a day in a radio interview after the choice on Sunday.
"You threatened our candidates, our employees' in the inquiries... you filled voting booths, built up street blockades... and people charges to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI controlled seven decades in Mexico until they lost the premiership in the year 2000.
But they strive for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the premiership choice in July.
Vallejo seems to only just have beaten Claderon that had led in the inquiries before the choice day still.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN of their brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as winners.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left Democratic revolution party PRD, the currently still current governor, came to place Three, a difficult defeat, for the fissured and luckless left leadership for the premiership choice 2012.
Also Aureoles refused to acknowledge the provisional results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies connections to drug traders and pushes the other candidates, to accept the results.
Michoacan was mastered long time by drug cartels that specialized on marihuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the native country of president Calderon and it chose Michoacan, to start a militarily led offensive in December 2006 against drug traders.
The power still lasts.
A PAN-mayor was killed a week in front of the choice during a choice event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates got out of fear from the local choices.
For the PRI a victory strengthens the party, regardless, as disgustingly the choices also appear in Michoacan.
The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the running around the presidency is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory makes us look in the next year courageously."
