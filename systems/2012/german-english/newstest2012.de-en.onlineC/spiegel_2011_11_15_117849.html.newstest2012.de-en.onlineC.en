21st house in Vienna
The pavilion gotten changed
Of Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architecture history with heights, depths and happy ending: The Austrian international exhibition pavilion of Brussels 1958 achieved prices, became the museum in Vienna, stand leer and degenerated.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
If by modern Nachkriegsarchitektur is enthused, of clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new materials that are typical for the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer is for the Brüssler international exhibition 1958 an apt and famous example.
Schwanzers pavilion got then the gravel Prix d'Architecture light for his and floating working steel glass construction.
The construction is regarded until today as a milestone of contemporary architecture.
It made the architect so known that that one built Pavillon also during the next international exhibition of Austria.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like secondary construction in Munich it became 1973 finally internationally famous.
His as a temporary exhibition construction one had set up planned pavilion to the international exhibition in the Swiss garden near the Viennese south railway station, rebuilt and opened up in 1962 in that a museum of the 20th century - it was mentioned the "20th house".
Neither the building was not suitable, however, spatial and technical as a museum - no walls for the hanging of the art, no good climate.
In spite of that it was used for so long until the contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building stand leer and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz rebuilt the pavilion, he calls now "21st house" and is useful in future as a museum of contemporary art.
Tuesday evening opens the museum there to Belvedere, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became new directress of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, put through the new start.
Husslein-Arco, promovierte art historian with considerable career and other in the youth as Eiskunstläufererin, later with Sotheby's, that Guggenheim Museum and as a foundation directress of the museum the modern one Salzburg, put through the reconstruction emphatically with politicians and monument conservationists, she got public means and private sponsor money and defined the use.
Except for present art the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there should be a café and a book store, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Severe supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was then the ideal occupation.
Not only, because it Joseph Olbrichs Secession alters into Vienna sensitively and enlarges and had won the competition, but because he studied near swan cerium at the Technical Vienna University and the pavilion was an "enormously important place" at which he had had a look at the exhibitions "almost every weekend" for it.
He knew the aurochs-draft, and he knew the problems of the building which lost generosity and lightness already during his moving to Vienna and his Umnutzung.
During the present reconstruction there were far greater problems: The building was "an energy centrifuging", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were exchanged, used glass-fabric supported insulation glass and replaced the glass roof through special triplex.
Cold bridge steel bases were supported or replaced, and asbestos-filled covers were renovated.
Two basements brought place for the new use, a sunk light ditch between house and street guarantees for the illumination, a bridge leads to the entry - almost a new building, however still the easy tail pavilion.
The original external doors stayed, the house is deleted in the old reddish brown rust protection tint.
And the cinema hall is even still very just the same how it was formerly.
And that all under severe supervision of the monument authority and with small budget.
"Often a material which is good and which is cheap and also the monument protection office liked" had to be found", Krischanitz says and refers to a ruppigen ground in the basement.
In spite of all compulsions, problems and reconstructions the building stayed flexibly and slightly.
It was difficult with the pavilion "that came along from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-Geschichte".
Such architecture "always stands "at the wrong place" and wants to raise a correct consciousness in spite of that.
In this case the 21st house is, however, not at the wrong place, because a city-structural stroke of luck kicked in: Around the Swiss garden around just the completely again planned "central station accommodation", with office and living houses, arises.
And maybe still another stroke of luck will set in: The 21st house could get strengthening of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca of Habsburg bought the Berliners Temporary Arts Center, and as one hears, she negotiates already with the city around a nachbarschaftlichen location in the Swiss garden.
