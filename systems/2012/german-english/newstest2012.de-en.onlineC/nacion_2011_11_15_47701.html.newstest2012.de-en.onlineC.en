"In Costa Rica a dream which is fulfilled is to be played"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva the bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared on giving Sunday nearest in the national stadium of one of their best concerts.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band assures that for them a dream is fulfilled if they play in Costa Rica.
The bass player and Mitgründer of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil an excluding-interview, assured of that.
The band is in the South American part of their tour for the celebration of their twenty year existing and on Sunday, the 20th, they do their only stop in Central America.
On this day they occur from 19.30 o'clock in the national stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read a departure from the conversation whose complete duplicate is to be found by La Nación in the online-edition.
For your Costa Rican fans a dream is fulfilled if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you conscious to yourselves, which means that for your fans?
In Costa Rica a dream is to be played which is fulfilled also for us.
That is just the second time once, that we in South- and play Central America, and until now it was splendid.
I was only once in Costa Rica to the vacation. It is a so wonderful country that we will remain still a few days there designated.
For us it is exciting to bring our music there there.
I ask that to you because the fans are the band completely turned out. You experience the days most intensely before the concert.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank to stand all these years at our page.
We needed almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thanks, to have waited for so long and we are sorry about having needed for so long until we came here.
Some people even think that your concert will become the greatest show of the year.
A little pressure does not carry that out your visit from?
Some of the most splendid shows which we put down in the last 21 years occurred in the last two weeks.
We played on a few giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope for those ones doing us fitly for this concert in Costa Rica.
Real, we fancy playing there.
We love this country, we surf gladly and we are enthusiastic from the jungle. For that Costa Rica belongs to the best countries of the world.
How did you become acquainted with Costa Rica and his waves for the surf?
Many of ours friend are surfer and I have a splendid friend that lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply inconceivable.
My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for the surf. Together with Mexico are the excellent areas for the surf. In this way, about people, that the surf love, we heard about that.
With a look onto the tour you offered giant shows with many songs.
Which plans do you have for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there yet, we do not set ourselves also any borders.
We will attempt to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I believe, that is partially like this because we can have nine plates and play them about 120 songs. Everyone likes another song so that the decision which we will play in each case is not easy.
If we incorporate two or three songs that we did not play more already longer into the repertoire, we can receive our concentration better uprightly and they surprise us because the reasons call it to us into the memory why these songs fell to us. Otherwise they could fall into oblivion.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I believe, therefore also for the public.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty year long history.
If you look back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success?
Yes, total.
At first once I believe that nobody of us imagined to play once in a splendid skirt band and that also still more than 20 years long. That works as a dream.
We put also further on this blessing and think it fabulous to be able to do music still together also now.
We like ourselves and are enthusiastic of producing music.
We are able to have gone luck onto the places of the world to which we wanted to go always once.
The things could not stand better.
What meant for you to have participated in the birth of the Grunge actively?
It was always an honor to belong to this group of large bands.
We are gotten used well with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and plenty unusual if a movement follows from a group of friends.
Occasionally a band follows from a city, but it is already unusual if five or ten groups come simultaneously from the same city.
We are proud of that and feel honored, to be part the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play still together.
In the last year we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are pleased, to be gotten used still with them all and it honors us to be part of this arisen Seattle-Sounds.
It is also very much unusual, that a band as yours with the same musicians has stayed together for so long time.
Yes, four of us are playing already for 21 years together and check mate (Cameron) bumped 13 years ago to us. That alone already much more time is than many bands überdauern.
At first once I still believe that we consider ourselves all happy at the life his and in addition we take care of each other.
We all are narrow friend, for which musical ways opened up that give every individual the freedom for the experimentation.
Familiar to one the other one and his music. We could not feel better.
Your relationship to the fame was not always simple. On the other hand you could always do thanks to your success what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The kind as we grew it made simpler to us to find a balance.
We guarantee, not too often to be on tour, because it is too easy to succumb to this game with gigantic crowds that love your music.
As long as one thinks of the people coming because of the music, that reminds you of your having to respect the music and what she started up without being crazy on that a famous skirt star be. That anyhow never interested us.
Which memories do you have onto your other project Mother Love Bone?
I believe, we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was splendid.
We were for three years a band which had never handed over a plate up to the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed over having needed for so long. We are gotten used still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) that built up the band with us. If I hear a song or see photos, I think of which incredible human being Andy was and how it made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to the work, to laugh together and to talk about music and soccer and many other topics.
He was an exceptional person and we miss it.
Is the domestic band Las Robertas for the opening of the show in Costa Rica responsible.
It makes select in particular Eddie Vedder, and the band therefore for the opening that you know their works have?
Yes, the production sent us to videos from several groups and we liked this band best. Because of that seeing what can offer Las Robertas live curious we are. That is determined tightening.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter if you play live?
That is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder) I do not have any presentiment.
He sings it, and I believe, he sings the First that he remembers.
By whom were you influenced as a bass player?
Of so vielen+
To the First ones to be remembered by me Geezer butlers, John Entwistle, belong to C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bass players who I like the whole afternoon.
How did it create Pearl Jam to keep the Grunge to the life although it is not a question of a fashion appearance more?
I believe, we all do not feel very united with the word Grunge.
If I think about that, I remember the bands that I mentioned before for example Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all others that arose at the same time. If they are important also today still, I find that splendid, because this music rewards for it hear and bands as Mudhoney do now better music before than ever.
At the beginning their music was darker, now it is more positive.
Why?
That is interesting, because I believe, there are a few songs on the new album that could weave something carelessly. But there are also other songs as The End or Just Breathe who are classified as very dark songs who being had also something positive at themselves.
To both of them the tears came to me when I heard how Ed played it. There are very dark songs.
I believe, when you get older and a little traumatic in your life has passed influenced - e.g. when one loses a dependant or a friend - that your artistic work and your music and these two songs embody that unequivocally for me.
I also think, however, that one can be a happy human being and do dark music in spite of that.
