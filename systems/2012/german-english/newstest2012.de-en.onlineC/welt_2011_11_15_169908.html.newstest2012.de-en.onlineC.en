Warren Buffett gets in with 10 billion near IBM
Finance guru Buffett invests strongly IBM in the IT enterprise.
Since March he has bought up stocks to the value of more than ten billion dollars.
Up to now the tall American investor Warren Buffett had always declared, not in IT- and to invest computer enterprises since the long-term development of the companies can be predicted only badly.
Now he read, however, the annual reports from IBM and changed his opinion about investments in the branch.
He had had to understand already much formerly that IBM offers particularly services and gets computer systems for the IT departments of other enterprises.
An investment of Warren Buffett is regarded as an accolade in the financial world.
Accordingly the IBM IT-Urgestein may mention himself "Sir IBM" now.
Because Buffett revealed now in the US economic sender CNBC that he has bought IBM-stocks since March to the value of 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway climbed up in this way from 5.5 percent to one of the tallest stockholders of IBM with a part.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew about the engagement up to now a little.
He praised the management which had still guaranteed for tidy profits even in the depression.
"You did a fabulous job", said Buffett with regard to the strategy.
IBM comes down since geraumer time the lucrative IT service's as the company of computer centers.
The more than 100 years old computer engineer offers also software and consultation as well as efficient company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until dato rather.
He says he invests only in enterprises whose business he also understands.
Instead of this Buffett grasped for instance at a freight railroad, with a lubricant-manufacturer or machine builder.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway has also parts of a whole series of big concerns as Coca-Colas or the Munich Re next to about 80 own subsidiary companies, the former inhabitants' of Munich Rueck.
The 81-year long one had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway into the 1960er-Jahren and built it up with clever investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world.
Nevertheless his life-style is modest.
He is therefore for innumerable investors in all world a cult figure.
His almost untrüglicher sense for the money-earning was the nickname "Oracle" to him worth "from Omaha".
After Bekannt are climbed the Buffett investment's the IBM stock vorbörslich about a percent.
"Big Blue", as IBM also is named, is at the stock exchange more than in total 220 billion dollars worth and numbers in this way together with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology enterprises of the world.
Near Microsoft, so Buffett said, he does not want to get in, however.
Founder Bill Gates is a narrow friend.
