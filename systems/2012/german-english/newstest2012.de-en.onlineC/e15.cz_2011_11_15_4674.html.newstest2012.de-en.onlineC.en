Fire story:
The Innovator IBM comes into the second century of his existence
One wanted to search for a suitable word, that the strategy of IBM in a most exact way characterizes, then would be this presumably the word "longevity".
For the wide public IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, one knows it as modern enterprise although since his foundation already a century has passed by.
Already their first head put the basis for this longevity - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already it represented the slogan, countless worldwide problems could be solved easily for itself if the people were ready to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" became like this to the trademark, around which the life of the future giant should happen (and simultaneously for the title of the internal magazine which one began near IBM already in the year 1935 to hand over).
This was also the basis of the enterprise culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"Meant for us from IBM this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement in the direction of future.
IBM survived and was successful also therefore a whole century because it remained loyal to his principles and shied away not from changing everything else everywhere.
That allowed to transform us, in the course of our first century, the technologies, the business and also the society.
We hope, which we create still more in the next a hundred years", Samuel J. Palmisano, the present director of the enterprise, said on the occasion of the anniversary.
System thought over
Watson practiced already in the thirties social care of his employees - in similar way, as the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM-people had paid vacation, an insurance, as one of the first American employees through the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothing and a compensation system thought over for best innovator and Händler.
Also the long-term relationships of IBM with their customers are just as worked out.
The enterprise was from the beginning brilliant in the talent promotion - as one of the first companies worldwide IBM disconnected any Diskrimination - and could select itself correspondingly.
In accordance with this antidiscrimination strategy also the present plan is, that Palmisan at the top of IBM in the next year of a woman is taken turns - of Virginia Rometty.
That one is there already thirty years near IBM, up to now it took the position of the Vetriebs-, marketing and strategy leader one.
IBM does in the last years so-called online-brainstormings which many future strategies and innovations arise from.
No miracle - there are ideas enough, in the enterprise really almost half a million of people is busy.
An institution with good call
Your unshakeable position in the business guarantees a strong image and this to inside and according to Außen to the enterprise.
"From the beginning IBM rather had the draft of an institution, as a bare technology enterprise", Economist told that one the professor about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School and the authoress of a book.
"IBM is no technology-enterprise, but a company that helps to solve business problems with the aid of technologies" added George Colony of consulting-company Forrester Research.
As the enterprise itself stresses, it is a difference to be only present on the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - mentioned "Big Blue" in the states because of their logo familiarly, grew up in a century to one of the greatest enterprises of the world.
It is one of the most varied technology-enterprises anyway - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, Hosting and consultation services in an incredible product width - from servers up to the nanotechnology.
From all American technology-enterprises IBM has most patents and already five of his employees were honored with the Nobel prize.
E.g. bank automats, credit cards, finance swap, bar code or also the floppy disk belong to his best known inventions.
With approx. 220 billion dollars of market value (Market capitalization) IBM was this year the second-largest technology enterprise (now according to Apple), at which it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations found the taste of the customers from today - for example the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or also the computers of IBM PC were unhappy jr.
"Business is based on the forward motion, therefore one must not "commit" oneself to the past emotionally", Samuel J. Palmisano thinks about that.
Therefore IBM does not have any problem to build his foundation walls on different platforms - and to leave it also again when they do not function.
Unlike the opponent Microsoft who stands in the principle with his operating system Windows and falls.
Promising technologies
Services participate in the profits of IBM in greatest measure, software and hardware are involved to in each case a fifth.
Hardware with one was in this case in another 1990 more than fifty per cent part most strongly represent.
Since 2000 IBM disposed of few assets throwing off profit to the value of 15 billion dollars, invested at the same time it, however, 58 billion dollars into the purchase of future-pregnant technologies.
IBM goes on with these Investionen also after 2008 when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
Also here IBM, which increased his investment extent right in the great world economy crisis, remained loyal to the legacy of his first head Thomas J. Watson.
Up to now it shines, that the IBM enterprise survives the present crisis regardless of.
The value of the IBM-stocks went up since 2008 around 120 percent missile-like and the clear profit of the enterprise increases kontinuell.
The enterprise slogan of IBM says: everything can be changed - only the values not.
Also therefore it may be expected that this flexible giant masters also the next crisis.
IBM-history: Of the cheese tailor to cosmos flights
The a hundred years ago in New York founded IBM society (International business Machines) had at the beginning a quite complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took over the IBM name only in 1924 - initially it was a question of a brand denomination for a subsidiary in Canada and South America.
The fusion put the foundation stone to the later IBM society from four enterprises whose history goes back until the eighties of the 19th century.
You had technologies as for example the famous pricking card clocks for the registration of the work beginning and end.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new enterprise, that to 1930 also the chairmanship in the supervisory board inne had.
And it was Flint who employed the head of the rival firm Thomas J. Watson so that this helped him with the management of the enterprise.
This Leader outshone even the founders of IBM then - the invincible culture and identity of the enterprise is based on Watson's ideas until today.
Watson guided the enterprise to 1952.
IBM, began as already the name betrays with the production and the marketing of all possible machines for the trade - of sausage-and cheese tailors, up to cash boxes.
In the first four decades in which Watson guided the company it doubled their turnovers on nine million dollars and the enterprise expanded little by little onto all continents.
It was so indispensable to Watson for the company that he sat for whole forty years in the chief armchair only then he became from his son, removed Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his management IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also the first programming language developed.
In the sixties flights helped technician and computer from IBM of the NASA with leading into the space - to the Mercury and Saturn and in the year 1969 also the famous flight of the human being to the moon.
Meanwhile IBM developed in the year the first computer family with same computer architecture in 1964 - the row of IBM System/360.
A classical PC which determined the computer-standard of that time came to the market in the year 1981 under the name of IBM 5150.
Twenty years later IBM disposed to the Chinese society Lenovo of his computer production, on the other hand she bought, however, the consultant part of the enterprise PricewaterhouseCoopers and she got fully with that and very into the business with consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy, that IBM in the last three years is been worthwhile the draft "Smarter Planet".
The intention to use technologies in clever way in fields up to now not even planned embodies it e.g. also for the improvement of the situation in the traffic and in the city administration.
In the commercial sector IBM imported recently the platform "Smarter Commerce" which is supposed to help the traders with leading the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history also in Czechia.
In already 1932 IBM founded a subsidiary in the former Czechoslovakia - as a first country in central and east Europe.
Today IBM ČR practices among other things also a strategic outsourcing center in Brünn.
The headquarters for central and east Europe settles in Prague and here there is also a top team of researchers of world level, that dealt with the technology of the voice recognition.
