Boeing draws record task ashore from 18 trillion dollars
Airline emirates orders 50 double-threaded airplanes of the type of Boeing 777 with an option onto 20 more airplanes.
In addition Boeing six sells Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business, to the value of more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare information that an enterprise gets a task above 50 pieces of his products.
But it is a big business, when the enterprise of the airplane manufacturers Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 airplanes lies in total with a record sum of 18 trillion dollars.
The customer of Boeing is just as unusual: the Middle East, a wachsende gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a prediction which was published on Monday the Chicagoer enterprise reckons that Fluggesellschaften needs 2,520 airplanes from the Middle East in the coming 20 years to the value of 450 trillion dollars.
Boeing announced at the weekend his greatest task of all times for commercial airplanes, measured by the value of the order: 50 double-threaded Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer task came of the airline emirate from Dubai.
The airline in addition has, so Boeing announced it in 2011 on the Dubai aviation show, an option onto the purchase of 20 more airplanes that makes to the entire list price climb 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday Boeing Oman Air six ordered then aloud Boeing 787-8, the so genannten Dreamliner which improves the mileage and the comfort of the passengers enormously.
The list price for six of these airplanes is near more than 1 trillion dollars.
"That is absolute positively for Boeing", said Neal Dihora, stock exchange specialist of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
There are many airlines of the Middle East in the possession of the countries producing oil.
Therefore they do not have only the money in order to pay the airplanes. Rather a rise of the oil prices that normally damages the airlines since this of one of their biggest matters of expense is is not so harmful since the country deserves at a higher oil price.
That is important, since she said less to airplane orders than other airlines for this purpose tend, to cancel or to postpone if the oil prices increase Dihora.
"You have a natural safeguard", he said.
The order of emirate confirms Boeings leadership position on the market for jumbo jets and it helps to hold the airbus competitor to SAS in chess that attacks the supremacy with the A350.
Boeings victory on the aviation show comes four months after airbus announced one would postpone the introduction of the largest A350 which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One postponed the introduction in order to gain more confidence after the customers had demanded a higher working load and range.
The Boeing-stocks increased about 1.5% to $ 67.94.
