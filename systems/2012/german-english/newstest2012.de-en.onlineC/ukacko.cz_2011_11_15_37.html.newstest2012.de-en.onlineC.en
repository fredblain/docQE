EU ambassadress Vicenová:
The Czechs have the call of Negativisten and euro sceptics
"The contract of Lisbon brought the balance noticeably of the plumbline under the single institutions."
I would not have expected that such hard war breaks out."
"It becomes to five, six years" Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassadress near the European Union, quite sharply their lecture at the Juridical Department, began "to last until the waves will polish themselves and "will have become accustomed to their new role all".
How she takes the motto seriously "via Europe "Understandably and openly showed it already in the first part of their lecture in which she succeeded in describing to the EU and to their mutual relationships onto one the single organs such a clear and understandable manner that some reader of the Juridical department of the Karlsuniversität would have it for that can envy.
Ms Vicenová praised in this case also the new constant chairperson of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"At the beginning criticism became loud, it is too inconspicuous - a gray official that did not grow to such a role, but I must say it left without all the breath as he took care of the thing well.
"He is a human being that manages it to communicate with them to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently and that has particularly clear ideas of how it is supposed to go on with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and security politics declared it then in response to the question: Who that is actually - the European Union? Which number I am supposed "to call"?, therefore as an important step to the agreement and better readability the EU politics opposite states, as e.g. China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our Ölmützer Quargel
Ms Vicenová dedicated herself also to the agenda, according to which the European Union lived, lives and to live in near future proposes.
The Czech chairmanship of two years ago described they as success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and organized also the summit conference for Eastern Partnership.
She referred to the case of the government during the chairmanship as large Negativum which damaged the image of the Czech Republic strongly.
The Czech representation in the EU has to do currently all hands fully.
Said with the words of the ambassadress, it presented itself quite hectic not only with the chairmanship, but also during the subsequent crisis which is not overcome until today yet.
And there the EU must be approved of still the seven year budget, what the thing just because of the present economical situation does a lot complicated.
Whether it of a slender and economical budget becomes which branches of trade receive priority which countries more and which one less are supported - all this stands now on the agenda.
The ambassadress reminded also of their own slogans with which it came to Brussels: "Understandable above Europe".
"If I do not like something, it is horrible abbreviations, external words and jargon, then that does not understand anybody.
As I am supposed to know as a citizen actually, whether one in Brussels really crooked or round cucumbers and thinks out different large bananas or whether anyone wants to forbid us the Quargel in fact.
It would have used the ground of the EU also gladly for in order to get more Czechs into European institutions.
To Europe of the two of them or different speeds in prospect
In opinion of the EU ambassadress the Czechs stand in the call, to be a euro sceptic, that more the negative ones, perceive as the positive pages of the thing.
The weak representation of Czechs is the more annoyed in European Institutions.
At that many factors are guilty, among other things also the restraint of our candidates, whose impotence, to write motivation letters and last but not least also the weak support of the Czech page.
Except for the successful Czech chairmanship it emphasized also the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad-Gruppe, the so-called V4.
"You believe me if one comes to Pole or to Hungarian to me and is a Slowake near the Frenchman means then next to me: "He, what connects her the heads there - that is already again your V4?" and in this case a quite acid expression does.
According to Ms Vicenové the EU in future expect particularly hard rules for the budget-politics of the member states.
As much more real, she sees the draft of a Europe as a "European confederation" the two or really different speeds at.
"We have the countries of the euro zone and the countries off the euro zone here.
"We have the Schengen-room and we have already the institute of a confirmed cooperation."
"For the first time it was said that only the countries are supposed to cooperate that want it and that, that do not want it are supposed to stand quiet off."
"There will be more and more of such institutions which finally comes to a strong Europe of the different speeds", expects Ms Vicenová.
In this respect she appreciated the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the basic principle also for the role, according to which all topics with effect on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states and not only of the countries of the euro zone.
