The CDU suggests to elect the EU president due to general voice delivery
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday that 14th November went by in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, chancellor and chairperson of the Christian-democratic party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was not initially planned in the program, but it continued in the fall, in particular around that activist it suffices to achieve, that the government politics with regard to the Greeks today and possibly of Italy tomorrow than to assess too laxly.
The premiership request of the European Commission suggested by the executive committee was accepted almost one-consistently.
Among 1001 delegatees only nine had voted against that, ten had abstained.
The Standing ovation several minutes continuous that due to their intervention decrees Angela Merkel as well as some hours meant for Wolfgang Schäuble later first of all lieβen on the part of the three Europe-inclined Ministers of Finance of no doubts open.
The main idea of the chancellor supports - in the same way as that one Offer - following slogan: the answer to the crisis lautet"nicht less, but more Europe".
Not only, because Europe means peace, but also da"neun millions of jobs directly of the euro are dependent".
Ist"die time for a breakthrough come" for the chancellor in Europe.
This could be expressed in the euro zone through a modification of the Lisboan contract with regard to the budget politics of the countries confirming the control of the European Union; in the same way this, however, could lend" in the choice of the president of the European Commission on basis general voice delivery münden",um Europe a face.
This is, however, in any case one of the request proposals adopted by the congress to which Wolfgang Schäuble godfather stood unequivocally.
Certainly the 47 of them are only little likely to agree rapidly on this revolution: Groβ-Britannien is stands the thing refusingly opposite, and the leading ones of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy of the same opinion is to know.
The milestone is, however, put.
In the same way the delegatees refused the proposal of the weighting of every country in an overwhelming majority in the EZB executive board according to the weighting of the single Ökonomien, which would bring a strengthening of the position of Germany with themselves obviously.
The chancellor, concerned about smoothing of the climate within their party, intensified therefore the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. She did not attempt, however, more, their congress at the expense of der"kleinen" or the in trouble contained European countries win, that would criticize the arrogant Germany immediately.
So far the Europe request of the importance der"deutsch-French friendship" a section dedicates, Angela Merkel Frankreich does not call onto the plan.
At least not direct.
Because this reminds of Leipzig two centuries ago standing in the center of a bloody battle.
Actual one of the defeats of the Napoleonic army humiliating most at the very top.
