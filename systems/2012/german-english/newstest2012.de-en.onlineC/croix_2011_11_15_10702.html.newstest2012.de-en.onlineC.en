North stream, new gate to Russian gas in Europe
The gas conduit north stream, that goes by on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects the western Europe directly with Russia, sat down in operation.
It is supposed to supply gas for an equivalent from 30 million budgets.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to inspect this event with shine and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, under that four State- and heads of the government have attended, last Tuesday at the Baltic Sea coast under Orchesterbeschallung and with gourmand buffet of the opening of the new gas conduit that unites Russia and Germany below sea-level directly with each other north stream.
The German chancellor Angelika Merkel, the Russian president Dmitri Medwedew, the French prime minister François Fillon as well as his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands turned symbolischerweise together the steering wheel of the valve which carries the Russian gas to the west-European net.
With the new gas conduit Western Europe is supposed to be delivered by a first pipeline 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per annum from 1,224 km according to length that connects the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, the one package of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allows, is supposed to be finished at the end of 2012.
And one makes already the contingency of the construction of a third management on same stretch be heard.
For Gazprom the punctual and point-exact finishing of this enormous construction as a victory works.
The project was strongly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The north stream pipeline will facilitate a direct gas delivery same to Germany, and indeed under avoidance of any route course through third countries (Poland or Ukraine) on the country road.
For this reason these two countries lose a little of their power: For them it becomes now more difficult to exert pressure on Russia when they threaten to close the admission to west-European markets.
Warsaw, most strongly engaged in the debate, had not zurückgescheut before comparing the north stream pipeline with a "new deutsch-sowietischen pact" in connection at the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in the year 1939.
This means that the topic is politically seenly äuβerst sensitive.
Western Europe gained an even higher supply security through the advocation of this Russian project.
This, however, energy European at the expense of a weakening, since the project beat a breach between west and east Europeans.
Russia did not finish it in hardly five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western countries, that show strong gas consumption and their gas occurrences for the end go, to put through.
"This gas conduit is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that unites us in organic way" confirmed François Fillon during the opening of the gas conduit when it referred to that in which degree the groβen gas contracts also of political and economical page are important.
All this declares the wide smile of the Gazprom managers in Lubmin numerously represented with regard to the gas inlet.
The construction of this gas conduit is also an exceptional technique.
The underwater management consists of steel with concrete coating which is supposed to protect her against anchors.
It rests on the seabed, in about 200 m of depth.
Near their construction dating mine fields had to be avoided from the Second World War.
"About hundreds of mines had "to become" as a precaution away or destroyed", Jens gave miller, speaker of the society north stream.
Increasing Maβnahmen to the protection of the fauna and flora had to be caught to Auβerdem.
The management is a long snake of metal, heavily as 242 Eiffel Tower, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither through valves, still maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned before the coast of Sweden, however, the project persons responsible refrained from that since the Swedes were keen on seeing a Russian state society settling on height of their coasts in permanent way to little.
"In the case of an average we close the gas passage in less than one minute", Müller specified Jens.
In the case of a leakage that escapes in the gas conduit contained gas therefore into the air.
This case is regarded as only little probable, however, by the constructing engineers, there the Schweiβnähte onto a permanence of a leakage per 100,000 years was estimated.
The state supervision of the gas conduit is guaranteed by an underwater robot that is operated to external observation purposes from a sea-going vessel both as also of a device that circulates in the interior of the gas conduit.
It has the form of a cigar, miβt a meter of diameters, is introduced in the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of the moving through the management with a speed of 3 meters per second, the device supplies with his arrival most exact information about possible deformations of the metal.
The gas conduit was designed in order to function for fifty years without having to be subjected also to only the least repair.
The gas circulation is very simply guaranteed through pressure.
This is in 200 cash at the Admission-, 100 cash at the exit place.
Five societies united their strengths for the realization of this project.
The wiring stays, however, in the hand of Gazprom which holds 51% of the parts.
The German societies E. ON and BASF keep on being attached here (each to 15.5%), in the same way as the Dutch Gasunie and the French company group of GDF Suez (each to 9%).
These five societies formed an enterprise community that north is mentioned stream and that is charged the construction as well as company of the gas conduit.
It has their seat in train in Switzerland, where the taxation is especially favorable.
Gazprom let out then the entire capacity of their gas transportation to this society, and indeed onto verlängerbaren twenty year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless as groβ that one in a real way transports gas amount turns out", specified Jens millers.
The financing of the gas conduit construction was protected to 30% of stockholders as well as to 70% by bank loans.
The entire labor costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez the amount to be invested was for example 240 million.
The minority stockholders are, however, gewiβ, to bring in their expenses again since Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas conduit is revealed at a coastal strip sandy, wooded with pines at Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meters high valves form the gas escape gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and further identification numbers of the arriving gas before this is seen into the German gas conduits.
Since last Tuesday this terminal is supplied with a million cubic meters of Russian gas per hour passing by.
At full capacity these would be 3 million cubic meters per hour as well as 6 million in the year 2012.
