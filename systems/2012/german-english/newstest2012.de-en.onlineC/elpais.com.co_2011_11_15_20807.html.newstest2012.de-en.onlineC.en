What did the candidate del Valle lack in order to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected that that Melina Ramírez Serna got the crown of the Miss Colombia not.
El Valle receives his 14th Misstitel.
Again once Valle del Cauca went out emptily during the allocation of the crown for Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to give itself in a satisfied way with that to stand on the winner podium to set a silver crown and the band that expels it as a new Miss Colombia for the show.
With the result preserved this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and that took Zeder onto himself, the Departamento comes already to 14 Misstitel and Melina goes along with the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in the hands. Belonging to the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The great question that many ask today says: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the downfall of a big favorite that had shown with every demonstration that she decreed above all in order to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing it had been chosen for the queen of the police and for the Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that also the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had received and that the crown of the Miss Colombia with home took.
To appoint the first factor to be regarded as decisive for the decision of the jury it to the First Miss is, that they the answer to the question "Of which one book influenced you most strongly and why"? that had been put to her from the Carreta Literaria Leamos by Martín Murillo Gómez, not had convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the interrogator:
"I read a lot I quite believe in the literature I believe, a kind is to be civilized, ultimately I believe, that the book that shaped for my childhood most strongly `The small prince' is ", a book going quite deeply.
At the time of I read `Fault and atonement'. It is a book of the universal culture which we all should read. I read just a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a wonderful book, the `Leidenschaften'heißt.
An answer that bumped onto little approval firstly because of the concept zivilisieren' and secondly, because it had not declared actually in which way every book named by her had influenced it.
But on completion of the ceremony Melina declared to feel quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens, which must happen.
And for all people: Read please a little `The small prince'. It is a splendid book.
Among other things it is said that the darling of El Valle burned out.
A journalist from Bogotá pointed out, that the fact that she "was" the preferred "one" that collected all Beifälle and that previously had gotten all prices (Gastronomy competition Oster, public vote about the best hand-tailored costume and Reina Madre) that had made jealous to other candidates, which the queen that therefore could not shine on the stage stresste."
And one noticed that during their first idea in the swimsuit at the beach of the Hilton-hotel and at their two elevators during the coronation celebration.
Although it surely occurred at both of them, it lacked nevertheless the strength and the swing which the representatives put from Magdalena and Atlántico for the show.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" with the channel RCN meant, that the fact that Melina was crowned the Miss, "it shows that nevertheless finally the candidate that gains most prices during the competition does not become queen".
In addition Valle avoided at the end of the press - an error.
A further hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the Jurie concerning their interest in the social work which is the essential Thing of the National Beauty Competition ultimately.
It will have already his reason that two days in front of the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty declared they searched a woman who committed herself to the social matters of their country.
"Beauty alone does not suffice to Colombia for a Miss. One must look over the physical thing and concentrate on the social opinion, on her having cooperated in the competition at projects already before the participation" she declared.
Also speculates, that Valle with their defects of the Derriere and the Fibrose that one noticed of her in the stomach region had sinned. But that is inconsistent, because the jury elected her as a candidate for `natural beauty' with a healthy body, good feeding habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that it improves that Melina did not have the best body, "however their problem with the Fibrose at the stomach" would give ", that for me honestly said hardly was to be noticed, their dot number pressed on the last day."
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos thinks the surgical interventions to which she had subjected herself were the error of the woman from Valle del Cauca.
"The operations are ok, but Valle did not know how she should make her be made correct.
Your body has never been their strong page, and she had to pay to this place."
Because of this price which is awarded the first time of the National Beauty Competition a cruel forecast which should become true in the night arose after the appearance in the swimsuit. People whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize in order not to make her into the pleasure come to the crown.
Identical, whether that is right or not, fact is that Melina enters upon their domination year from today indeed not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the possibility to represent on appointment of the National beauty competition Colombia at one of the international competitions.
However, it will come in as one of the queens which in spite of their overwhelming appearance for Cartagena the crown had escaped into the history.
