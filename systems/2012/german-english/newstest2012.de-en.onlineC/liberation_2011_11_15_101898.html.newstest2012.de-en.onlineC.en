Energy politics:
Facts should triumph over dogmas
A topic exists, that on basis of short-term considerations or due to emotions must not be handled, so this is certainly the energy politics.
Availability and costs of the electricity influence the purchasing power as well as the competitiveness of the enterprises in direct Maβe.
It is reasonable to take a choice meeting as the reason to think about this topic as well as about the position of the nuclear energy.
The debate will bear only then fruits when she probes the entirety of economical, social and ecological consequences of the suggested options.
The French should their opinion on objective facts, rational data found.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution drives forward a doubling of the electricity demand up to the year 2050, if an enormous part of the world population is not supposed to have to renounce a vital element.
Simultaneously one must moderate the shortage of the fossil resources in order to keep on being able to produce electricity continuously without forgetting the compelling necessity for the decrease of the hothouse gas emissions, a topic disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic Unregelmäβigkeiten.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Kept on being isolated therefore blebt Germany in his decision to renounce nuclear power.
Neither this is not the case in Belgium, which subjects his decision of the necessity to find a substitution-capable replacement source, in the Switzerland which once just intends only still to build nuclear power plants of the last generation yet.
Groβbritannien, Finland, poles, the Czech Republic, that Netherlands, Swedes, South Africa, China, India and Brazil in order to name only some states on the other hand their projects keep on pursuing with determination.
The United States decided for her part according to Fukushima on attaching a further unit to their park in their taking the work Three Mile Island deactivated after the nuclear accident once again in operation.
Also when the onto renewable sources of energy achieved, German model sometimes than model is put down, so the reality contradicts, however, the discourse.
The choice in Berlin knocks down in the form of a rise in price of the electricity price, an energetic dependence intensified by the increased resort to import gas in particular on Russia, a rise that through gas and coal power stations of caused CO2 emissions.
The entirety of these joyless effects will become noticeable already within few months.
The case Denmark gives reason to the contemplation.
Denmark is on the one hand European table leader with regard to wind energy from which it gets 30% of his electricity, on the other hand the country is, alternately used with wind energy, to one of the strongest users of coal and gas; aufgrunddessen his CO2 outputs as well as his electricity price are each about 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European mean.
Thanks to the permanence of our energy politics our neighbors pay one unlike our French budgets around 40% of higher electricity bill.
Since the energy price represents a decisive role of the competitiveness as well as a stability pledge of the industry on national ground in the globalisierten economy, the französichen enterprises have an advantage due to the most favorable electricity in Europe.
Every significant reduction concerning the nuclear power would involve therefore a strong growth of the energy price, which would make become the noble statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of the purchasing power for the illusion.
Inquiries showed that that one is a price that to pay the groβe majority of the French in the same way little is ready as recognize it resistance to the principle of this source of energy makes.
We Vergegenwärtigen ourselves that the energy politics of our country facilitated it a branch of industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs build up.
Due to their strong export character it brings a vast quantity of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises onto the international markets and this turns into creator of innumerable jobs.
France should understand the decision to get out of the nuclear power, so a Groβteil would fall victim to that to this KMU, and the annual 6 billion euros onto capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would charge an EPR designed for the functioning onto sixty years if the downfall of his producer is programmed?
Around the energetic equation one must grant to solve, that it just as little one as a devil work gives a miracle means for the production of electricity.
The solutions developed by the company Areva, CO2-poor to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy show the Komplementarität of the sources of energy.
To receive the highest possible security level uprightly is an absolute imperative for the nuclear power.
In France we have a law enforcement agency which carries out uncompromising and transparent controls in already existing works as for example at the construction in Flamanville.
Their teams who made themselves a name due to their professionalism are just too proprietary from the security idea.
Within 50 years the nuclear industry experienced three fatal breakdowns.
Only an only, and indeed in Three Mile Island, kicked in under normal operating conditions; so it went by without consequences for human being and environment.
In Chernobyl the drama was caused by reactor construction as well as unendschuldbares, human failure.
At Fukushima some seem to forget that the accident of extent from two natural catastrophes never been was caused that the death of several ten thousand people caused.
The nuclear industry will draw their lessons just the same from this accident as she had done this after the two preceded ones.
As a fruit of this approach as well as a cooperation of the law enforcement agencies of the French and German operators and constructing engineers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that makes resistance for him possible opposite such phenomena.
Since it is taken as desirable among the electrotechnicians to build a nuclear power plant, so a construction stop would be a fabulous present in Flamanville onto the competition of Areva and EDF, when one would let them free railways, to tear the leadership position onto himself in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is unavoidable and legitimate to search for the best energy bouquet for our country, however, it would be irresponsible to make emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber who determines just as economical, social and financial situation of our country dominate a debate.
