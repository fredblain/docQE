Walls have eyes: Observing you as researchers on Facebook
Before he became the new face of the right extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was only one of many Jungs who their anti-immigration opinion in an online way sent.
On Monday having inspected Breivik which stood at an amok race in Norway in July at which 77 people were killed had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik alone likes to have acted, it is not alone by far in the Cyberspace: He transferred a lot of time up to his attack before his computer and with some of the millions of nationalists gechattet, that support right-extreme groups on pages of social networks.
According to the tragedy of this summer researchers wanted to find the way out more about these people.
However, how does one find it?
That is easy - one must login only at Facebook.
"We stated that it was not heavy to come to them", says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently appeared report of the British idea factory DEMOS over the digital populism's in Europe.
Facebooks cache of personal data is so encyclopedic, it says to Bartlett that the researchers must simply use the advertising-tool of the page in order to define their wanted demographic data with scientific accuracy exactly - be for Vermarkter so as it for years.
Bartletts team found half a million of fans of right-extreme groups in whole Europe and aimed for it then with Adds, nevertheless to link with a new band or a new diet product instead of himself, the Adds invited users in whom their education state, their attitude opposite power and the assessment of their own future were asked for to an inquiry.
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were in the situation to consult more than 10,000 supporters of 14 extremely right parties in 11 European countries - without their having also had to leave their office only once.
"It is a quite new research method", says Bartlett.
Some of the results hardly surprise. Online conveyors of right-extreme groups are mostly young, masculine and are angry about the immigration.
But in a kind of surprising torsion are "those ones, who combine their online activism with an off-line activism more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those ones that sitzen bleiben behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is only an example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the page in order to study everything from health questions up to society trends as in "Likes", plaintext messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that three contents add on average per day Facebooks "Data supernova" generates a research boom that made the number of the scientific works with the name increase to this page in the title in the last five years around almost 800%.
For some researchers the beautiful thing of Facebook is the fact that one can study through this page people who one does usually not reach with his clipboard on the street.
"If you attempted formerly to consult people of the British national party, it was very heavy to identify it."
"You had to inform the party first and that one would never have given them admission", says Bartlett.
"At Facebook that all is omitted - they go directly to them."
Others say that the page offers a possibility social health problems to recognize and to solve.
A current study of Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and their colleagues' has found out that students that discussed their full drunkenness on Facebook tend to the problem-drinking significantly more strongly than students that kept quiet about this topic.
Moreno suggests, that control equally ranked students, for example living-consultants, the page and help a student, when this too much status updates postet.
"You can not solve a problem if you have not recognized it", told Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co-author and ladder of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research institutes in Seattle of the Washington mail.
"We found a possibility to identify endangered children who would not have been found differently."
Facebook taps in addition constantly the data of his own population.
The data team of the page created statistics of the relationship status and Valentine's Day, poll at the Zwischenwahlen 2010 and a National luck index (at which in the first place information were used onto which only Facebook Zugriff has - masters of the digital freedom know for a long time that the page should turn their big data treasure trove into research purpose accessibly for others.)
Nevertheless the users of Facebook know that she observes the page whether they want that now or not. Around with a friend, to be able to play Scrabble the thousands' of miles is removed, one allows the page to lower the own personal data.
But what, when the users of Facebook become Teil an inquiry, from which they do not know even something yet?
While researchers are having severely defined guidelines as they gather their data in an off-line way, everything is allowed in an online way.
"I do not believe that many users thought anyway about the fact about a researcher being able to study their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London knowledge rennet, for a study from the year 2006 in which he examined the public pages of students for Facebook.
"What affects it, it was a question only of them and their friends."
Then there is still the question of the methodology.
In an even off-line way there is not any guarantee, that a research participant is completely honest.
On Facebook it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What one says on Facebook and two completely different things are what one does outside of Facebook,", Selwyn says.
Therefore Selwyn thinks in spite of his years as technology researchers that a clipboard and a convent are still the best research tools which everyone can use.
"There is not any substitute for that, into which to exceed real world and to speak with real people", he says.
"Social research must worry around the social thing - and every amount of social life occurs in a still off-line way."
