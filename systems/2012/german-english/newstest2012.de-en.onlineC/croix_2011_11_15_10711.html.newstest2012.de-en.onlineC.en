Why does the unemployment rate of handicapped employees remain on so high level?
About 19% of the handicapped persons are in search of a job.
Today die"15 begins. Week of the work for disabled persons".
In spite of an objective-conscious public politics which was introduced in the year 2005 the unemployment rate is always twice as high with handicapped persons as the average average is: 19% towards 9% of Arbeitlosigkeit of the total population.
Discouraging?
"Refusal", so emphatically Éric Blanchet, president of the union Adapt which adjusts the "week of the work for disabled persons"."
"The progress achieved within fifteen years is considerable."
"Then the unemployment rate was so high not twice, but three times."
"Nonetheless it remains to do a lot still enormously."
It must be said, however, that for handicapped unemployed persons numerous obstacles keep on living on before they get a job.
More frequently it affects the older people: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average) are.
You have a small qualification level: 80% of them do not have any school-leaving examination and there are only 10,000 disabled persons under the 2.3 million students with higher education end.
Also the long-term unemployment is End-Final very much widespread: 53% with the disabled persons opposite 38% in the total cut.
In a word there are so many criteria that complicate a renewed work entrance, and that "form" the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, president of Tremplin, a union founded in 1992 that in this case it is helpful to enterprises to recruit handicapped employees.
So much to the objective brakes.
Stays the unspoken, the states of mind, that indeed certain, nevertheless develop, however, slowly.
A study carried out by the union IMS-Entreprendre in April for the magazine La Cité indicated the consulted managers have "a weak knowledge level concerning disabled persons" that "ueberrepraesentiert" is "from persons in rotation chairs, psychologically or intellectually inferior-well-to-do".
Result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees have another wide way for themselves around the employment aim of employee hindered from 6% that was stipulated by 1987 in a law of achieving.
These numbers last-named, coming from the year 2008 refer to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now at around the 3%", Pierre Blanc, president of Agefiph, the organization that it is charged that to drive in contributions from enterprises that disregard this law, tells.
The evidence: Firms' "paying the Zahl"Gebühren" has just as as the sum of the amounts between 2007 and 2011 paid in reduces, and zahlenmäβig indeed of 59,000 on 46,000 (and of 606 on 480 million euros).
"The law of 2005, which contribution increases designates, got a strong pressure onto the enterprises, declared Pierre Blanc."
"But this improvement expresses also a real discovery in particular with the groβen company groups."
According to the ministry for work only 59% of the firms employ between 20 and 49 employees handicapped employees, enterprise with 100 to 199 employees on the other hand 82%.
