The scandal bank of the Zürisee
The most adventurous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went in the financial crisis almost bankruptly and slides since then into the next one from a crisis.
Now a German is supposed to do.
So Axel Weber had surely not thought it.
After his spectacular departure of the top of the Federal Reserve it had become known in July that he would enter upon an almost just as spectacular new job in 2013: Board of directors president of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was pleased in public, Switzerland praised whether their beauty and the UBS whether their again gained solidness and made friendly remarks fall about the future colleagues.
"The UBS created the Turnaround".
"I look forward to the cooperation with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
However already in September it realized that everything would come very differently.
A trader of the UBS in London had avoided all standby systems of the bank and about 1.7 billion euros verzockt.
UBS executive board leader Oswald Grübel, a banker not praised only in Switzerland, had to go.
The board of directors president of the UBS is regarded since then also as hit - and all ask: When does Axel Weber come at last?
Already it became known that Weber may advise the bank from February 2012.
And it takes over the board of directors chairmanship already in May - not only in the year 2013, as the bank on Tuesday informed.
For Axel Weber that hardens.
He is not a banker, rather economics professor and note banker and a training period would have had certainly necessarily.
With a stroke it takes over the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that just once again proved then that they longest the title "largest scandal bank of Europe" deserves.
Because the UBS is on the one hand gigantic - until recently she was the tallest property manager of the world - and on the other hand for years slides into the next one from a scandal.
Nothing, it seems like this, keeps on being spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
To 2007 the UBS had an excellent call.
She had combined the image of the hidden and sound one, but also ausgebufften Schweizer property manager with ambitious objectives: It wanted to become a very great number also in the investment banking.
On the one hand so the UBS administered in 2007 more money of wealthy customers with 1.6 trillion dollars than any other bank of the world.
And on the other hand it had moved on as an investment bank into the league of the biggest banks of the world.
That did impression.
The former banker and later long-standing bank professor told in Zurich Hans Geiger: "I then always posed my students the UBS as patterns of a good bank."
"From present view one asks to oneself: How could I me only so mad"?
He was mistaken tremendously.
In the year 2007 it became for the first time apparent that something went wrong appropriately in the UBS.
In the middle of the year executive board leader Peter Wuffli who until then was regarded as a highly-intellectual and just as brilliant banker stepped surprisingly back.
Some months later one foresaw, why it had gone.
The investment section of the bank had itself with subprime-papers verzockt and had to refuse an invitation from billions.
In order to shoulder that, the UBS canceled a capital increase at the level of of says and write 13 billion francs.
For that she found in fact investors, however which one which some would have turned up the nose at until shortly before still: an intransparenten Asiatic state fund from Singapore and an Arabian state fund that it was so hidden that one did not find out even his name.
However, that was only the first stroke.
In April 2008 it came more badly.
The bank had to announce new billion losses, board of directors president Marcel Ospel, 2006 still that at the second-best one paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: The UBS stood faced with their misinvestments in the financial crisis before the breakdown and had to be saved by the state.
The National Bank bought billions of problematic securities from the UBS for zig, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond issue, over which they could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how it is dramatically for a small country if it houses so large banks.
Finally the balance-sheet total of the UBS 2007 was more than five times as great as the economic achievement of Switzerland was (see graphic).
"Once again we could not save the UBS", says bank researcher violinist.
To the first disaster the second connected herself.
Already few months on that the UBS capitulated in the tax quarrel with America and declared itself readily to hand over the data of wealthy customers which had evaded taxes possibly with the aid of the bank.
Furthermore she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these businesses along with punishment impact.
In this way the UBS admitted to have helped with the tax evasion freely more or less.
Simultaneously she lost something, that always had been their capital in the competition around rich customers: the nimbus of the discretion.
According to the scandal the Swiss banker's discretion was not the same one anymore.
It the resignation followed from executive board leader and board of directors president.
And the exodus of customer deposits.
So the bank had lost within less months their plausibility in both central business areas: in the investment banking through the blemish speculations and in the property administration through the help for the tax evasion.
And just than it became again a little quieter, just than one thought there this unblissful trader history follows now the UBS will manage it already again: A single trader verzockt 1.7 billion euros, before the bank notices that something goes wrong.
And it becomes apparent: It does not work with the risk management in the investment banking obviously still.
"With the case Adoboli one had had to state that the risk control changed into little", says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institution of the Zurich university.
Also the finance executive board of a large Deutsche Bank is sure: "The problem of the UBS is that she does not have the risk control under control."
Nevertheless in this case it had been the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers a long time ago had lined up exactly to become guardian of the big properties of the world: no far too great risks, for that security for the money - the world liked to collapse also beyond the alp republic once.
The safes of the Swiss banks had become the symbol for unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli for especially noble chocolate.
The headquarters of the UBS in Zurich still matches the cliche of the high-quality Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classical.
The bank wears their head office the inhabitant of Zurich railway station trasses' that leads from the central station directly to the Zurich lake that is framed from the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the loading rents belong to the highest in Europe.
One finds jewelers as Tiffany's here between Swiss tradition businesses as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries the Swiss banks are residing here: of the National Bank about the palace the Credit Suisse up to elitist private banks as Julius Bär.
One enters the reception hall of the UBS through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are marble-lined, before that thick leather armchairs stand, next to the bank logo a big sign to the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer searches here: Security.
Both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, replaced this idea of the Swiss bank sometime, however - or betray how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
His names he would not like to read more gladly in the newspaper finally it, as all Swiss bankers, does businesses also with the two big banks.
The UBS became much too large, he thinks - particularly in the investment banking, where furthermore the Anglo-Saxons would have expanded.
The Swiss would not have to say anything more there.
"And when nevertheless, they adapted themselves to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons for a long time."
The Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed the UBS was it actual to her first high profits gave and then the collapse: No European finance institute lost as much money in the subprime-jungle as the Swiss big bank did.
On 15th October 2008 the disaster became visible.
"On that Wednesday the government coalition of the small seven million country concluded the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS-crash".
The politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros in order to save the big bank standing before the bankruptcy.
How could it result in that?
If one speaks with Swiss bankers, they see the problem like this particularly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three Swiss big banks joined to a tremendous company group.
A bank arose that was too big already during the fusion for the small Switzerland - and always further increased.
It helped with that that the two different precursor-banks of the UBS complemented themselves: a rich, however, overslept bank with the emphasis property administration into Zurich and a poorer, however, already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalized investment bankers came favorably onto a lot of money with which they could turn a gigantic wheel.
Two names are combined to the UBS with this rise: Peter Wuffli, of 2001 to 2007 company group leader the UBS, and Marcel Ospel, then chairperson of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team", says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high intellectual, modest that knows about models and statistics a lot, and Ospel, the stomach human being that plowed from the bank lesson up to very above."
But Ospel relied to the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli at the end probably made a decisive error: "He thought his models are the reality", says Geiger.
"That is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
Clear is: High spirits came before the case.
Employees of the UBS remember clearly the manager-meetings on which company group leader Wuffli distributed the same motto again and again: Pushing Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank of the earth.
She led the "League Tables", the ranking lists that documented the success of the banks of that time.
There the UBS wanted, very up.
Some steps were already successful to her.
In the foreign exchange business and in the share trading it played very above.
Management consultants that were charged emphasized, however, a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banker language "Fixed Income", there is a tremendous distance to the biggest banks.
The UBS has gaps with American mortgage products.
In order to fill this gap, UBS went into an adventure which cost it to almost the existence.
Hungrily for growth, both the bank itself and a Hedgefonds founded before it invested in American subprime-installations.
It developed into a tremendous machine that packed securities onto American mortgage credits and passed them on - in this case, however, also even risks kept.
Also still, than other banks searched the exit for a long time.
"Still in the summer 2007, when the American property market in flames stood, the UBS bought there", says Bankenexperte to violinist.
So large the euphoria, so deeply the case.
A manager after the other one had to go than the attempts to tidy up in a more difficult way turned out than thoughtly.
Posts at the UBS became the ejection seat and are until today wobbly.
Who leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank which lost all obvious business models.
Bank researcher violinist has already an idea: End with the investment banking, concentration on the property administration, return to the Swiss roots.
Very so far the bank does not want to go indeed (yet).
But the investment banking is supposed to shrink strongly, so much is now already clear.
On the coming Thursday the new bank leader Sergio Ermotti of the world wants to present his future strategy.
The 51 years old Italo-Swiss was thought actually only as interim solution when the bank separated from predecessor Grübel surprisingly.
In the meantime it continued: It is supposed to lead the businesses of the UBS permanently, Bank divided the inhabitants of Zurich on Tuesday with.
Ermotti wants to drive back the investment bank onto the state in the middle of the nineties.
It deletes 3500 places.
That will not suffice, however.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what does she want to earn money?
Those ones are the questions which Axel Weber surely now already asks to himself.
In public he only says up to now, it searches an apartment first with his wife once in Zurich.
Next year.
