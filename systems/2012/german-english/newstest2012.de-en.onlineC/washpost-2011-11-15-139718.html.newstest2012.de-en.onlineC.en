"Struck", "not "conquered", however", according to Giffords in the first TV interview after the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man had fired from next distance during a choice event in Tucson onto them the republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) occurred Monday evening in the national television. She only sang to the Broadway piece "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said, the wish, to recover it is larger than that one to return to the congress.
When it occurred together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC-news "20/20", she struggled for words and help needed during the walking.
The broadcasting showed the hard slow recovery of the damage which the ball caused which divides their skull, drills the left page of their brain and crossed their head from front up to behind.
Three months ago it returned surprisingly to the congress, around triumphing their voice to the fault brake give.
In their first TV interview after the assassination attempt in January in the case of which six people were killed and 13 hurt Gifford smiled, laughed and sang - and their convalescence as "difficult" described.
When Sawyer asked her how she feels, Gifford (41) answered: "Very good."
The interview with Gifford and their husband, the astronaut mark Kelly, part was of one one-hour "20/20"-Specials, that was recorded shortly before the publication of the new book of the married couple: "Gabby: A history above courage and hope."
The Special hunts Giffords convalescence since the assassination attempt of the 8th January.
In videos which Kelly had recorded in the first weeks one sees it in the hospital bed, with baldly shaved head and a long scarf above the forehead.
It can lift only one or two fingers if their husband encourages her to that.
Months later Giffords is in a rotation chair while therapists are showing her how she carries out simple movements.
A nodding with the head.
A twitch with that lips.
And then, their first words: "What."
After few days Giffords whispers a further word: "Toast". She would like, that their breakfast is changed.
Videos that are played in the ABC show point, that music an important role in Giffords 'Convalescence played: One sees" as the congress representative together with the therapists to Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Pettys "Free Fallin'" sings.
In the interview with Sawyer Giffords who spends two hours with therapy daily said that she can not remember the assassination attempt on the day.
Your husband said that he had read Giffords an article of a daily paper on 12th March about the assassination attempt than it interrupted it and asked for the first time for the six people that had been killed during the assassination attempt.
The probable shooter Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is treated compulsorily medically while he is waiting for his negotiations.
"Many people died", told Giffords Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
In the course of the convalescence of his wife, so Kelly Sawyer told, it said: "I was struck."
"Therefore, I would say: "Gabby, you were not "conquered"? Kelly said.
You were only struck.
And you stand that and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
