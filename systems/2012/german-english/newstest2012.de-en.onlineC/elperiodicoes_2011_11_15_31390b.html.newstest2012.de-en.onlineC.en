Park or mountain?
The architects are agreed on the announcement apart from the quarrels about the fees.
The urban announcement about the 16 gates starts the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona again.
In the middle of the 1980th years, to the climax of the meanwhile disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published their abusing-writing about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a gigantic park in Barcelona city.
It was compared even in numbers with the Central Park by New York.
With the fall of the CMB in the year 1987 the park became the upper limit of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia belongs to the few ones that does not expand in north south direction but up (Mountains) and below (Sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
Now no more the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the Yogibärs served as a model.
So far was one, as the city in September a giant announcement, existing from 16 competitions, for further access gates according to Collserola distributed.
Beyond doubt a fool refers to the draft of a park.
Either that is like this, or somebody plans to put gates on the country.
The question surrenders by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The announcement is the topic not only from organizational view, but also with regard to a reflection on the city in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
Already almost a recurrent topic is which two members of this caste in an old way resident that meets in the elevator can fall back to.
And exactly this fact offers the material for one of the rare correspondences between what three architects think about that from Barcelona, and some professors that applied onto the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The announcement is adequate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to speak after the attack onto the coast over the "front at the mountains", so far the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, that has been delivered aus over the green apples, not.
"One should take the principle as a basis, that Barcelona's biggest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is well accessible.
Collserola is more complex", the architect judges, for that of the titles a "lexical trap" in themselves "Gates from Collserola" brings out: One may they not "than accesses to a park introduce, but as a delimitation of fields on which must act."
Modol, as Roldán and Bayona with city-structural experience, considers the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" which contains "some dangers" in themselves.
Dangers due to the "insecurity, which brings the organization of a public room nowadays with itself" after the experiences from the 1980th years to have their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first apprehension is the own limitation to what may be built on.
"To delimit something always means to define the next step" that is to cross it.
"One must think about new city-structural planning instruments, because the present ones [with reference to the plan general Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol that sticks to the question more closely means, the page of Collserola that Vallesana goes in the direction simplifies "can" be understood "as a park, that in direction Barcelona not", and indeed for reasons topographical in that.
Modol reminds of there being already a study of the patronage de Collserola that should not bump onto deaf ears although it is thankful to the municipal administration that it gave his committee the possibility to participate in this project "at first sight".
In addition he says that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the escort letter that it makes for the architects possible to participate in the debate although he expresses his "doubts" about that whether this technical profile should instruct the multidisziplinären teams started up ("exactly the correct thing, he says) We architects should be only a tool."
Bayona points out that the answer to the question is complex in the heading of this article since in the announcement conditions a global view of Collserola is missing: "16 competitions were advertised in the cross-section", he, "on the axis mountains-sea", says. But there are not any profile perspectives which the field considers in his entirety."
That resulted at least in his case in his participating in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to that.
In his opinion the city should absolutely guarantee that the stripe is so equipped directly above the Ronda de Dalt in his whole length that a soft crossing arises between city and green belts.
