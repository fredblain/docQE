Darina Rychtářová above their unfaithful husbands:
Iveta - this donkey can keep you you, I do not want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now end is!
After their spouse Josef Rychtář (53) of the protector of Iveta Bartosová (45) had become their lover, Darina remained still the hope that Josef awakes from his pink dream and comes home.
However, now it is final past with the patience and for the further life she set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, however not more than my partner", declared D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová of the singer I. Bartosová had offered refuge in their own house, she would presumably not have remembered once in the dream how that with their husband ends.
As Iveta onto their pushing there after 30 days again aus- and back according to Říčany pulled, accompanied like Josef.
Yes it confessed even public, that he loves it.
Darina resigned with the time, yes it seemed even, as if she wants to make up with their unfaithful husband again - finally now, however, it gave him the race passport.
It is Rychytář regardless with whom his wife sleeps
If nevertheless Rychtář Iveta Bartosová in future should leave, he will surely receive pauper not open at home then.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to conclude his days in our common home, I will not hinausjagen it then."
"However not as an old donkey gotten lost more loved, but as a human being to whom I still have certain links" Ms Rychtářová betrayed; she also said, however, she separated from it already emotionally and insist only on mutual correctness.
The circumstance, that it of Darina the back door has bolted, Josef supports up to now with dignity.
"I respect the decision of my wife."
"I stay with Iveta together, nothing is changed at that."
"My wife wants a paper-marriage and I respect that."
"The company runs, I see to the repairs, the garden, the plot, I do the purchases."
"With Darina I talk in a very normal way, we do not divide only the bed now", J. Rychtář (the leaf) said Blesk.
If a new love wants to be searched to Darina, it does not want to hinder her at that then.
"We do not sleep with each other, therefore it is regardless to me whether she has a friend or who that is.
It is clear to me that that is my fault, I fell with Iveta in love and therefore I take over any responsibility.
