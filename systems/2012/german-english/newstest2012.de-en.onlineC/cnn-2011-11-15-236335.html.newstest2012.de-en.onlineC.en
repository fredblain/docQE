ADB pushes Asia onto help in the rescue of the euro zone
The development bank of Asia (Asian Development Bank, ADB) appeals to India and China to support the rescue of the euro zone in his hard fault crisis in order to prevent a long-term downward trend which will slow down the growth of the economy of Asia.
Rajat Nag, administration manager of the ADB with seat in Manila, said that the two of them must be most quickly for wachsenden economic nations of the world "everything standing in your power" in order to speed up the recovery of the currency block either through the International Currency Ground or through direct mutual agreements.
It warned against the BRIC-countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that look "dispassionately" at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European leadership and the European resources helps through Asia with preventing a long-term breakdown of the global economy.
"We are in the same boat all of them."
"Therefore everyone which can help Europe from this crisis is" helpful, he the Financial Times said in an interview on the fringe of the world economy forum in Mumbai.
"Asia likes to be protected up to a certain degree, but it is not immune."
"If therefore China and India can help, then with all means."
Europe's monetary union got in the last months into a hard fault crisis.
In the last days Italy's interest costs went up dangerously and the prime ministers both of Italy and of Greece resigned.
The arising hard fault crisis in Europe stirs up fears, that the global economy could fall into the recession and added calls, that leading newly industrialized countries would have to put together in order to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag predicted, that every support of Asia is sewered through the IWF, said, however, that mutual agreements - how for example the purchase of Bonds of the EU rescue ground, the Europäische Finanzstabilisierungsfazilität (EFSF) - that greater bargaining power offers to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Secretary of Commerce, said that "India" will do "all which stands in his power" in order to help the euro zone since the own economy suffers now from the sinking exports and the draining of foreign capital flow.
"Nobody wants the euro zone unstably and uproariously to keep on staying", he said.
"We stand before great challenges and we must receive a high growth level."
"It is not an option, it is a task, because where otherwise find we work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue, that developing economies as India did not help the rich Europeans any cause if they themselves stand before great economical challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US American Brown University, said that it would be politically very much heavy to sell to the 1.2 trillion people in India help for Europe of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or still little on day live at the.
"Sometime they will find out that the Greeks with 50 retire and spend vacations at the beach. Then one has a problem", he said.
Lee Howell, administration manager of the world economy forum, asked similarly why India's reserves should be used in order to keep the numerous and well paid employees in Greece in the public service with jobs in bad saw, facilities being losses worth as about of the railroad.
Mr Nag said that the crises will have "significant domino effects" on whole Asia in the euro zone.
The prediction of the ADB with an economic growth around 7.5 percent in Asia for the years of 2011/droht now the risk of the grading due to the threatening danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable threshold markets would have to create "Crisis plans" around itself for a downward trend and to one significant capital migration their Wortschaften protect.
