The secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details about the airplane accident in the case of which the government secretary Francisco Blake and further seven persons died.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y transportation's - SCT (secretary's office for communication and transportation in Mexico) informed of the investigation results referring about the accident in the case of which the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and further seven persons died to the helicopter with his whole intact structure bouncing directly against the ground without the pilot being able to have initiated an emergency landing.
At a press conference Dionisio Pérez Jácome,Sekretär mentioned for communication and transportation that the pilot would have confirmed before the start the climatic conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The facts, that height contact with trees with which the helicopter lost the trunk had the propeller blades in 25 meters, seems to refer to the helicopter having had several contact plates."
It also declared that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, for which it met all assumptions for the transportation of the personnel.
In addition he said that with the investigations on the field on which the machine had come down no helicopter parts were found.
"During the search no airplane parts were thought of other places, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was for 19 occupants built, for which it met all assumptions for the person transportation.
The field shows a Schrägung of 7 to 30 degrees.
At the time of it is major as soon as possibly to get the investigation results, however, can these several months, maybe even a year last.
Gilberto López Meyer for his part assured of, president of Aeropuertos y Servicios auxiliary (secretary's office for airplanes and auxiliary services in Mexico), that the helicopter of the Estado Mayor Presidencial during the impact with travel air speed flown and had fallen the airplane on one soft slope.
"This information strengthens the assumption that it was a question of a normal flight operation at the moment of the strike."
At a press conference the conductor of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, counted six relevant points which should be considered at the investigation:
View flight:
In accordance with the flight norms it was a question of a flight to the rules of the view flight. That means that the team would have to have had sufficient view during the flight and at the ground.
Climatic conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable climatic conditions during the start. During the continuation towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico-state some clouds hanging deep came up.
Chosen air routes:
It is possible that the team had selected a lower field with better view because of the clouds towards the Cuernavaca-valley.
Strike place:
The strike coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter agree. Possibly there were not before the strike either a control loss about the airplane or a deviation from the air route.
Spreading of the remains of the airplane in a restricted field:
The information present up to the present time indicate that the helicopter had hit from straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered airplane residues make presume that the helicopter with his intact structure had hit the ground.
No references to fire or explosion:
Offer the remains of the airplane at the accident place do not make either on fire or on explosion conclude.
The last investigation results indicate several contact plates.
With the investigations on site airplane parts were found on a height of 9200 feet above sea-level. The ground is sloping and shows a Schrägung of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably went to break.
Some information indicate that the helicopter could have had several contact plates.
After a minute search on a field that exceeded the field shut off at the accident place no scattered airplane parts could be found, intensified something the assumption that the intact airplane structure had bounced against the ground.
