The threat is tangible
After the exposure of the "Zwickauer Zelle" Turkish media doubt about the German constitutional state.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" which now again revives.
The murders of eight Turkish-stocky ones and a Greek small entrepreneur in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-extremist background.
This information is reacted to in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany with fear and worry.
Because for many Deutsch-türken a ghost for a long time in a dead way believed returns in this way: Since the fire assaults in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 there has not been any comparable violence with right-extremist background anymore against Turks.
That there is foreigner hostility in Germany was never into consideration in spite of that.
The uncovered right-extremist network reveals, however, extent whose dimension for a long time yet is not forseeable.
"The bloody ideology revives again?" titelte the internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand it stresses that a V man of the intelligence service is supposed to have been to one of the culprits, and it is proved worriedly that also German authorities into the right-radical swamp could be complex.
Prudently the Turkish Germany Municipality reacted: It reminded at the weekend with a reminder guard before the from Brandenburg gate onto the victims of racist power.
Only two weeks before the Turkish municipality had thought in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremonial act of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruiting-agreement.
In cheerful colors was the With each other produced - as a history of the success.
As a slap the reporting of some Turkish media works there: "Germany's present to the Fiftieth" says the heading of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Oat X" that reports the backgrounds of the murder series.
Also the Germany edition of the "Hürriyet" can not be taken it, to draw this intellectual connection.
"It starts stinking", the title of the column of Ahmet Külahci is called.
It stresses in that that people were murdered, would have paid the taxes and would have achieved an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critically the procedure of the police and their late search success is discussed in German-Turkish internet forums.
The German authorities did already rather not remember why to search for suspects in right-extremist circles the authors are surprised.
Many show themselves at least rhetorically readily for drastic means: If people "keep on working sloppily here, nothing else remains for the migrants so than the self-defense and the armament".
"That will be presumably the best selfprotection".
"From the kindness of the clarification and appropriateness of the penalization of the entire network the internal peace hangs very strongly in Germany off", writes "Selen".
The assaults of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties clarified what means it if the internal peace is in danger in Germany.
The photo of the fire ruin of Solingen is deeply anchored in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat more clearly and the German, that distrust and distance can lead to right power.
The assaults sharpened, however, the Wir feeling's on Turkish page.
Do not repeat the errors of the past
In the Turkish press particularly the failure of the German politics was criticized then after the assaults: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire assault of Solingen he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish President of the State, made on the grief celebration in Cologne, however, from his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel represent - Kinkel counted then in his speech as the local Turks achieved many deliveries.
Completely so, as if the value of a human being is charged to the height of his tax deliveries.
The present reporting of the Turkish media shows again once how the distrust of many German Turks is deeply into the local rule of law since then.
Next to the efforts of an extensive clarification and re-evaluation of the right-extreme terrorism in Germany it needs this time open words.
