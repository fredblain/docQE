Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is reworked after danger through delayed US permission
Few days after the Obama government tended to delay the permission of a planned oil pipeline of Canada into the gulf of Mexico with which one annoyed the trade unions and calmed environmentalists simultaneously the enterprise building the pipeline is called in for planning the project again so that one can return again for the normality.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that one will redirect the planned pipeline to the Sandhills from the ecologically sensitive field in Nebraska.
The enterprise canceled the decision on a press conference in the Parliament Building from Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said that the enterprise that finally the pipeline is approved keeps on being confident when also with another course.
It resulted in that after an announcement of the Department of State in the last week, after which one would adjourn one a decision concerning one federal admission for the project, until the new possible course that avoids the field of the Sandhills into Nebraska as well as the Ogallala-Aquifer, a big underwater supply, is checked.
"This is a real step ahead", the republican said opposite lee Terry, a republican from Nebraska, fox terrier news.
The new environmental inspection that the Department of State ordered likes to adjourn a decision to 2013, after the choices in the coming year, even if officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Last week declared to Obama in a written declaration, that the decision is a task of the Department of State and said his support to.
The 1700-mile pipeline united Canada with the golf of Mexico.
They would pump 700,000 barrel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To that the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate it, but they love labor markets, because they reckon that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
Nevertheless the legislators of Nebraska that are against the plan consider the laws in order to force a turning away of the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study for the influence on the environment of the Department of State found out that the project would have only little influence on the environment, but says the sources of the power industry that the main tester of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the inspection procedure, that concentrated on two questions.
One is, whether a lobbyist that was employed by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, that 2008 consultants of Hillary Clinton was, in an interest conflict is.
The other one is whether an enterprise which was charged to carry out the initial study was an inappropriate choice since it is connected to TransCanada.
