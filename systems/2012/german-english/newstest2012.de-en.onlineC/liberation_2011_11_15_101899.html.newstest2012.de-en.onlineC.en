Is immigration load or chance for the economy?
The immigration politics led under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many kinds of angles - overloading of police, court and administration organs due to a politics subjected to the numbers, compatibility of this politics with the status of a "country of the human rights", as France itself had called itself.
Recently the molestation of official page directed towards foreign students had shaped the newsreels, the Minister of the Interior usually had (see Libération of the 23rd May) announces that Frankreich"keine has talents, bricklayers or waiters from the exterior necessarily".
But this politics was analyzed only rarely from the economic point of view.
A comprehensive consensus dominates this topic indeed between rights and left wingers.
From right page the clay was changed by Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976, dass"900.000 unemployed persons, under that" more than 2 million immigrated workers ", no problem for a country might represent", not "pick up" from left page through Michel Rocard, who had explained in 1990, Frankreich"könne the entire poverty of the world.
Only difference consists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit
The fear of the invasion of the national ground through hordes of Polish plumbers was divided into the year 2005 both of the right and of the left.
From both warehouses the immigrants were perceived as a load for the economy and the French society.
The only difference consists in the degree of the Groβzügigkeit, that one is opposite the immigrants admit willing.
Francois Hollande restricts himself in his program on banalities that refer to that cooperative development allows it unsere"Migrationsprobleme" solve.
This idea of immigration as a load, as a problem, can affect the choices possibly; however, it is economically expensive.
How us the economic experts Ian Goldin and vergegenwärtigen to Geoffrey Cameron in a recently appeared work, which summarizes the newest findings concerning the immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our future tenses, May 2011, of Princeton University Press, 352 S.), a wide consensus exists among the specialists with regard to the positive influence of the immigrant flood onto economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting the immigration would invalidate the growth and damage the labor market situation.
The native workers base the apprehensions opposite the influence of the migrants on the idea that these threaten, in particular that one small qualified to substitute when they exerted pressure on their wages.
The experience shows, however, that the immigrants in truth are considerably more complementary than as the native wage workers since they schwerpunktmäβig carry out professions in sectors that are unausgelastet job-technically.
The immigrants in a small way qualified work in sectors which annoy native wage workers little, the more qualified ones among the immigrants work in dynamic sectors in which the training is not adjusted to the work offer.
Positive wage effect
In the same way as a surgeon would have difficulties, to work in a country in which there is a lack of anesthetists so this Komplementarität causes a positive effect of the Einwandererzuzugs onto wages and internal labor market situation also between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri calculated in this way, that a 1%-iger causes rise of the immigrant flood an included, long-term rise of the real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And these without consideration of the fact, that the variety brought in by the immigrants is the idea creation as well as the economic growth zuträglich (high part of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were based by immigrants).
The migrants contribute also net to the employee benefit systems, in the European countries on average about in a height of 1% of the general budget.
The world work organization estimates for example, that a person immigrating from 30 years in the age to Germany brings in the public budget on average about his lifetime a net contribution (Gains minus editions) of around the 150,000 euros.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted the missing Schnittpunkte"mit to starting of his mandate the teeth" cause.
These said teeth which should deter the immigrants achieved, however, the contrary effect exactly.
