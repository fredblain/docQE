Mission ends, congress ready, with regard to Libya communicate
Finally it looks as if republicans and democrats were already in Washington to agree upon Libya with regard to the revolts.
All which was necessary for that was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of the long-standing dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the termination of the American interference.
On Thursday the committee decides for international relationships of the senate on a resolution which subordinates to the chairperson John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut, near which one praises Libya for the successful rebellion and the US American troops for their "courage").
"This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who began with the reconstruction of their country", said Kerry.
"It is a confirmation of the support of their democratic efforts through two parties."
The language likes to ring innocently, however, up to now nothing was simple in the Libya-debate.
This summer legislator of both parties and the White House argued about the word choice of a series of resolutions to the approval or disapproval of the role of the US military in the Libya-mission of the NATO.
In June Kerry and McCain presented a resolution which approved the restricted use of military strengths of the USA in Libya.
The law was rejected in the senate by a wide fringe group of both parties and it did not result in any vote.
However, on the same day this law failed in the senate. In addition the chamber outvoted a decision for the shortening of the money for American operations in Libya.
Through that the US mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a congress, that indeed angry enough was to criticize Obamas, however, approach within the framework of the mission not furious enough, in order finally to pull him away the ground among the feet.
Then the indecision of the congress of the events was overtaken.
Tripoli fell in August under the Libyan rebel and Gaddafi was killed on 20th October.
The NATO-mission ended officially on 31st October.
Maybe now the senate is ready for the action.
The resolution of the committee for international relationships "congratulates the people of Libya on their enormous courage and their extraordinary persistence in their selfliberation" and praises the men and women of the US American military and their coalition partners that support the military operations to the protection of the people in Libya for their extraordinary courage and their professionalism."
The resolution in addition confirms "the national interests of the United States at a successful and irrevocable crossing of Libya for the democracy".
The new measures will receive the full support through the committee for foreign relationships or will they divide up the legislators as it did the law of June?
The last composure bumps onto the resistance of the senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top republican of the committee.
Lugars speaker said on Monday that he did not see the final composure of the new law up to now yet.
According to Kapitol it suits at the senate to vote on a constitutional change that requires a harmonious budget this week a top priority in almost every congress legislative period of the republicans and some democrats.
The measures under the management of the republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional change of the budget or another field to be voted at this time in the senate or congress.
Other legislators attempted up to now unsuccessfully to bring their changes to the vote in spite of their often enough attempting it.
Goodlattes change is only one of 68 constitutional changes which were presented to this congress and contain a whole bandwidth of topics.
Some are double - the same law was presented to both the congress and the senate - others deviate only easily from each other.
It further dozen gives at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change and one only in the senate, that Federal editions would control.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give the possibility in this way to boast to their customers - in particular beginner with the republicans that want to polish up their course of life -, that they "wrote" such a measure.
The budgetary control law that was passed in August requires, that both senate and congress vote on a change of the budget compensation.
In March 58 senators voted for a resolution not binding which supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget some members want to restrict the number of the regulations which members of the congress can present while the republican Jos√© E. Serrano (New York) is wanting to cancel the limitation on two terms of office of the president.
The republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) suggested a series of changes that guarantees the right to a good education and health care among other things.
A change that forbids a marriage among homosexual is just the same as a change that prohibits from the burning of flags, a presentation always turning round again.
Some legislators in addition want to facilitate the cancellation of federal laws if two thirds of the states refuse these.
Travel so eagerly as the members suggest to changes so much more quickly they as in the last years.
In the 111th congress legislators presented 77 of such changes. in the 110th congress 66.
The speed fades in comparison with that of the early 1990th years in which members suggested every two years to regularly more than 150 changes so the numbers that the senate library provides.
However, they were not either much more successful than the present ones were.
The last change that is to be added - the 27th -, was ratified in 1992, was suggested, however, to the congress in in fact already 1789.
