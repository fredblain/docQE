The menu of a fat-addicted child: Does not frühstückt and eats sausage to the dinner
More than one third of the children of 9 to 13 have problems with predominance at what 9 percent of all pupils and 5 percent of all children are overweight.
Current proven inquiries - adipöse children come mostly from families with unhealthy life-style.
So it is proved again once how the environment in which he grows up and which examples which surround it are is importantly for the healthy development of a human being.
On the tables of adipöser children sausages stand up to half more frequently on the table, than in families in which standard measure important children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had on day before of the clarification action under the motto "Adipositas" Chip to the dinner "is not any coincidence".
In families with fatties also sport does not number just among the favorite employments, what, however, also the majority affects the present pupils - only 15 percent answered, that their parents wenigsten once in the week of time for active movement find.
Inquiry among 900 children
The inquiry occurred last year by the end of the school year, in this case almost 900 children were consulted from elementary schools in whole Czechia.
That was already the second age-group of the action "Adipositas is not any coincidence", that is supported by the general health insurance and the society Unilever.
Up to now more than 12 thousand pupils participated in the project from 4th and 8th classes.
Unhealthy food and missing movement in the family are in this case decisive factors, that for those ones frightening increasing number of children with predominance or even obesity are responsible.
"Only half of the consulted children mentioned for example, five times on day, to eat in the mode breakfast second breakfast lunch vespers dinner - one of the main assumptions for a healthy feeding, so one of the survey results says".
No breakfast and sausage to the dinner
Experts refer, that also relative trifles, as for example also the regular breakfast time of the family, important for the healthy development of a child are.
In Czechia only 23 percent of the families of the pupils frühstücken, however.
And - in most families every alone for themselves frühstückt.
The determination was worst, which is not gefrühstückt in every tenth family at all.
The breakfast is regarded in this case as a foundation stone of the healthy daily feeding.
The inquiry test brought among other things on the day, that one consumes much more often unhealthy chips in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - without regard for the weight - drinks every day of sweet lemonades (70 percent)
Indeed more than 40 percent of the consulted children do sport, do only less, however, than half of their parents that - indeed only 15 percent.
Put yourself together your own menu
A further part of the inquiry made to compile oneself their own food plan from offered possibilities according to appetite and opinion for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) possible.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 as regards prefer to feeding is far away of the ideal of a healthy feeding.
There were a lot of farinaceous food, meat dishes and of course sweets among their favorite dish.
"Alarming particularly the great popularity of sweet lemonades" is", is stressed in the final report for this inquiry.
During the lunch, that is the main course, pastas triumphed just before poultry.
The children did not like case fruits almost at all and also the popularity of fish and vegetable courts as lunches was very small.
Hinkehr for the health
Simultaneously the inquiry also showed, however, that the children are absolutely ready to change their eating habits if they get correct information.
"With the control group of the inquiry participants, that the questionnaire" on completion of the informative lecture "Adipositas no coincidence is" filled, a clear shift of the preferences was "to be noted" in many cases there to basic principles of the healthy feeding", is in the results of the project led.
This was obvious for example near the sweet lemonades, where many children began, usual water to give the priority.
The children also much more often ticked off poultry or fish as a main course of the day in the questionnaire and were ready to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
