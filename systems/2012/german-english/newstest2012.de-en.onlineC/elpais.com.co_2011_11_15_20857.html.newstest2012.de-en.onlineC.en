The "indignant" ones provoke the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into tents on the Zuccotti-place.
A majority complied with the clearing command and changed his location into a park seemed likely.
The members of the movement Ocupy Wall Street provoked the authorities of New York on this Tuesday, when they attempted once again with a judicial order to enter the Manhatten-place after they had been evacuated from the place in the dawn and had attempted to fill another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded before the Zuccotti-place onto which they wanted to provide with admission with a judicial order that allowed the "Indignant" one the renewed camping at this place. Meanwhile another part of the movement stuck to the clearing command and kept on filling a park to the north in the city, where it resulted in nine arrests.
"Our idea is, that, if the court does not allow us to camp on the place we us at another place find and continue the battle with legal means around the return to the Zuccotti, with sit-in the and peaceful demonstrations, mark told to Bray, one of the speakers of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray exported that the answer "Outraged" to that one onto the clearing of their tent warehouse that directly of Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York had been ordered an, until before court, where the judge Lucy Billings distributed an order that forbade the violent clearing of the place and allowed the demonstrators the camping, came.
In addition the "Indignant" ones filled a new park that is completely found at the crossing of the centrally sited Canal Street and the Sixth Avenue near the entrance into the Holland-tunnel that unites New York and New Jersey and property is the Trinity Church.
You could fill the place for at least an hour. But after that the police arrived and some of the demonstrators arrested although Bray can not give any exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he saw also several journalists with handcuffs under that.
The organization assures hundreds of people would have arrived at this place at which also a delegation of religious leaders as signs of their support of the members of the movement and to the mediation with the police had arrived.
Meanwhile the Zuccotti-place (a ground in private property) stays closedly in expectation of a judicial hearing that is still scheduled for this Tuesday, and in the case of which the legality of the clearing occurred in the dawn is supposed to be analyzed.
Some of the demonstrators driven from the place bore photoprints of this judicial order with themselves and distributed it. You gave it even to some policemen that guarded the place, which resulted "some small collisions" in the consequence, as Bray that had indicated told some policemen would have beaten demonstrators.
The judicial instruction forbids to the authorities, to clear members from Occupy Wall Street from the place as well as the application of "Laws, who were adopted after the occupation and to forbid that the demonstrators with their tents and other things that they had used already before return to the park."
Mayor Bloomberg, who due to this judicial order the renewed opening of the place was canceled for the public traffic and the demonstrators, explains before the press. It pointed out to the demonstrators the city laws not allowing them to settle once again with tents and sleeping bags at this place.
The mayor defended personally the clearing of the Zuccotti-place carried out in the dawn in the case of which almost 200 persons were arrested, and which was concluded because the demonstrators "offended against the right."
Bloomberg declared it would have given the order for the clearing of the place because this itself "into a place had changed, onto which the people did not come for the demonstrating, but for the breaking of the laws and in some cases, in order to cause other persons damage", because "threats would have received some businesses" and the residents feared "for their living quality".
"The clearing in the dawn was disgusting and shows, that Bloomberg is interested in the reason at the protection of the finance interests and not at the protection of the interests of the North American workers", the speaker of the movement added, "not to respect the freedom of the press" that accused the mayor.
The persons responsible of "Occupy Wall Street" informed of their thinking about organizing "great actions" for the Thursday and indeed together with municipality organizations and trade unions, to commemorate around the two months that the protests now already regret since the 17th September.
