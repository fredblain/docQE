The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, meets tomorrow the president of Italy in order to introduce the new government which is supposed to offer the forehead to the crisis which led Italy onto the edge of the economic breakdown to this.
A communication from the premiership palace announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would meet the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday in order to confirm the government education.
Goes out from that that he will introduce a cabinet mainly put together from technocrats although it is not yet clear when the new Prime Minister will take up his office.
Monti said he would present the results of the conversations with the political parties for the government education to the President of the State.
"I would like to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to become ready with these difficult times", said the former EU superintendent to the journalists.
Monti did not confirm the government education expressly, but it follows from his comments that the obstacles are overcome.
The "frame is now well marked out", he added.
Monti got it into less as three days, to form a government, that is much less time than in a normal way. Meanwhile Italy fights against a political and financial crisis which drove the costs into an intolerable height for the debts.
The government new, led by the former EU superintendent Monti must say goodbye a hard saving-parcel that was demanded by the euro politicians in order to retrieve the changed confidence in Italy.
The pressure for the hurry that burdens Monti still intensified through the varying market, due to which the Italian state loans for 10 years with 7 percent of interests were loaded. That corresponds to apply the European rescue screen at the state with which Greece and Ireland saw themselves forced.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria informed the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government according to all strengths."
We believe that this government is the last chance so that Italy comes out of this emergency situation.
The success chances Montis were increased by the support of the party PDL from Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday due to the crisis, considerably.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are certain in order to cause good results", said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the middle-right-party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party of Italy, is essential, because until now many of their members spoke out against a government mainly consisting of technocrats which just forms Monti.
Support of the parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the conversion of the probably unpopular economy measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the putting off of the reforms could cause once again a disastrous attack of the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks exerts also pressure with his tip a failure Montis is a disaster.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and entrepreneur associations as well as with youth and woman organizations.
Tuesday evening is supposed to be closed the meeting round.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano that put an extremely fast government change in motion in response to the crisis.
After short reviving by the end of the last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign due to the insecurity about the success of the new Prime Minister the costs reached again critical borders for the Italian state loans.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt at the level of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the present EU rescue screen.
Monti said his government must last up to the next choices to probably be kept off in the year 2013 in spite of the forecasts that the politicians will give him only time for the conversion of the reforms the choices starts prefer.
Monti expressed, he would receive politicians into his cabinet gladly, but the large parties insist on this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their objections faced with the procedure imposed from the pressure of the financial markets.
Show political sources there, that the mutual distrust and the disagreements between the lots make the inclusion complicated by persons from the political life.
