Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento expects the Rückspiel with groβem optimism against Bosnia (22:00 o'clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
During the first leg both teams had lacked the functionalism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and particularly a happy country".
Paulo Bento already in Poland and Ukraine sees himself.
For it there is not the least flight of doubt that "La Selecçao", his Nationalelf for which it draws since September 2010 responsibly will qualify for the European championship in 2012.
For Portugal that means in fact only 90 minutes of bliss.
But it gives to play a match, and to rid oneself of an opponent, and Bosnia indeed.
In view of the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems manifest that the dies did not fall yet.
Portugal dominated the lot clearly over more than one hour, but the team was not able to leave the so important stamp which would have taken the pressure from it on the thing.
"That is a good result which, however, contains a certain risk since we did not achieve any Auswärtstor".
At home, however, in their Stade de erstrahlenden brightly la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced by that, before a public, that might be just as heiβ onto the game, to come through even if the lot" was "just" announced "to als"sehr of course the optimistic one said, however, clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very brief match, are, however, complete convinced by being able to gain the upperhand the 42-year old Portuguese coach declared".
"We keep on having to be a 50%-ige chance during the European championship 2012 in this case", the successor of Carlos Queiroz relocated, however.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to achieving a fool and winning.
A draw can already suffice for the Bosnians who have also a gate necessarily.
"That is a good result which, however, contains a certain risk since we did not achieve any Auswärtstor", regrets Bento.
"We will compete with a team which has high technical qualities and decrees them about players with many individual qualities" he added.
As already in Zenica the Portuguese would plan to exert already at the beginning maximum pressure on the Bosnians" not "admit" um"ihnen any time for the contemplation".
A good idea, on condition of, that this time it is put into the action.
