Trade union of the attendants will submit complaint against the city because of dismissals
The trade union, the hundreds of school attendants, that last month their job have lost, represents, intends to sue the city on Wednesday since the dismissals are not necessary and discriminating due to their inappropriate influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The complaint is probably the last possibility, that of the trade union, district council 37, in their efforts, to cancel the dismissals, still openly stands.
Have described six hundred and seventy-two school helpers, care coordinators and other employees that belonged to the worst paid employees of the city and had lost their work on the 7th October in a move with whom the budget gap should be filled the union leader than political revenge for one having refused the access to a health ground that the teams maintained in the last year of the city.
Was rejected this accusation categorically from the authorities.
On a hearing of the town council it said to Dennis M. Walcott, director of the schools, in the last month the dismissals were part of the budget that one said goodbye in June.
A member of the town council fired back and declared him that in the budget nothing specifies that employees of the school help would be released.
Officials of the town council 37 said, they would have and they warned the education ministry against a complaint. On Wednesday there will be a press conference on which the submitting of the complaint is announced before the Supreme Court in Manhattan formally.
The complaint becomes Mr. Present Walcott and the education ministry of the city as defendants and count eight released workers as a complainant that all are colored or Latin-American women as most of the helpers that lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Ministry of Justice of the city, said, there would not be the complaint for the city and thus their single claims can not be commented to.
According to a complaint draft which there is for the New York Times the trade union concentrated on the number of the dismissals at the schools in the pauper quarters of the city in order to support a complaint because of different treatment. She says that poor schools would have lost more helpers since they are chronically unterfinanziert.
She explains, that, during it no dismissals on states Iceland and only few dismissals in the schools the upper East Side or TriBeCa was, have lost 17 school helpers in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and were released 46 helpers in the districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight school helpers that were employed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the complaint says: "This is not a neighborhood of well-to-do parents who can organize donations in order to absorb budget shortenings."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was shortened this year around 3.26 percent. In addition money disappeared when the city changed their calculation method for the extrafinancing for every pauper school registration.
The trade union in addition laments that the conductors of the High Schools were guided through the language in a Memo who approved the dismissal of the care coordinators into the insane.
The Memo also used the English word "excess" in order to describe the action when "excess" (German: hand over) in the USA usually the change of a teacher of the payroll of a school into a pool of available workers describes, that are paid from the central department.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were released, not "handed over", says the complaint draft.
