Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, according to an expert committee
The Canadians live in refusal of the death, as follows from a report of the Royal Society of Canada
The committee declared, that governments cooperated, institutions of the health care and doctors with regard to analgesic treatment around the best analgesic means ready to set, and this also about the cancer cases exceeding.
The Canadian society lives in a refusal attitude opposite the death.
Only 9% of the Canadians accept in fact on that to speak with their doctor about conditions among which they would like to die and hit dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report of the Royal Society by Canada, at which six experts were shared, which are associated with each other on different fields, among other things ethic, right and medicine.
This committee recommends the government to change the criminal law in such a way around suicide and euthanasia accompanied allow, where this choice positions itself, and indeed with patients, that than to be looked at in the situation to make such a decision.
As a prelude the experts quote a recently published inquiry of the independent society EIU which had compared the death quality with each other in 40 countries of the globe of the earth.
Although Canada positioned itself at that on the 10th rank, the study notices that "the medical dying-care in Canada produced a culture in which the people are afraid to touch the topic death".
Medical care or not: 77% of the Canadians do not have any access to analgesic means, so the experts sent for from the Royal Society of Canada tell to us.
And in spite of the wish of the Canadians of the majority, to die at home, so die, however, finally 68.6% of these in the hospital.
The rate with 86% is here considered by the entire country at dying-cases kicked in in the hospital in the Quebec most highly.
In the tricky question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide the authors of the report come to conclusions, the the position of the federal government that already geäuβert has of no changes of the criminal law concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide want to carry out, opposite are.
Now, however, there is according to the experts, have inspected the gleichermaβen ones all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and accompanied suicide legalizes or have entkriminalisiert, no evidence, that such decriminalization Miβbräuche in those one application, therefore the practice realization of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or not agreeing persons after themselves would pull.
On the contrary one encounters considerably more case of such infringements just in the countries, in which euthanasia and are legalized accompanied suicide not, as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, cosignatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is unequivocally illegal."
"Also accompanied suicide is practised in Canada, although here unequivocal illegal", Jocelyn Downie declares.
Canadians approve the euthanasia
Let's Vergegenwärtigen ourselves that themselves had according to an Angus-Reid-inquiry carried out in the year 2010 already 85% of the Canadians for the benefit of the euthanasia geäuβert since they think this allows persons at the end of their life to moderate their sufferings.
And believe 66%, that the facts of a legalization of the euthanasia has negotiated not for the consequence the message that the life of older or handicapped people less value besäβe.
With regard to the persons, that have practised already an accompanied suicide, the interviewees to 41% represent the opinion that these should not be pursued legally.
Situation represents itself what affects maintaining or attitude of the means with patients as less clear, according to the authors of the report.
In the same way these advise in their recommendation list that in the criminal law it is supposed to be indicated that the settling of the means for which there was a valid refusal is not supposed to be regarded as criminal.
The expert committee in addition demands that specialists of the health service should be trained in the task of having to fear a settling of the means at the life end to respect, and this without legal pursuit.
The committee declared, that governments cooperated, in order to set the best analgesic means readily, institutions of the health care and doctors with regard to analgesic treatment and this also about the cancer cases exceeding.
Finally the committee demands physical pains with regard to the means already in the Canadian institutions for the health care comprehensively used to pain relief or lebensabschlieβender Maβnahmen to take these into consideration at least since these served little as the euthanasia to that in the same way reduce and these itself onto the same procedures would refer.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts on the right field of the health service expressed already reservations from Canada with regard to the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society.
RA Pierre Deschamps, specialist in the health right, the attitude of the report-signing experts has among other things als"extrem" describes since this of the euthanasia practice sets with sick people in the final phase of any borders.
"This opens the gates for a situation, in which every to whom than 18 years it is world-weary and older to ask another person for being helpful to his suicide to him", so RA Deschamps, that yesterday had checked a summary of the report.
RA Deschamps also stresses, the authors of the report splint to put the direct responsibility of the individual about all other values that are shared to the society in the social knit fabric.
Now however, so he says, would give es"Leitlinien and obligations in a society".
Margaret Somerville, specialist for health right, expressed strong resistance" opposite the conclusions of the report "to ebenfalls"einen", who" called "her als"Pro euthanasia manifesto".
Margaret Somerville, who even member is to the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the report information concerning the nonpresence of abuses in certain countries, in which euthanasia and are legalized accompanied suicide, as for example in the Netherlands and in Oregon.
