No releasing novelette for Tymoshenko through the parliament
The Ukrainian parliament refused the request today, to abolish within the framework of a novelette of the penal code the section on whose basis the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been condemned.
The representatives refused the new regulation which could have smoothed the way for the liberation of the arrested ex prime minister during the second reading of the request for easing of the punishments for economical offenses.
Timoshenko was supposedly in October one thing because of the end disadvantageous contract's with Russia about the purchase of natural gas to seven years of custody condemned.
The judgment is not legal yet, in December the appointment of the convicted persons in court is supposed to be discussed.
Timoshenko himself refers to the judgment as political revenge of the regime and also in the west the process made the suspicion of the prejudice of the court arise.
To remove the request, section 365 on whose basis the ex prime minister was condemned from the penal code was supported from 147 representatives.
226 voices would have been necessary to his assumption.
