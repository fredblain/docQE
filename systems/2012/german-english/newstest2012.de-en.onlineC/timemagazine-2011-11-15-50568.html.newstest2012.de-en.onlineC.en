7 lessons of the interview with the late Steve jobs, that was shown this week in a theater
After the death of Steve jobs on 5th October compared unites it with Henry Ford and presented in this case the technique genius as a tall modern inventor.
What Apple fans, however, think maybe most informatively in the recently again discovered job interview which one in this week in front of special screenings on the important markets was dusted is how very much this creative head understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self appointed hippie, however he was also a meticulous organizer that tinkered eagerly with diagrams - a man that believed that many managers suffer from "an illness of the thinking that a really splendid idea forms 90 percent of the work... [however] it enormous amount gives one at craft art between a splendid idea and a splendid product."
In 1995 bobsled Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the compartment idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he more long than an hour with jobs together sat in which they led one of the rare, detailed conversations.
To this time were than 10 years last, since then jobs from Apple had been close. And he worked in an already hard way on his new computer enterprise NeXT, and looked forward to the wide assumption of the internet.
While a small part was being used interview by Cringleys in compartment idiots, he says that the masters of the interview were missing during the delivery.
First after jobs death discovered one a complete VHS copy in the garage of the director.
"Steve" forms this slightly reworked film material the basis for the 68-minute film "jobs: The lost interview", that this Wednesday and Thursday into the country marrow theaters comes.
For somebody that is known to that that it detests detailed interviews, appears to jobs here surprisingly eagerly in the explanation of his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview it comes four times to longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of pondering, in which jobs considers unequivocal his thoughts and called in for accuracy is.
There are also moments, in which jobs 'Perfectionism to light comes to come in more quickly on topics or secondary actions of greater importance if apparently it reacts to Cringelys questions impatiently and anschubst it.
The Lost Interview appears received by Pixar, iPod or iPhone before the era somehow sinisterly farsightedly if jobs evaluates what other enterprises of his opinion correctly or wrongly do and his own vision to the future of the computer represents.
It is a thing, posthumous assessments of the career jobs 'read. To see jobs here, however, as the desirous dreamer who is on the jump for the magnificence is a little very different, ingenious and inspiring.
He has a vision as the things could be and should be.
In a word after his having explained this here everything, he set out and it did.
A fast look onto seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
He learned how to lead an enterprise:
"During the whole years in the business I always ask: "Why you do things"?. And the answer that you always get is: "Oh, it is simply made like this."
Nobody knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business really thinks coming in above things after.
I arrested that.
Jobs exports his efforts wider, to rationalize the bookkeeping at Apple.
Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly one began with "Standard costs" that were numbered onto bare supposition there and that then were adapted with "deviation" - it developed an automatized factory that guaranteed that the business costs could be determined to the smallest.
How the Pope became veralbert:
Jobs tells about the "Blue Box" that he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which one could creep into the telephone society and lead long-distance calls for nothing.
Already a lot was written about the device, however jobs enthusiasm, when he describes the Blue Box as an act of the Selbstbem√§chtigung, is passing on.
He describes how Wozniak and it would test the box, make a call when they use a chargeable telephone, and unite themselves then from a AT&T-network into another while they are abrading as many satellites as possibly.
"We sent things half a dozen once around the globe and if one bawled into the telephone, it came a minute again out later in the telephone next door", tells to jobs gigglingly.
"We were young and we learned that we can establish even something that can control trillions of dollar at infrastructure on the whole world."
We both, we did not know much, but we could build this small thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that there would be Apple without them.
Jobs keeps on telling of one glorious prank, that Wozniak and it has removed almost, than they called right in the night via Blue Box in the Vatican and with the Pope wanted to speak, during it so good they could imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called right in the night in order to speak with the American diplomat, the two of them had to laugh away before the Pope came even onto the telephone.
How he fell with the technique in love (and Bill Hewlett in an unprepared way called):
In the age of 12 years, when he searched for spare parts in order to build a frequency counter he searched for Bill Hewlett in the telephone directory and called him.
Shortly to their 20-minute telephone call kept for jobs for the summer a partial time job with Hewlett-Packard.
"That had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only enterprise, that I had seen in the age and that shaped it my opinions about what an enterprise was and how it treated his employees well."
Jobs of one of the HP employees that went to the research laboratories of the enterprise in Palo Alto became later where it "the first desktop computer, which ever was manufactured" saw.
It was as large as a suitcase was, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I fell with it in love.
I would climb at HP as teenagers up and love this machine and write programs for them.
How one corrects innovations:
Repeatedly in the interview jobs above how one invents spontaneously new products speaks.
Already early in his career when he installed some boards he was asked for putting together the whole computer by a customer.
It worked with a term of payment only of 30 days and had to think over both the assembling and the delivery of the ready devices.
He remembers late ones at Apple onto the problems which he had during the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember sweeping arguments... they schrien me at, that it would last five years [in order to build a mouse that would cost $ in 300] and I got up, went from that and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later we had a mouse, which we could make for $ 15 build. That was incredibly credible.
About great enterprises which decrease:
Longest before he made Apple revive again, jobs saw the ways on which so many industry giants with their visions got into stumbling and lost the control of their stocks.
"We say you work near IBM or Xerox therefore you make a better copier or printer, na and?"
You have the stock monopoly, therefore the enterprise is not more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, therefore [it is such people], which finally lead the enterprises and the product, with which the people are pushed from the decision-making.
The product genius that led this monopoly too becomes from the people, which do not have any draft concerning good products vs. bad products, eradicated - craft art necessary.
The strained one at Xerox...
Xerox could have had the whole computer industry.
One could have been ten times taller, the Microsoft of the 1990th years could have been...
You caught the defeat of the victory.
About innovation as an art form:
Every amount craft art lies between a splendid idea and a splendid product... if one develops this splendid idea, it changes and increases."
One learns a lot about his fineness.
One must carry out votes, certain things, that one not can, however electrons, glass, robots, factories.
One must remember 5000 things, bring together these drafts, and them all...
Finally it comes to the taste, it comes to that, that one attempts deals with the best stuff that people created and attempts then to bring together these things to what one does.
Picasso said that good artists copy, splendid artists steal.
We are always shameless in the stealing of splendid ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh splendid was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, were historians who are the best computer scientists of the world by chance.
If it had not been the computer branch, they would create fantastic things in other fields.
