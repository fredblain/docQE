Military is confronted with the wachsenden pressure for the hard punchthrough at rape
In this week an important hearing decides on whether 28 women and men are accused of nonintervention at a rape in front of the military court.
If it should not result in that, hundreds of complainants stand ready for the next hearing.
Lance corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when it was oppressed at night by a soldier colleague.
It was in October 2008 and it returned just to their barracks from San Diego of the supper with a friend that bore a 12th pack beer with himself in Miramar to the north when it stumbled on a masculine colleague.
He asked her whether he might accompany it on a drink into their room.
"My alarm bells started" Lyman said.
But Texan wiped their objections aside.
I thought: "Ach what, he is 19.
He is from Texas", she said.
"I wanted, I would have listened to my stomach feeling."
Few minutes, after they had gone in Lymans rooms, the man stepped behind them, it pressed down and she violated, she claims.
This week, on 18th November, Lyman and 27 other present and former military employees wait anxiously for a process with a historical hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a complaint is approved which they raised against the former defense minister Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, in court.
The complaint claims, that to Gates and Rumsfeld did not rake against the widespread rape within the military and under injury of the constitutional ones the soldiers' have gone on.
In February of Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C. submitted, the complaint grasped at the beginning of 17 complainants that, however, went up onto 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men that say that they were oppressed by soldier colleagues or misused sexually all and that the military failed to condemn to investigate or one appropriate according to jurisdiction the supposed attacks availably put.,
Burke says she hunts the uppermost military leadership since the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically built up", she says.
"Who the single persons that are in the position are to exterminate the culture retaliation that one too? The leadership."
Burke in addition says that she has contacted almost 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future complaints.
Your strategy: Instead of all complainants putting so to speak their eggs into a basket, they submit many more complaints if necessary in order to receive the pressure uprightly.
The team of the defense for the Ministry of Defense, led by Federal state attorney Neil MacBride, made a request in order to reject complaint.
The files of the court that there are for Newsweek would bring on fully the defense strategy, in the first place, that the military can not be accused by present or former soldiers for injuries to whom it came in the armed forces.
Due to a law of the Supreme Court from the year 1950, the so-called Feres-doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries which are added to themselves in the active service of contained soldier.
"The probable damages arose during the military service of the complainants", says the document.
The Ministry of Defense refuses every comment on this history.
The things have changed themselves since the 1950th years.
If women are not yet authorized for the service in the fight, the distinction is only like this in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and in Afghanistan teams of soldiers play increasingly important roles, especially in the contact tie with native women in the war fields.
The result: between these two wars 150 soldiers, two thirds of them in clashes, died.
It is at the time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And it does not stand in their fight only there: three more complaints except for theirs are pendant.
At the Yale Law School the Veterans prepares 'Legal Services Clinic a complaint against the four most important military academies because of probable promotion of an anti-women atmosphere in front of.
Independently of that compiles the non-profit Vietnam Veterans of America a complaint against the military before, in which one concentrates on the diagnosis "Personality trouble" that rape victims received in order to release her from the service - a usual approach according to activists as Anu Bhagwati of the service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Your group gave in December complaint against the Veterans administration (German: Administration of the war veterans) one, in which she reproached her for discriminating practices in their contact with achievement claims for persons that indicated to have been misused in the service sexually.
Nine laws was presented independent of each other through a mixture of senators and representatives of both parties that a series of clues offer the congress.
Responses Office became 2010 according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and (German: Office for prevention and announcement of sexual abuse) the Ministry of Defense's 3,158 sexual abuses indicated.
Most of nevertheless the abuses are not announced at all and after the own estimate of the pentagon this number considers approx. 13.5 percent of the appreciated ones 19,000 cases to which it per annum comes.
The report which was published in March examines also the prosecution rates: In 2010 20 percent of the understood cases in the military in court, only half as many as in the civil law, came.
Describe the complainants in Burkes case their attacks only as the first of a series of traumas.
In Lymans case she announced the probable rape of the military police less than one hour after the assault.
In this night, so she says, she was asked 11 times for telling the details of their rape a whole row from policemen, doctors and commanders.
It had a rape set and the blood of their assailant which came from a cut at his arm was found in their bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listened to by a judge. During this hearing she was asked for the sex which she had before the infringement with their friend.
Six persons testified as character witnesses on behalf of the supposed culprit who finally was absolved.
"I remember still well the day, when the judgment was read out", says Lyman.
"I thought the drifts would start. I ran shouting from the courtroom."
"You brought me into the psychiatric department and I remember, that I came out, than I again, to my commander said: That was not his procedure. That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to consult a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed a personality trouble and declared it as unfit for service.
From January 2010 she was released dishonorably so that she does not receive any support.
Whether the complaint which Lyman and the other complainants submitted gets on is pure speculation, says John Turley, professor of the jurisprudence, at the George Washington University Law School.
In spite of that, so he says: "According to my opinion they should get on."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine which is criticized since it was questioned for the first time.
I am during one's lifetime a critic of the Feres-doctrine.
The military is wrong a decade afterwards, because they do not have the same stimulus and the same deterrent that brings a liability with themselves.
He adds: "The chances stand against them... however it is important for them that they attempt it."
These things will change themselves only then, if good people are ready fight.
If the hearing does not follow their way, Burke, the lawyer of the complainants, will begin with their hundreds of other complainants for future cases.
"We will keep on fighting the military in this respect until it results in reforms", she says.
Or until we die, whatever when first kicks in.
