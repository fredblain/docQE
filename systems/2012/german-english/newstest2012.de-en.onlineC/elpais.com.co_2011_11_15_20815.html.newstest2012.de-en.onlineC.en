The work of the doctor who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano was like this
A Lophoskopist from Cali came in as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano" into the history.
The work of these officials plays a decisive role.
On the last 4th one November a Lophoskopist went of the investigation unit of the prosecution (CTI) from Cali as the man, that the identity of the chief of the FARC confirmed (Fuerzas armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - revolutionaries armed forces of Colombia), one: "Alfonso Cano" through comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of the CTI, this week Eliazar González Bereitschaftsdienst had, a man from Puerto Tejada that for 21 years with legal preliminary inquiries cooperates.
At the beginning of his career González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he had to go into the jungle frequently for five days in order to reach the place at which the corpses who it should identify were found.
In 2000 he siedelte ueber according to Valle and after the completion of the necessary courses it specialized on Lophoskopie, that is the investigation of the skin that is stopped frictions, that is the manual and feet faces.
In the week of the use against the so genannten Alfonso Cano it was pointed out to Eliazar to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something large expected it.
Friday night he flew in the helicopter from Palmira according to Cauca.
He knew that it should identify two corpses, and that the suspicion that one can be that of the man that that one had routed oldest Guerrilla of the world existed. Therefore he should take along the ten finger print leaf from Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name).
When it, however, reached with the Untersuchungste the place at which the corpse was found, it could not identify it due to his physical appearance, because this did in the least not resemble the figures which he had seen in the mass mediums.
He did not have any beard, was dressed as a farmer of the area, did not wear any glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifier, ink, a planting-ladle and a flashlight Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those ones on the print leaf.
He had seen correctly: It was "Alfonso Cano".
This man coming from Puerto Tejada was the still same night responsibly for that to the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to inform that it was a question of the head of the FARC in fact.
On tracing
For a Daktyloskopen of the Sijín in Cali the assessment which the president Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González made on a press conference about the use against "Cano" become zuteil was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate which can be a key factor during the solution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten do not identify only corpses, they support also investigations in murder and robbery things and they confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
During their arrest many delinquents present wrong identity papers or they do not have any.
We take away the fingerprints from them and search these in the database.
The researcher told to us that it had to tear a piece of wall from a house with a theft, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this place with his hand when it pulled out a safe crammed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for the decrease of fingerprints. However, in this case we could take the print from the whole hand and identify the delinquent that had participated in several thefts", he remembered.
With the aid of the fingerprints also murder suspects can be unburdened or burdened.
Recently a dead man was found surrounded from liquor bottles.
During the determination it was presumed that a dependant could be suspect, and in fact a fingerprint agreed on the bottle.
Although that does not guarantee that it is a question of the murderer, nevertheless so it is related with the place at which the crime was inspected.
A Daktyloskopist of the CTI declared that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical Reagenzen would be taken of the object."
If they appear, she becomes a planting-ladle or she uses a band to the cash and carry.
After that the prints are sent to the Asif, that is the criminal database, or onto the civil status office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers", declared the expert of the CTI.
He thought, not everything is the way it would be represented in the TV series SCI.
So as all gold is not what shines all which one tackles is not either a fingerprint.
But in spite of that it can be used if one carries out a corresponding comparison.
