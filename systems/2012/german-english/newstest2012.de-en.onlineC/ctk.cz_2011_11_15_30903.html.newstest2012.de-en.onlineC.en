The general meeting is supposed to find a new chairperson - again a stalemate threatens.
For already almost five months the Czech soccer has no chairperson and it threatens in this case that the successor will be not confessed from Ivan Hasek at the top of the Czech soccer association (FAČR) even after the exceptional general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until today there is not indeed yet any agreement according to which election regulation people are supposed to choose.
And without these at all no vote is possible about the three potential successors.
Three prospective customers would like to manage the Czech soccer - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclík.
In June Hasek resigned from his function, at which he had asked his colleagues with the resignation to that to agree and to find a strong personality that can lead the soccer in future.
Only - in the era according to Hasek the old squabbles between the two association chambers that can not agree on a common candidate broke out once again.
This was proved klipp and clearly on 16th September, when the new chairperson should be selected.
The delegatees of the general meeting had come very for nothing into the nation house in the Prager quarter of Smíchov, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not a question only of the choice in this case self.
One could not agree indeed once on who is actually voice-entitled during the full collection - only the statutes-moderate representatives or also the officials endowed with a proxy.
In this only point one achieved at least partial agreement which also the recommendation of the institute for state and right in whose opinion a representation is not admissible on proxy basis contributed to.
The quarrels around the election regulation keep on lasting, however.
Also the executive committee did not bring more clearness into the thing, at whose meetings - regardless, whether tidy or exceptional - basically nothing at all other more on the agenda stands.
Even if the opinions were changed with respect to the choice of a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same one.
The question says: how is one supposed to proceed in the 3rd round in order to avoid a stalemate-situation?
"The quarrel point affects the question whether one is supposed to proceed in agreement with the statutes, or whether a very different model must be found" Dusan Svoboda set, one of the three deputy chairpersons of the FAČR firm, that represents the pro soccer in the management.
According to statutes-moderate model the candidate who receives the bigger prozentuelle support in the chamber for which he presents himself triumphs in the third round.
Moravia is supposedly readily to pay attention to the compromise that the candidate triumphs who receives the higher voice number from both chambers.
The Czech page in turn exists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two third majority with this prozentuellen voice counting.
"Then the two qualifying round does not have at all any sense anymore this mode would "question" the entire two chamber draft, the election regulation does not understand Svoboda the objections of the mährischen page that would find it best bend, but to choose according to valid statutes.
Also Tomás Paclík agrees to that surprisingly even if it emerges that the statutes-moderate election regulation presumably comes of all candidates at the ehesten towards Pelta.
"It is my wish that according to the statutes people largely choose."
"In this way no senseless replacement variants are thought out, as during the last general meeting", the owner (the soccer club) declared Victoria to Plzeň that presents himself for the first time and distanced himself in his comments opposite particularly Pelta.
Pelta remains, however, optimistic.
In his opinion the new chairperson will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate also constructively.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the Fußball-EM on the present day would surely contribute to smoothing of the feelings."
"If the soccer rides first on the euphoric wave, also the willingness to the cooperation is greater then", thinks the official from Jablonec, who brings the greatest experiences from all three adepts and this both on professional, as also regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved there.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately conflicting."
"That is not a thing between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts "to bend" the rules to own purposes."
"Therefore a renewed blocking is not impossible during the general meeting."
"I hope, however, for finally the healthy human intellect triumphing", said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time for the understanding of all pages does not remain more.
Some negotiations should happen supposedly directly in Montenegro, however who knows whether the Fußballgeneralität will be anyway complete up to the qualification game.
The charter flight stuff with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl according to Podgorice should fly among other things could not set off at the morning into Prague because of a technical trouble at all and so one sought feverishly according to a replacement variant how one to bring a part of the executive committee nevertheless still onto the venue of the bar rage first leg.
Finally nevertheless presumably the meeting to which it is supposedly supposed to come on Wednesday is then decisive on minister level.
Josef Dobes, the minister of school beings, youth and body education would have convinced the fissured parties of an agreement gladly within the biggest sport association of the country.
It stands a lot indeed on the game: state allowances, the Vertrauungswürdigkeit of the Czech soccer and also the pending general meeting of the ČSTV which is supposed to show the new direction to the Czech sport according to the finance problems from Sazka.
Paclík goes into the fight around the position of the chairperson because he does not see any suitable candidate
When Tomás Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers in front of the exceptional general meeting a strong candidate that would have filled to all his ideas about the new chairpersons of the soccer association to the Czech republic (FAČR) could have formed he would not have accepted the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good candidate, I would fight for it then and renounce the choice."
"But in the present situation did not succeed in finding such an adept", said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík, to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, is to prevent it therefore, that the alleged favorites of the choice, Pelta that top of the FAČR reaches.
Paclík also stresses that he proposes in the case of his victory to carry out the function of the chairperson only a year therefore to 2013, up to the appointment the tidy general meeting.
In the position of the chairperson he would have found out one gladly top manager seen, that is not knitted all too much into the soccer event.
"With some relevant people I personally spoke."
Hardly to believe that some said to me they did not want to identify currently with the Czech soccer.
"Such opinions would have changed gladly", he mentioned.
The most out of everything Paclík supposedly interrupts the connection Pelta's with the chairperson of the Pilsner district soccer association novel Berbr, a man with controversial call that is regarded as a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegatee votes on general meetings.
For Paclík it is unacceptable for this reason, that Pelta would have the position of the chairperson inne.
"With his victory the present state would be conserved and in the Czech soccer it would not precede at all."
"The support through Berbr, one clever Businessman, would agree with the soccer twice badly", emphatical Paclík.
With that it alludes also to Pelta's name some time ago in connection with Telefonabhörungen for the determination in a Korruptionsaffaire which Pelta, however, punishment-freely followed from falling.
"I do not know, which prestige a victory of Pelta to the (tsch.) Soccer should bring in."
"And how we would "stand" in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA", said řekl Paclík, his former saying, "he will sell the Pilsner soccer club if Pelta becomes chairperson" nevertheless already a little calm sees.
If Paclík should triumph in the Thursday choice, he can absolutely imagine, however, a future cooperation with Pelta.
Just the same also a further candidate thinks - Rajchl that Paclík in front of the general meeting in October had supported that ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
"He has great abilities".
"I could imagine it well for example as a head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that it is able to guide the association as managers."
"Nevertheless I do not put my nose into matters which I do not know anything about", said Paclík who had guaranteed for sensation in September with his being in front behind the recall of the referee commission with Luďěk Macela, who Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims, he feels increased to the role of the association chairperson.
And refers in this case to his abilities with the management from private companies, since last summer he is also a head of Pilsen that celebrated the first triumph with his support in May in the league.
"I have the Power in order to change something in the soccer environment and to contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to restrict the influence of certain pressure groups that tend dazu to influence Disziplinar- and appointment commissions what degenerates until disgusting situations", Paclík mentioned that does not do any secret from his antipathy for example towards the Sparta-leader Daniel Křetínský.
He would regard as one of his priorities the Festigung of the relationships between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help it would become with the political top politicians lobbyieren, that more money flows from the lottery tax into the sport.
"That is one of the decisive things which the new chairperson should dedicate himself to".
"If it results in the taxation of luck games how the political parties declare, then I understand their argumentation, then they must say, however, where the money goes also klipp and clearly", he said.
Paclík does also not regard his connection to the Pilsner club as Handicap although he himself stresses the chairperson of the FAČR must be "überparteilich".
Pelta in turn is united with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prager Dukla.
"That is just not ideal."
A lot of sense does not do to my opinion, however, either, to transmit my stocks to a third person hypocritically in the Pilsner club in order to return after one and a half years again" Paclík explained.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR which would exclude a stalemate-situation in the future.
One of the candidates for the chairperson office, that is Miroslav Pelta, promised two days in front of the general meeting of the soccer association it will look strong in the case of his choice for that, that the FAČR gets new statute, that in future exclude quarrels about the election regulation from the beginning.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiations in Nymburk and believes, the election campaign will the Czech selection surely defuse itself with a possible success.
Pelta had promised already before the not realized choice in September, he wants to concentrate in the case of his choice on the national team and the production of finance means.
He decided first onto the last moment, to participate in the choice before the last general meeting and so the two month long pause liked to help him, to defend and to introduce in a wider context his ideas about the management of the soccer.
"People on all levels dedicate themselves to the soccer, they are impatient and they expect therefore that the chairperson is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is highest time, the man that is united particularly with the Jablonecer club that but also many years near Sparta and in the executive committee acted thinks that the association is guided by somebody.
Also therefore it thinks that it has sufficient experiences in order to lead the Czech soccer.
It is convinced, that for the present problems with the choice the euphoria that prevailed at times of Ivan Hasek is responsible.
"Unfortunately statutes which were not as complete as they all had picked up were approved of during the general meeting in June.
If they had allowed interpretations not different, we would have "had" from September already a chairperson", thought Pelta.
Just the reworking of the most important document of the civil union it used as baits for the delegatees.
I "should" become "chairperson, then I take care of that personally and am to bear responsibility personally readily if it does not bang."
"That is a fundamental thing without which he can not be", says Pelta.
Furthermore he does not attempt to distance oneself opposite his opponents.
Already formerly it had announced he can imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl that he acknowledges because of his juridical education and knows good that his opponent would be his first deputy.
It which did not let in turn any dry thread at Pelta did already long not attack also Tomás Paclík anymore.
In the soccer he moves himself already over a year and can refer already to certain successes."
"His attacks were, however, reducing and many people were shocked from his choice campaign."
"Also therefore doubt now a lot of at his real character", addressed Pelta his opponent that remains loyal to presumably his Proklamierungen that have expressed it already in September.
In his opinion his strongest arm is the knowledge of the soccer of the lowest game classes, up to the national team.
And this should be the sign of Czech soccer.
"I would make an effort also for ending all Affairen - of the Causa of Bohemians, up to the reverberations of the corruption scandal of the last year."
"Now after that I would become me on negotiations with the private and state sector" the forty-six year old candidate ČTK two months ago said "to fall in order to guarantee sufficient finance means for the whole soccer".
Then he also promised that his entry into the top of the Czech soccer will not mean any staff purges.
"I would have to vertraut machen first once with the job definition of all employees", he said in the direction to Strahov, where there is nervousness due to the long anarchy understandably.
In spite of the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios who accompany the pending general meeting he believes that the delegatees do not go on Thursday for nothing according to Nymburk.
"If the only point in dispute should really be how one chooses in the third round then we get over that."
"The soccer needs plausibility and it recovers that one only through that if he has a new Leader at last" Pelta remains optimistic two days before the possibly decisive day of his official career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR begins under it to work in a hard way
If the previous deputy chairperson Jindřich Rajchl should be elected as the new chairperson of the soccer association of the Czech Republic on the general meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly become to many people in the association the mood vermiesen.
Rajchl promises indeed that one begins in the case of his choice to work in a hard way.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for single soccer fields.
In addition he promised to solve the case Bohemians, to improve the relationships to the UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the soccer and to continue the work that the previous presiding Ivan Hasek began otherwise.
"As a chairperson I would like to dedicate myself to the soccer as a whole."
Begun by the international contacts to the UEFA and FIFA, about the national selection, the professional soccer, up to the achievement soccer for the youth."
"In this way I do not want to say that I want to make everything alone", said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
"I am a team player and would like to distribute the competences so therefore that every member dedicates himself to a certain field in the executive committee."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the soccer gets on with mile steps in every segment."
About that many would not be just delighted, because they, to criticize only instead of the work other, even really to work in a hard way now would have to begin", he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the soccer movement took into consideration not to run at all more.
"From me it is known that I work on the day 20 hours."
"But I must know that it does sense and that people that do not fling me sticks incessantly between the legs and question every step that I do support me", he said as a declaration why he hesitated.
"Many people said, however, to me that I must not give up because also others would do it otherwise."
"That is confidence which one must not verspielen", he said.
Supposedly being allowed to continue the work which he began under Hasek also motivates him.
"In two years we overcame a big piece work and I do simply not want to throw that away now."
Processes were started that do presumably not become noticeable before in a few years and see I would become only reluctant "that they" meant "somebody stopp", it and express his objections with that, that for the case, that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be chosen, the situation into the times in front of Hasek could return.
"I believe in systematic procedure and that is something which does not bring Mirek Pelta."
"Particularly people who would make the soccer like this that it was only still there for chosen ones support it."
One can reproach me for presumably some, however not, that I would be biased."
"I make an effort for being objective."
"I want soccer for all, because all are fine then and not only the Auserwählten", noticed Rajchl.
It contradicts also the claim, he is only a chairperson of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim the opposite, I really plan to do the best possible thing for old mares."
"For example it is time to consider whether one should not subdivide the league that winners climbed up in each case then into the first league into a Czech and a mährischen part."
"Then it could not happen, that only three mährische clubs play today what especially for the young players a problem is in old mares in the league", Rajchl means.
Because also the head of the Pilsner club Tomás Paclík followed the fight for the function of the chairperson now, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that it is chosen.
"I verspüre a strong support in the Czech chamber that elected me as their deputy chairperson and recognizes me now that clear successes stand behind me", Rajchl mentioned, that also the saving of zig millions of crowns for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of TV contracts and the negotiations around the lottery law as his success looks.
On the other hand he blames himself partially for the association not pulling at a single rope.
While he is saying from Pelta "it is from the beginning disqualified to help to the Czech soccer to new confidence", it holds the second rival - Paclík for a strong candidate that really has to offer something to the soccer.
"Nobody can question, that it achieved distinguished work in Pilsen only in a year."
"If it "should" be chosen, then he would carry on presumably the things, the Ivan Hasek introduced and it would not change also the staff occupation in the commissions fundamentally obviously."
It would surely not "want" to bend" the things" "for his advantages", Rajchl judges his rival.
