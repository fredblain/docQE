The court approves the crossing onto the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The adaptation of the analogous ones to digital signals belongs in the last years to the most important changes worldwide.
The Uppermost court of justice of Mexico (SCJN) showed the constitution complaints that were submitted by the senate and the parliament against the presidential decree and must be brought forward by virtue of the the switchover of analogous onto digital signals of 2021 on 2015, due to lacking eight voices that are necessary to the law contestation back.
A minority of four ministers, under that also the president of the Uppermost Court of Justice, Juan Silva Meza, thought the president Felipe Calderón did not exceed his responsibilities when he handed over the law decree with the details about the switchover on the terrestrial digital television.
With this decision the constitution quarrel started up by the senate was refused since he did not receive the necessary qualified majority of eight voices so that the court can decide itself on the constitution moderateness or the non-Verfassungsmäßigkeit. The law in force remains like this.
In the project for the complaint that was elaborated by the minister Olga Sánchez Cordero it was suggested to declare the law decree as unconstitutional there for those ones regulations affecting the radio and the television the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Feather ale commission for telecommunication in Mexico) responsible is, for which the law decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and the law reservations.
For the benefit of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted.
With this argument both the senate and the chamber of deputies submitted constitution complaints against the law decree. According to assumption of the complaints the minister Sánchez Cordero did not use the law decree anymore and stopped all activities to the equipment of the digital transfer.
The Council of Ministers refused also the complaint submitted by the chamber of deputies without kicking in into the debate about the project for which also the minister Sánchez Cordero was responsible in this case.
In his contribution the Prime Minister expressed, not to be agreed on the arguments of the project, and indeed in the sense that the country government must not adjust with general rules the measures that the public administration is supposed to take.
"I do not believe either that the independence of the regulation place would be influenced if one did that". It reminded also of that, that for the planning of strategic political fields, as for example the sector of the telecommunication, for constitution-legal reasons the central-governmental government responsible is, because this leads the state affairs.
The substitute of the analogous signals through digital is one of the most important changes that occurred in the last years on the whole world and it causes a better use of the radio-electric spectrum, an increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponing of the adaptation, it thought a postponing of the usufruct of the digitalization is what a decision that has points of view not only technical is in the public interest because she grasps economical, social, political and safeguarding aspects."
It accentuated, these matters, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of the economical management through the state they contained a group of features that the constitution puts into the hands of the central-governmental government."
It called into the memory, that many countries would already have carried out the digital adaptation worldwide, and indeed over the government, although they were in charge of highly specialized facilities.
One can not conclude that the government with the publication of the contested law decree intervenes in the competences of the congress, because the laws passed by the legislative would be kept", she assured.
