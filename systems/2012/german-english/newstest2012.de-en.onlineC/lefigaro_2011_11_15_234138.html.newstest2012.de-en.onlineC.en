The world gemäβ the republican premiership candidates'
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are rivals in simplification and ignorance concerning China, Iraq as well as the support for Israel.
A crisis-weakened America keeps up a complex world simple, in order not to say: simple ideas lead?
If one listens to the republican premiership candidates so, the voters could get almost this impression.
For some days Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their combatants are letting their thundering declarations as well as their statements concerning the Auβenpolitik, traditional republican emphasis, repeatedly verlautbaren.
About China, Iran and the Israel help fall - underpinned frequently in keinster manner - slogans.
The Mitt Romney standing highest with regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party" in the course tended to summon the Chinese before the WTO and they der"Währungsmanipulation - leading topic in an America, that through the migration of entire branches of industry to Asia onto the Äuβerste is stimulated -" accuse.
Stupidly run, when this the initiation of an economic war is supposed to imply, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador in China under Obama and only candidate to whom an advanced vision seems to have from Auβenpolitik almost strangled with regard to his behavior flattering the emotions.
He had called for a solid, but constructive conversation exchange with Peking (also the current attitude Obamas).
But Huntsman is not heard since it stagnates in the depths of the opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had praised also military strokes against Iran if the sanctions to the Stoppung of the nuclear program should fail.
"If I am elected, I stop Iran" it had sounded.
"If Obama is wiedergewählt, they get the bomb".
Auβerdem has to be promised it Israel increasing military help and stayed accused of Obama, this partner opposite obligations guilty.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second-highest seated candidate, a shameful file ignorance for the show supports for his part.
Recently he called dazu to give the Chinese military threat cons to develop Peking"versuche there a nuclear power "- and seemed in this case the fact auβer eighth let, that China is already since 1964" in the possession of military atomic arms"!
The Texan governor Rick Perry who supports Israel and demands military strokes against Iran äuβert for his part, ready for being to take the American army into Mexico against drug cartels in service.
The resort forbidden by Obama 2009 to Foltermaβnahmen opposite mutmaβlichen terrorists was approved also from Cain, Perry as well as the candidate ion Michele Bachmann.
One is to an auβenpolitischen heavyweight far from John McCain, the republican candidate in the year 2008.
The towards current premiership opponents, Reagan had also simple ideas and won the Cold War in spite of all that.
You call into memory, that also Obama selbstein is an amateur and had to give water into his wine, which affected the topic antiterror.
You insist to right on the failure of his naive dialog with Iran, the rash withdrawal seiner"Jungs" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which was also the call of the weakness to him worth.
This ill will is not, however, very so casual.
The population rather estimates the positive balance of the National security under Obama which Bin Laden eliminated.
Since Iraq she bewares of military interventions which lead to the tiring.
And Obama surprisedly more measured for when he argues, America must be built up economical again, in order to raise his leadership position to new life.
