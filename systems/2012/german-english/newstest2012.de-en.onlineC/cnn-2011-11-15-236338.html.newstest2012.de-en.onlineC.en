Urgent warnings from the pentagon of possible incisions in the defense being
Defense minister Leon Panetta gave off a good heat to the congress on Monday, when it warned against automatic budget shortenings weakening the national security without being noticed. In this way it solved a financial nuclear chain reaction from the halls of the pentagon up to the theaters of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The pentagon thinks over already shortenings at the level of 450 trillion dollars in the course of the coming decade, fears now, however, that further shortenings become necessary around 600 trillion dollars or more if the congress can not achieve any end in the editions.
"The effects of these shortenings would be disastrous for the ministry", wrote Panetta John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, in a letter onto the republican senators.
He said, a failure of the congress in the achieving of a budget agreement, what will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead a stop of numerous new projects to general shortenings to 23% as well as.
"Such a high shortening, carried out in such thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and damage other modernization efforts seriously", wrote Panetta the senators.
"We would be in addition forced, to separate us from a majority of our civilian personnel compulsorily and since the reduction was turned over so quickly we would have to relieve civilians with probability verging on security in order to be able to reach the objective."
"These changes would destroy the belief of the ones who receive our military uprightly and damage our alert seriously."
Finally the shortenings hit the combat troops", Panetta said.
"While the wartime contingents are being directly not affected by the seizure in the antiterror fight, the fatal intervention in the basic budget would influence the war efforts disadvantageously", Panetta warned.
"Personnel attitudes shortened, what to delays in the attitudes and the attitude supervision that supports the war would lead."
"The salaries of the personnel would be shortened, what leads to late payments onto wartime traders and the legal one as also political support would be faulty."
The two senators answered to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details concerning the potential influence of the automatic shortenings on the Ministry of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defense would initiate a fast downfall of the United States as leading military power of the world."
"We are vehement against this Draconian action", said the senators in a common declaration on Monday afternoon, when they published to Panettas letter.
"This is a result with which we can not live, and it is not certainly any one that one should force on us."
"The seizure is a threat of the national security interests of the United Statten and their entry should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators will increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget or will intensify demands, to wait to exclude the pentagon from shortenings, remains.
Panetta expressed increasingly bluntly the possible shortenings although it could gain experiences with the budget many years in the congress and in the White House, before it came onto the top of the pentagon, and he knows that it suits difficult decisions opposite.
On a press conference in the last week the defense minister painted it a dark picture what could approach - a military with shell, but without core.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an air force wing without sufficiently trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of the barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers which are in the situation to fulfill the mission", said Panetta in his opening address in the pentagon.
It is some armed forces which lacks morality and alert and which is not in the situation to match potential opponents."
"It makes one become furious in fact."
In an appendix to his letters at McCain and Graham Panetta mentioned new details, as reductions "significant functional risks creates: Delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions of our worldwide use and intervening ability, what leads to an inacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the greatest defense projects of the cancellation could fall victim including the ones that already were tested and are already in the early planning stage.
Also the combat pilot F35 Joint Strike Fighter belongs to this list, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground assault vehicle, the Army and navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
One stopped the further development and the tests of the F35, this would save in the next 10 years up to 80 trillion dollars, but the proponents say that it is an important next step to the rearmament so that possible dangers through China and other opponents can be excommunicated.
