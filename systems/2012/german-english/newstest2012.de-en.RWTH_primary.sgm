<seg id="30">
With information on the types of characters angefüllte Saturday presentation was peppered from three visitors from the industry:
</seg>
<seg id="31">
The Stylisten Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and a Stylist should be able to take advantage of this.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
And eingeschickter Stylist able to work with a single piece of clothing in a different way.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
The magic word is variability.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
For example, a Trenchcoat as usual on the jeans, a T-shirt or coat, you can but also on the naked body, (shoes to attract and hire him as a dress.

<seg id="36">
It is, the sleeves or the collar sleeves and, the whole look quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"So," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Most came to me but the following advice: "Think you know the rules perfect."
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"Only then can they violate them," said Jakub.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40">
At last, it is clear to me why we need to all these theories, which can be combined with what and why, even if on display in fashion journals often quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="41">
Not to mention of fashion look.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42">
Thanks to the photographer Ben I know now that must have prepared a Stylist much more clothing options when he ultimately photographed.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
So it must be for a Fashion story with ten pages (read ten attire) be prepared to stylen at least fifteen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes quite differently than in reality.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
With all of that is so in shaping the attire.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46">
That image and Styl sometimes half the success that we also confirmed Jan Pokorný.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
You need only to look at Madonna, not just a brilliant singer, have made the image and marketing a world star.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
In the Czech Republic is the services of Stylisten rather reserved.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Even celebrities often believe that this is wasted money (the main thing is that I am, how I au naturel secondary).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50">
And if stylen itself any of us, then we expect that he or she is likely a different (smaller) imposing size, as he or she really needs.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
We need to googlen then only to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes, the celebrity have again or decreased, etc.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52">
Jan and Mario laid on Sunday, not to believe that a Stylist to focus only on the fashion and then the cloth "assemble" needs.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
In his work, he must communicate with the people he stylt and he must be a psychologist.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
People judge without curry and, in his opinion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">
"If any manager to sift through their clothes, and to complement beautiful pieces, then it does not remove the entire cupboard - my God, this is terrible."
</seg>
<seg id="56">
"We must find at least a few good things, which recommends what to take it," says Mario.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57">
He also showed us exactly what a so-called "pocket" must include.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
So a bag that zuknöpft the waists and bears in all necessary Proprietäten.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
In such clear terms, such as scissors, Abroller for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains Utensilien, as a nylon thread (thus helps the Stylist the photographing of products such as handbags or meting out from), specific clips, which tightened up the clothes, if it is too big (Stecknadeln or other Klemmen are banned, so that the substance is not broken) and, of course, Nähzeug.

Sure - are potentially quite decent Arkade race, but will reduce the risk of some unnecessary mistakes that are in this series more or less for a few years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So there are actually no more mistakes, but rather in principle, signs of incomprehensible laziness of the games developers.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The adventure begins very well.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
History will be in the first instance, whose main character Jack introduced certain problems personal nature; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
In San Francisco, on the west coast, set the wheel - with the task to be first in New York.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The whole route is divided into ten stages and in more than fifty individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
This means that every race with each other, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting environment.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
No one has the impression that the game would offer the same.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Some areas are still very attractive, although the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
So nothing earth-shattering news.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
But the trip through the desert, through herbstliche landscape or high by deep verschneite landscape we visually very pleasant.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Occasionally bring atypical elements a little change in the individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
In the desert, for example, is surprised by a desert storm, which reduces the term.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
In the mountains, in turn, you have to be careful step that will not be buried by an avalanche.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Incidentally, are fairly well in the individual race.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Only a few, but they are.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
For a while trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle a classic race), it has to make up time (classic race against the stopwatch), then expect a personal duel with a single counterparty.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
And this is also the police, who wants to blow the whole thing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaving the car.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
It is more about some interactive animation, in which Jack fleeing from anyone and where he must help the players, he is the right moment the right button.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
So nothing complicated.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31">
Surprisingly, however, that the game is much less such passages, as one would expect (actually only three).
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Ultimately, this is the case with the advantage, because it has this element at least a chance to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game sweeteners.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33">
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen of previous parts.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
This means that from today's point of view, there are no trees, on the other hand, could not be said that it would be bad.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Those who seek realistic simulations, must look elsewhere.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
But an aktionsgeladenen Rennfahren the European Fahrmodell continue quite well, although it could be found in the competition.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
Until then, everything is peachy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Real problems arise only after a certain time.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
Unlike Fahrmodell is not the collision model quite OK.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
This type of a game is hardly to be expected that complicated deformities and collisions calculated, but if you have virtually no impact on any object idea as to how the car, then obviously not everything is in order.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
Case in point: the close do so or those driving to oncoming cars "scratches" on the other cars only slightly, in others, almost identical situation, but went into a tailspin, and wild pirouetting.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Or the Karre to scrap.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43">
Thanks to the rest of the system makes nothing, annoying is it all the time.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
The rest of Arts are resolved that, if it has destroyed or far away from the route ends up, then the game back to the last point of reference.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Only - in every race has only five rest of Arts.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
If they have been exhausted, everything is starting from scratch.
</seg>
<seg id="47">
The rest of Arts, rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but we prefer not to rely on.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48">
Sometimes helps but not the rest of nature, and nothing other than the critical section from the head to learn.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Extremely unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
Some curves must pass through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise it is not easy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
Elsewhere, the relevant department "civilian" cars are in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or a minute later.
</seg>
<seg id="52">
This is particularly galling in situations when you see that the Kontrahent before a romped to two oncoming cars, but until you arrive, the cars are already in such a position that they must slow down or avoid it.
</seg>
<seg id="53">
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54">
The opponents have other advantages.
</seg>
<seg id="55">
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is being overtaken by the same opponents at the same point and again regardless of the time.
</seg>
<seg id="56">
The Madman Estonians, this is at the end of the game in the long bridge in opposite direction.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
The Kontrahent must clearly hell bent on overtake.
</seg>
<seg id="58">
And if he is just a, then it is, of course, the point of view, so we drove there initially by car a few times in Klump.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59">
Clearly, it is simply the game more exciting and more exciting but it is clear that spoiled them quickly the joy of the game.
</seg>
<seg id="60">
And that is a pity, because despite a simpler Fahrmodell is aktionsgeladen the game as a whole rather entertaining and sometimes so that we do not know almost more, where one of the head.
</seg>
<seg id="61">
And, in principle, no matter what "responsible" - the concept of fifty unique routes, the Order of the race in a way that can avoid boredom, or something else...
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="62">
An unusual idea is also the change in the course of the race.
</seg>
<seg id="63">
We must not overlook the petrol station on the road, because that's where you can change the car, although in most cases the car enough.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="64">
The cars are divided into three categories.
</seg>
<seg id="65">
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for the alternate motorways and exotic super sports cars for technical operations, such as the Serpentinen in the mountains.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66">
Hand in hand with the way the game's history is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the premises of history.
</seg>
<seg id="67">
There is not only medals, but also to gain experience points for their own profile, together for the tasks (challenges) and history.
</seg>
<seg id="68">
In order to reach a higher level, drivers must be different items, ranging from cars to the Backgrounds for the profile.
</seg>
<seg id="69">
This is linked to the online function Autolog at the same time, among other things, its own results compared with those of other players and also for further collective functions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70">
One of the more incomprehensible Schnitzern is a situation last race in history.
</seg>
<seg id="71">
Here is one with the car in a subway tunnel (I), where desecrate kept in the dark on the rail for (or).
</seg>
<seg id="72">
On the speed dial look between paragraphs 150 (a) 200 km/h (or), but it is suddenly from behind a subway and a drive to scrap.
</seg>
<seg id="73">
In our editorial will argue we probably still have a long time about whether a blackout of the game makers, or keep the authors so stupid.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74">
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases, appealing and sometimes even brilliant.
</seg>
<seg id="75">
Even more galling is that some exciting moments the Bildwiederholfrequenz slows and sometimes quite dramatically.
</seg>
<seg id="76">
However, this is in particular the accidents with greater number of parties, where a continuous FPS useless anyway.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77">
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is taste.
</seg>
<seg id="78">
In a bid to such a broad scale as possible rather young audience, created a Sound Track a lá "from any something" - but anyone who buys such a game because of the music?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
The overall impression of Need for steroids: the run? The feelings are more mixed.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
If the game is not offset by the aforementioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we would have of conviction can claim that the run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
But the game somehow unfinished.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
For a great pleasure, but we should be prepared for the fact that these mistakes with the power of airport lights in the eye.

"The Treaty of Lisbon has brought the balance among the various institutions felt out of kilter."

<seg id="4">
I would not expect such a hard war flares. "
</seg>
<seg id="5">
"It will take five to six years, until the dust settles and we have all become accustomed to their new role," began girl Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, in her lecture at the law faculty.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
How seriously it takes the motto "Verständlich and openly about Europe ," they showed in the first part of their presentation, in which it was able to describe the various EU institutions and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way to describe that some editor of the University of Karlsruhe might envy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Mrs Vicenová also praised the new chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"Initially, criticism that he is too low-key - a grey officer, was incapable of such a role, but I must say that it has brought all the time, as well he has taken up the cause.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"He is a person who is ready to listen to twenty-seven member states patiently, communicate with and has particularly clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy said they then the answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? What number to I call? ," as an important step towards integration and better visibility of the EU's Policy towards countries such as China or India.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
No one wants to our Ölmützer Quargel ban
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
Mrs Vicenová was also on the agenda, the of the European Union, and intends to live in the near future.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The Czech presidency two years ago, describing it as a success.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
The Czechs had handled the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the summit for the Eastern Partnership.

The case of the government during the Presidency, describing it as a major negative, which have damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In the words of the ambassador said, it was not only the presidency, but also in the subsequent crisis, which is not yet quite hectic.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
And it must be approved the seven-year EU budget, which makes it precisely because of the current economic situation much more complicated.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Whether it is a slim and thrifty budget, which will take precedence which countries more or less - all of that is now on the agenda.

</p>
<p>

The ambassador also recalls their own slogans with which they came to Brussels: "Verständlich on Europe."

<seg id="21">
"If I do not, then it know acronym, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.

<p>
<seg id="25">
The EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation to be Eurosceptics, the more the negative than positive sides of the issue.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Even more galling is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
There are many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, whose inability to write letters and motivation, the weak support for the Czech side.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency emphasised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad group, the so-called V4.
</seg>

"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and the Slovaks in the vicinity, believes the Frenchman next to me:" Hey, what is their heads together - is once again your V4? "and it makes a pretty face acid.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Mrs Vicenové according to the EU in the future, especially hard rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
As a much fairer, as a "European federation" is the concept of an Europe of two or even different speeds.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
"We have here the eurozone countries and the countries outside the euro zone.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute, fully cooperation."

"For the first time, it was said that should cooperate only the countries that want it and those who do not want to stand aside."

"There will be more and more of these institutions, which ultimately leads to a strong" multi-speed Europe ," "Mrs Vicenová expected.

In this regard, they also paid tribute to the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the enforcement of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU by all member states, and only by the countries of the euro zone.

The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence

They wanted to look for a suitable word that characterized the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word "longevity."
</seg>
<seg id="4">
For the general public is IBM synonymous with technological revolution, it is known as a modern businesses, although a century has passed since its establishment.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The basis of this longevity, already presented its first chief - the visionary Thomas j. Watson.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
Already he considered the slogan, countless were easily solve global problems, if people were willing to consider a bit.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
His slogan "Think!" was the brand, the lives of future giants should take place (and at the same time, the title of intra-group magazine which IBM in 1935 began).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
This was also the basis of the Watsen thoroughly prepared business culture.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"For us from IBM means this long-term thinking a kontinuelle movement towards the future.

<seg id="10">
IBM survived and was also an entire century, because it has remained faithful to its principles and not shied away from everything else around it.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Watson was already in the thirties social care of its employees - in a similar way, as the company Baa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had as one of the first American workers paid holidays, an insurance through the employer plus elegant uniforms and working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
As more sophisticated IBM's long-term relationships with their customers.

<seg id="16">
The company was brilliant in the talent from the outset - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM any discrimination - and could choose accordingly.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, will invariably the Palmisan at the head of IBM next year by a woman - of Virginia Rometty.

<seg id="18">
It is thirty years by IBM, have so far adopted the position of the Vetriebs, head of marketing and strategy.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
IBM makes in recent years, so-called online brainstorming session, from which stem many future strategies and innovations.

No wonder - there is no shortage of ideas, the company employs is almost half a million people.

"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that the business problems through technology helps solve," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.

The name IBM took over until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.

Development of the travel prices since 1989
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
By 1989, the then ČSSR only five authorized government travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Travel agents sold only travel to the socialist bloc countries in the West were only chosen at the time.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
And so, Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), in the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), after Bulgaria and Romania, the Black Sea and Hungary workplaces.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and so the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
A great paradox of the socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) was allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For example, if a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he took a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were not individual trips.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
Even then, travel agents and travel in the West, but then had to be huge queues in, or spend the night in sleeping bags in the travel office, or at least "good friends" in the travel office.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
So was not the cause.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit to the West - was given only "politically reliable" people - the others were allowed to travel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Czechoslovakia's currency was not umtauschbare currency freely without foreign currency, it would have been impossible to the necessary financial resources (Western currency) find for a trip to the West.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The journey most Czechs spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that bought the Czechs countless weekend homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The Velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, spent the Czechs last year 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
A huge paradox, is not aware of it, is the fact that the most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - could not travel at all until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Right from the beginning of the 90 s, the foreign exchange duty in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe lifted, above all, what a huge wave of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
The Tschechoslowaken could not get for a long time to travel to the West simply enough, everyone wanted to have at least a few days since.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
So slept the Czech holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for accommodation in the hotel or a pension.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a length of canned beer and sausages, etc. vollgepackter boot.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech koruna - after decades were able to buy our tourists Western currency.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Our standard of living and, consequently, the average salaries rose to what einmündete 1997 in another important moment.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to prepare the travel agents after 1997 regularly travel by chartered flights, making air travel, thanks to the opportunity to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past incredibly cheap.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23">
At the end of the 90 s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payment with all advanced countries in the world, making travel easier.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Another interesting moment in the history of the "velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, when the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - after Thailand.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
Every year since then fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in far-off sunny countries; this year flies directly from the Czech Republic twelve exotic destinations.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Another important moment in the era that our "post-revolutionary" marked development, came in 2008.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
On 17 November 2008, the U.S. visa requirement for Czech tourists, which our country is definitely among the world's advanced countries brutalized.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time, more than half of their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they gave to a single holiday residence, including the cost of holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd CZK per capita.

Almost five months, the Czech football no chairman and that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech football Association (FAČR) will be even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk known.

To date, there is still no agreement on what is to be elected electoral law.

<p>
<seg id="6">
In June, Hašek resigned from his post, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to come together and find a strong personality could run the football in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
Only - in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two associations chambers again able to agree on a common candidate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, as the new leader should be chosen.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
The delegates at the General Assembly were free of the People's House in Prague quarter Smíchov come, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
We could not agree about who is in the full collection actually vote - only the statutory representative or with a power of officials.

<p>
<seg id="11">
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the right, whose opinion representation in power base is not admissible.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
The dispute over the election law, however, continue to take.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The Executive Committee did not have more clarity on the matter, whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else on the agenda.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Even if the views on the election a few times - the worst point remained the same.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
The question is: how can we in the 3 st round in order to avoid a stalemate?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"The point of contention is the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statute, or whether a different model must be found," said dušan Svoboda, one of the three deputy chairman of the FAČR, representing management in professional football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
According to a registered model prevails in the third round the one candidate who receives the greater disposable support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Moravia is reportedly ready to respond to the compromise that the one candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The Czech Republic, on the condition that the winner of the other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
"We have the two Vorrunden make no sense, this method would put the entire bicameral concept in question," Svoboda understands the objections of Moravian side that it would be best, not tweaking the electoral law, but to elect under current statutes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees with this, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral law of all the candidates most likely Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It is my wish that largely elected under the statute."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"So that no unreasonable ersatz variants, such as at the last General Assembly," said the owner (the clubs) Victoria Plzeň, particularly Pelta abgrenzte stood for the first time and in his opinions.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
Pelta but remains optimistic.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
In his view, the new chairman Nymburk known and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European football championship today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
</seg>
<seg id="27">
"If the football until the euphoric wave, it is also the willingness to cooperate more," said the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten the most experience, both on a professional, and regional levels.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
Rajchl is more circumspect.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"I hope to reach an agreement, but the situation is, unfortunately, is ambivalent."

<seg id="30">
"This is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts, the rules for their own purposes" fudge ." "
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"It is a new block in the General Assembly cannot be ruled out."

<seg id="32">
"I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.

Only - a lot of time on the agreement of all sides.

<seg id="34">
Some negotiations should take place allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the generals until qualification at all.

<seg id="35">
The charter plane, fly, inter alia, Dalai boron Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice, was not in the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction at all, and so was urgently for a replacement variant, as part of the executive committee on the venue of the Barrage Hinspiels.

Paclík also stressed that he only if he wins the role of the chairman a year, until 2013, until the date of the proper main assembly.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="45">
In the position of chairman, he would like to hear a top managers, not too much in football events.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I have personally spoken with some of the people in question."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
"Hard to believe that some said they wanted to identify with the Czech football.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="49">
Most of all disturbs Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's link with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association novel Berbr, a man with kontroversem reputation, which is behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.

It is for this reason for Paclík unacceptable that Pelta holds the position of the chairman.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="51">
"His victory would einkonserviert and the Czech football is not making any progress at all."

<seg id="54">
"I do not know what the victory of Pelta (tsch.) should play football."
</seg>
<seg id="55">
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, its previous formula, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman" looks a little more calmly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56">
Should Paclík in Thursday's election win, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta well.
</seg>
<seg id="57">
Just think of another candidate - Rajchl, had supported the Paclík before the General Assembly in October, which ended in a fiasco.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58">
"He (Pelta) would be the first to which I would go."
</seg>
<seg id="59">
"He has great skills."
</seg>
<seg id="60">
"I could imagine him well, for example, as head of the national team."
</seg>
<seg id="61">
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
</seg>
<seg id="62">
"I am putting my nose in matters of which I understand nothing," said Paclík, who had been in September that he was behind the resignation of the Commission with referee Luďěk Macela was at the Dagmar Damková.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63">
Paclík claimed, he felt the role of the chairman of the association.
</seg>
<seg id="64">
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms, since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May celebrated the first triumph in the League.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65">
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to the cultivation of this."

<seg id="66">
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal commissions, which turn up in horrific situations ," Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy for example, to the Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="67">
As one of its priorities, the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with whose help he would evoke the political leaders to ensure that more money from the lottery tax in the sport.

"This is not ideal."

Pelta promised new statutes of FAČR, the ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.

Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association promised one of the candidates for the post of chairman, Miroslav Pelta, if elected, he will ensure that the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law.

Pelta promised not carried out before the election in September that he wants to do in the event of his election to the national team and the collection of funds.

He decided at the last moment, to participate in the election before the last General Assembly, and so did help him the two-month pause to defend his ideas on the running of football and in a broader context.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="79">
"People at all levels is devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect that the chairman on Thursday."

"He feels that it is high time that the Association is led by someone, says the man who is particularly associated with the Jablonecer club, but also many years in Sparta and the executive committee.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
This is also why he says that he does not have sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
He is convinced that is responsible for the current problems with the election of the euphoria that existed at the time of Ivan Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
"Unfortunately, in the General Assembly in June approved statutes that were not perfect, as had all accepted.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have already had a chairman, "said Pelta in September.

"I should be president, I take myself personally, and I am willing to take personal responsibility, if it does not."

<seg id="87">
"This is a matter of principle, without which it cannot be," said Pelta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88">
In addition, he is not trying to differentiate themselves to his opponent.
</seg>
<seg id="89">
He had earlier announced that he could cooperate with Jindřich Rajchl imagine recognizes the because of his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent in his first deputy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="90">
Also Tomáš Paclík, he has been for a long time, which in turn, no dry thread Pelta.
</seg>
<seg id="91">
In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
</seg>
<seg id="92">
"The attacks were herabsetzend and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
</seg>
<seg id="93">
"So many doubts about his true nature," Pelta addressed his opponent, who will probably be his proclamations to which he expressed in September.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="94">
In his view, is his strongest weapon knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, to the national team.
</seg>
<seg id="95">
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.

<seg id="96">
"I would try to put an end to all Affairen - the issue Bohemians, to the halls of the corruption scandal last year."
</seg>
<seg id="97">
"Immediately afterwards I would lead to negotiations with the private and public sector to ensure sufficient funding for the whole of football," said the sechsundvierzigjährige candidate ČTK two months ago.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="98">
At the time, he promised that will mean his arrival at the tip of the Czech football staff cleansing.

"I would like to start with the job content of all employees," he said in the direction Strahov, where is due to the length of anarchy understandably nervous.

Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios that accompany the forthcoming General Assembly, he believes that the delegates on Thursday after Nymburk in vain.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
"If that is really the only point of contention, as you choose in the third round, then we come."
</seg>
<seg id="102">
"Football needs credibility and he is the only way back when he finally has a new leader" remains Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his official career optimistic.

Rajchl promises that the work of FAČR below him hard begins
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">
If the current deputy leader Jindřich Rajchl at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, would supposedly frenzy that many people in the club's whim.

Rajchl promises that in the case of his election promises to work hard.
</seg>
<seg id="106">
He wants to introduce changes and the members of the Executive Committee for individual football fields.
</seg>
<seg id="107">
He also promised to resolve the case Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="108">
"As chairman, I would like to turn to the football as a whole."
</seg>
<seg id="109">
From the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, the national selection, the professional football, to the football for the youth. "
</seg>
<seg id="110">
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in the conversation for ČTK.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="111">
"I am a team player and would distribute the competences of the executive committee that deals with each member pays a certain area."
</seg>
<seg id="112">
And I will be distributing hard tasks, so that the football in each segment with. "
</seg>
<seg id="113">
Moreover, many not just delighted because, instead of only to criticise the work of others, now itself should begin to work really hard, "he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114">
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have considered no longer to run.
</seg>
<seg id="115">
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
</seg>
<seg id="116">
"But I must know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me, not me constantly spanners in the works, and every step I am in question," he said as an explanation why he hesitated.
</seg>
<seg id="117">
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because it would otherwise do others."
</seg>
<seg id="118">
"It is trust must not squander it," he said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="119">
Allegedly motivated him to continue the work that he has begun under Hašek.
</seg>
<seg id="120">
"In two years we have accomplished a great deal of work and I do not want to throw away now."
</seg>
<seg id="121">
"Processes have been launched, the only in a few years to come, and I would hate to see that they ride," he said, and hereby expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - would be elected Miroslav Pelta, could return the situation in the days before Hašek.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="122">
"I believe in systematic approach and this is something that Mirek Pelta not."
</seg>
<seg id="123">
"Behind him, above all, people who would make the football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
</seg>
<seg id="124">
I can be some, but not that I would be biased. "
</seg>
<seg id="125">
"I am trying to be objective."
</seg>
<seg id="126">
"I don't want football for all, because it is all very well, and not just a selected," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="127">
He also rejects the claim that he was a leader of the Czechs.
</seg>
<seg id="128">
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really have to do what is best for Moravia."
</seg>
<seg id="129">
"For example, it is time to consider whether the League should not be grouped in a Czech and Moravian part, the winners in each of the first League visited."
</seg>
<seg id="130">
"It could not happen today only three Moravian clubs in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," said Rajchl.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="131">
Because now the head of the Pilsner clubs Tomáš Paclík the battle for the post of chairman, dares not Rajchl to assess his chances that he will be elected.
</seg>
<seg id="132">
"I feel a strong support in the chamber, which has been elected to its deputy chairman and now recognises that clear successes stand behind me," led Rajchl, saving tens of millions of kronor for disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as its success.
</seg>
<seg id="133">
On the other hand, it is partly to blame for the fact that the association is not a single hymn sheet.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="134">
While Pelta he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence, he believes that the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate to the football really does have something to offer."
</seg>
<seg id="135">
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
</seg>
<seg id="136">
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue with things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change."
</seg>

He would certainly not things in its favour altered want "judgements Rajchl on his rivals.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
Commodity bets were initially intended to traders to hedge against price volatility.

The planned construction of a temporary exhibition pavilion set up after the world exhibition at the Swiss garden in Vienna South station, rebuilt and opened 1962 is a museum of the 20th century opened - the "20 s house" it was called. "
</seg>
<seg id="12">
It was the buildings but not physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of art, not a good climate.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, the contemporary art in Vienna a new house.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
Since 2001 the building was empty and came more and more.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Now has converted the architect Adolf Krischanitz the pavilion, he is now "21 s House" and is used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Tuesday evening opened the museum Belvedere, one of the House, where the first exhibition - a fortune in every respect.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
Through the restart Agnes Husslein Arco, the 2007 new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
Husslein Arco, solicitor art historian with considerable career including the youth than Eiskunstläufererin later Sotheby's, the Guggenheim museum and as a founding director of the museum of Modern Salzburg, the restructuring strongly among politicians and the monument conservationists, they acquired public funds and private sponsorship funds and put the use.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
No contemporary art should be issued the works of Bildhauers Fritz Wotruba by the eponymous foundation, a cafe and a bookshop, and there should be an office House had to be built.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Strict supervision, small budget
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
For the implementation was then Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
Not only because he rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna sensitive and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him a "tremendously important" was the place where he "almost every weekend" had seen the exhibitions.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
He knew the Ur draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which was already in his transfer to Vienna and his Umnutzung of generosity and easily lost.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
In the current reconstruction there was far greater problems: the building was an Energieschleuder, "says Krischanitz."
</seg>
<seg id="25">
The profiles of the glass facade windows have been replaced, glasfaserverstärktes insulating glass and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Kältebrücken steel sources have been replaced or replaced, and asbestgefüllte blankets were rescued.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
Two shells made room for the new use, an abgesenkter light gap between house and road provides the Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The original external doors have remained, the house is deleted in the old rotbraunen rust-protection color tone.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
And the cinema is even more exactly as it was before.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
The memorial authority and all this under strict supervision and with a small budget.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
"Often had to be found a material that is good and cheap, and also the monument protection office did," says Krischanitz and points to an abrasive soil in the underground missile.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32">
Despite all the constraints, problems and building the building remained flexible and easy.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical "dropout in the City history."
</seg>
<seg id="34">
So an architecture "always in the wrong place" and wants to "create a real awareness."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35">
In this case, the 21 s house but not in the wrong place, because it is an urban stroke occurred: the Swiss garden just completely new planned "Central Station, office and residential accommodation."
</seg>
<seg id="36">
And another stroke will happen: the 21 s house could increase by another Krischanitz construction, because the Sammlerin Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin fizzled art hall, and we hear, they have been negotiating with the city a neighbourly location in the Swiss garden.

The abenteuerlichste bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.

The UBS in the financial crisis almost bankrupt, and since then has stumbled from one crisis to the next.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Now it is going to be a German.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
It was certainly not intended Axel Weber.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank was revealed in July announced that he would make 2013 an almost equally spectacular new job: Board President of the big Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland whether their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and kept warm comments about the future.
</seg>
<seg id="8">

</seg>
<seg id="9">
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."

<p>
<seg id="10">
But in September it was clear that everything would be quite different.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
A trader at UBS in London had evaded all security systems of the bank and found some 1.7 billion euros.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
UBS Chief Executive Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to leave.

The President of the Board of UBS, also damaged - and all ask: when will finally Axel Weber?

<seg id="14">
The bank was already known that Weber from February 2012 to discuss.

And the administrative presidency assumes he already in May - not only in 2013, as the bank on Tuesday.
</seg>
</p>

For Axel Weber will be hard.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
It is not a banker, an economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
At a stroke, he then assumes the responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just shown once again that they have long been deserves the title "biggest scandal bank in Europe ."
</seg>
<seg id="19">
Because the UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset managers in the world - and, on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21">
It started in the financial crisis.
</seg>
<seg id="22">
By 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
The image of the secretive and solid, but also ausgebufften Swiss wealth manager had combined with ambitious goals: they wanted to be in the investment banking is a very large number.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
On the one hand, the UBS 2007 managed to high-net-worth customers with $1.6 trillion more money than any other bank in the world.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
And on the other hand, it was as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks late.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
This made impression.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
The former banker and subsequent longtime banking analyst Hans Geiger counter in Zurich: "Do student I have portrayed the UBS was regarded as a model of good bank."
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How did I do wrong?"
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29">
He was wrong.

<seg id="30">
In 2007, for the first time that something was wrong came in the UBS.
</seg>
<seg id="31">
In the middle of the year, Chief Executive Peter Wuffli surprising hochintellektueller in the meantime, as well as ingenuous bankers.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
A few months later, suspecting he was gone.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
The investment bank had been with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
</seg>
<seg id="34">
In order to cope with the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
So it was in fact investors, but what about some until shortly before the face: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth funds, which was so quiet that they did not even have heard his name.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36">
But that was only the first blow.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
In April 2008, there was worse.
</seg>
<seg id="38">
The bank had to be new billion losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid Board Switzerland, resigned.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
In October 2008 was followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
The National bank bought the UBS for tens of billions of troubled securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a mandatory convertible bond, on which they could be Miteigentümerin the bank.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41">
The whole country was shocked, because they said, as dramatic as it is for a small country, if it is so large banks.
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Finally, the balance sheet of the UBS 2007 more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
</seg>
<seg id="43">
"Once again we could not save UBS ', says banks researchers Geiger counter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44">

</seg>
<seg id="45">
A few months later surrendered the UBS tax dispute with America, agreeing to publish the data high-net-worth clients who had evaded taxes, perhaps with the help of the bank.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
They also agreed to a payment of $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from this business and criminal charge.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47">
Thus, the UBS more or less open to help in tax evasion.
</seg>
<seg id="48">
At the same time she lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: the aura of secrecy.
</seg>
<seg id="49">
After the scandal was not Swiss banking secrecy.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
It followed the resignation of CEO and Board President.
</seg>
<seg id="51">
And the exodus of customers" money.
</seg>
</p>
<p>

It had lost the bank within months its credibility in two main business areas: in the investment banking through the false speculation and asset management assistance for tax evasion.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53">
And, just as it has been somewhat calmer, just as it was thought that now will get the UBS it again, because this is An unfortunate traders history: An individual traders found EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something was wrong.
</seg>
<seg id="54">
And it appears to be: the risk management in the investment banking is obviously still did not work.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="55">

Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its only high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.

How did it happen?
</seg>
<seg id="78">
Talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks a huge corporation.
</seg>
<seg id="80">
It was a bank that the merger was too big for the small Switzerland - and grew still further.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81">
It helped that supplemented the two different precursor banks UBS: a rich, but verschlafene bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but even more internationalized.
</seg>
<seg id="82">
Suddenly the internationalised investment bankers favourable to a lot of money with which they could a huge wheel.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83">
Two names are linked to the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banks researchers Hans Geiger counter.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
"Wuffli, higher intellectuals, Bescheidene who understands a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who has heraufgearbeitet from the bank lesson to the top."
</seg>
<seg id="86">
But Ospel have to rely on Wuffli finish.
</seg>
<seg id="87">
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger counter.
</seg>
<seg id="88">
"This is a tragic case."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="89">
Tragic, perhaps.
</seg>
<seg id="90">
It is clear: embolden came in the case.
</seg>

The leaders of UBS clearly remember the meetings at which company chief Wuffli purported to be the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.

The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.

Then the UBS, according to the top.

</p>
<p>

Some steps were their success.

Business advisers who have been charged, but stressed a weakness: in the international interest in the business, bankers "fixed-income," there is a huge gap among the world's largest banks.
</seg>
<seg id="98">
The UBS have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="99">
To close this gap, UBS in an adventure that almost cost the existence.
</seg>
<seg id="100">
Hungry for growth, the bank invested both themselves and their seats of hedge funds in American subprime assets.
</seg>
<seg id="101">
They became a huge machine that securities on American mortgage loans packaged and passed - but also risks.
</seg>
<seg id="102">
Also, as other banks for an exit.
</seg>
<seg id="103">
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the U.S. housing market in flames, has bought the UBS there," says banking expert Geiger counter.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104">
The euphoria so great, so deeply.
</seg>

A manager after another had to go to clean up the attempts were more difficult than expected.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="107">
Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.
</seg>
<seg id="108">
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which are all obvious business models.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109">
Bankenforscher Geiger counter has an idea: stop the investment-banking activities, focusing on asset management to return to the Swiss roots.
</seg>
<seg id="110">
So far, the bank is not (yet).
</seg>
<seg id="111">
But that investment banking is to shrink sharply, so much is already clear.

On Thursday will present the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti the world its future strategy.

With the loss of five of eight 36 school personnel in the public school in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, were employed, the complaint says, "This is not a neighborhood worried-but-wealthy parents who can organise the donations to offset budget cuts."

Walls have eyes: how researchers watching you on Facebook
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik, the only one of many boys who signalled their anti-immigration views online.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
On Monday, Breivik, who has committed a killing spree in Norway in July to have killed 77 people, its first public hearing in court.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
Despite Breivik, may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent much time until his attack at his computer and gechattet with some of the millions of nationalists, the extreme right-wing groups on social networks.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
But, as we find them?
</seg>
<seg id="7">
This is easy - you just have to log on Facebook.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"We have found that it was not difficult to reach them," says Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report by the British think-tank DEMOS on the digital populism in Europe.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
Facebooks hide-and-seek personal data is so enzyklopädisch, says Bartlett that must use the researchers simply advertising tool of the side in order to determine their desired demographic data with scientific precision exactly - do as retailers for years.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Bartletts team found half a million supporters of far-right groups in Europe and visierte them with Adds, but rather with a new band or to connect a new diet product, invited the Adds users to a poll in which, according to their level of education, was asked about their attitudes toward violence and the their own future.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Thanks to Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues were able to more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries - not just once her office had to leave.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"It is a fairly new research method," says Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Some of the results come as little surprise. Online supporters of far-right groups are mostly young, male and resent the immigration.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But in a kind of surprising, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
Demos work is just one example of how Facebook to be a new tool in the hands of scientists.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
Ideenfabriken, medical researchers and policy researchers use the side in order to study everything from health issues to social trends such as "Likes ," text messages and status updates.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
With more than 800 million active users who add on average three content per day, generated Facebooks "data supernova explosion" a research boom, the number of scientific work, with the name of this page title in the last five years by almost 800% increase.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For some researchers is the beauty of Facebook that can be achieved by the people who do not normally with his Clipboard on the street.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"If you tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"They had to first inform the party and would never have access," says Bartlett.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"Facebook is everything away - you go directly to them."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Others say that the side a chance to see social and health problems to solve.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
A recent study by Dr Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full binge on Facebook, are significantly more prone to problem drinking as students who remained silent on this issue.
</seg>
<seg id="24">
Moreno proposes that equivalent students, for example, residential advisers to help monitor the side and a student if they too many status updates.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"They can't solve a problem, if you have not recognized," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos co- author and director of the Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute of the Washington Post.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who otherwise would not have been found."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Facebook also zapft constantly data of its own population.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
The data team has statistics on the types of status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and produced a national happiness index (which has been used primarily according to the only Facebook access - master of digital freedom have long understood that should make the their great data treasure trove for other research purposes.) 
</seg>
<seg id="29">
But the users of Facebook that the side they are, whether they like it or not. with a friend, is thousands of miles away, to be able to play Scrabble, allows the side's own personal data sown.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
But what if the users of Facebook, part of a survey that they do not even know about?
</seg>
<seg id="31">
While researchers have set strict guidelines as to how they collect data offline, everything is permitted.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
"I do not believe that many users have even thought about the fact that researchers could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, a study in 2006, in which he explored the public pages of students on Facebook.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
"It was just them and their friends."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34">
Then there is the question of methodology.
</seg>
<seg id="35">
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
</seg>
<seg id="36">
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the claims in an user profile and in speeches.
</seg>
<seg id="37">
"What you on Facebook and what outside of Facebook, are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38">
Therefore thinks Selwyn despite his years as a technology researchers that are a Clipboard and a pencil is still the best research tools anyone can use.
</seg>
<seg id="39">
"There is no substitute for the real world and to talk to real people," he says.
</seg>
<seg id="40">
"Social research must address the social dimension - and plenty of social life is still offline."

For someone who is well known that he abhors detailed interviews, jobs are surprisingly busy explaining its technological philosophies and business strategies.

<seg id="11">
And incredibly pause.

</seg>
<seg id="20">
"During the years I always wonder," Why are you doing things? "and the answer you get is:" Oh, this is done. "

<seg id="21">
No one knows why he does what he does. Nobody in the business think really hard about things.

<seg id="22">
I have said.

<seg id="23">
Jobs will continue its efforts to streamline the accounting for Apple.

<seg id="24">
Amazed how costs were recorded - mostly began with "standard costs" on mere suspicion towards quantified and then with "deviation" he adapted - developed an automated factory, who ensured that the business costs could be determined.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
As has been veralbert the Pope:
</seg>
<seg id="26">
Jobs told of the "Blue Box ," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device, in the telephone company could lead slip and long-distance calls in vain.
</seg>
<seg id="27">
On the device was used a lot, but jobs enthusiasm, as he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the Box, by using a gebührenpflichtiges telephone, a phone call and then an AT to another, while durchschleifen they so many satellites as possible.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
"We sent about a dozen times around the globe, and if you go to the telephone, there was a minute later the telephone next door," told jobs.
</seg>
<seg id="30">
"We were young and we learned that we can build something yourself can monitor the trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a huge thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that without it they would be Apple.

<seg id="32">
Jobs told from a glorious stroke, the Wozniak and he almost withdrawn as they have in the middle of the night via the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk with the Pope, as well as they could nachmachten Henry Kissinger.

Because several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to telephone.

In the technology smitten (and unprepared Bill Hewlett):

"This has had a remarkable impact on me, it was the only company that I had seen in old age, and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it with his staff."
</seg>
<seg id="38">
Later, jobs was one of the HP employees, who visited the research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he "the first desktop computer that was ever produced ."

As improving innovation:
</seg>
<seg id="42">
Several times in the interview speaks about how to invent new products spontaneously.
</seg>
<seg id="43">
Early in his career, when he some circuit boards einbaute, he was asked by a customer, to assemble the entire computer.
</seg>
<seg id="44">
He was working with a payment period of 30 days and had to both the assembly and the extradition of the finished goods.
</seg>
<seg id="45">
Later Apple reminds him of the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse.
</seg>
<seg id="46">
"I remember, forceful arguments... You shouted at me, that it would take five years [in order to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I went out and found a manufacturer."
</seg>
<seg id="47">
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15. it was an incredible credible.

<seg id="48">
On large companies that remain:
</seg>
<seg id="49">
Long before he revive Apple, jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants with their visions in and lost control of their shares.
</seg>
<seg id="50">
"We say that you are working with IBM, Xerox, so make a better photocopying or printer, na?"
</seg>
<seg id="51">

Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of the health care legislation, as a court case
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
On the same day that the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the political teilende question whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama's health law, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the Office of the services that will take the case to Court.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
</seg>
<seg id="4">
One of the cases was a complaint made by 26 States against the far-reaching reform of the health system, adopted last year by Congress, a law that was among the conservative activists across the United States to a buzzword.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
The judges agreed with the hearing. Indeed expected in March, a 5 1/2 -hour bases discussion, probably the result of which will probably boost the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time of the court decision is known, will be in full swing.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
The lawyer, who will face and argue in court that is to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, a former Attorney-General under the administration of George w. Bush.

Clements services, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federal society, a veteran group that deals with the defense of conservative principles of law.

Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the Business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.

<p>
<seg id="13">
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years the Federal society.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
And that does not violate moral rules.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
In fact, the judges of the code of conduct that governs the actions of the lower federal courts.

If they were, they would fall under principle 4 (c) of the Code, which states: "a judge can participate in fundraising events near legislative and other organizations, with the judge no spokesman, the guest of honor or according to programme can be a host of such events."

Nevertheless, the extreme near Scalia and Thomas to two of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in this, morality and to alert government activists.

"The startling break with morality and the contrast with the code punishes the complaints of some judges lie, the court is the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the common cause-célèbre, a civil rights movement in the United States.

Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.

This is important, because it is less than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders, if oil prices rise, Dihora said.

Urgent warnings from the Pentagon possible cuts in the defence
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday, as he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security. That set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The Pentagon already rethinking cuts $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fear that further cuts $600 trillion or more necessary if Congress could not reach a conclusion in the spending.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
He said that a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation, would lead to a 23% across-the-board cuts and an end to a large number of new projects.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
"Such a large cut, carried out on such ill-considered manner, would make the most of our shipping and construction projects unfeasible - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts seriously," Panetta wrote to the senators.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
"We would also be forced to separate us involuntarily by a majority of civilian staff and that the reduction would be implemented as quickly as we would almost certainly civilians in order to achieve the objective."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and our alert seriously damage."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The cuts were in the combat troops, "said Panetta.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
"During the war time quotas in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect," Panetta warned the serious interference in the budget war efforts.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"Staff have been cut, leading to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war, would lead."
</seg>
<seg id="12">
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced to late payments to war time traders and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"The consequences of a seizure of the Defense Department would be a rapid decline of the United States as the leading military power in the world."
</seg>
<seg id="15">
"We are strongly against these draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when they Panettas letter published.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
"This is a result, we cannot live with, and it is certainly none that we should impose."
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United States and their commitment should not be allowed."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
Whether it will increase Panettas letter and the new warnings of the senators, the pressure on a compromise on the budget or will intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
Panetta has increasingly outspoken said the possible cuts, although he has many years experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he arrived at the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
At a press conference last week, the defense minister a gloomy picture of what could be a military - with skin, but without a core.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
"It is a ship without sailors."
</seg>
<seg id="22">
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"There is an air squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"It is an armed force, there is a lack of morality and alert and incapable of dealing with potential adversaries."
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"It can be a really angry."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks, delays in times of crises, conflicts and disasters, serious constraints on our global commitment and response capacity, leading to an unacceptable risk in future military operations."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28">
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects the deletion could fall victim, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning stage.
</seg>
<seg id="29">
To this list also includes the Fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Coastlines Ship and the new ground combat vehicle, Army and Navy need in order to replace the Humvee.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
It would stop the further development and testing of the F35, this would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say that it is an important next step toward rearmament, so that potential threats posed by China and other opponents can be averted.

"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," said the former EU Commissioner journalists.

Monti has not explicitly endorsed the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.

The "framework is now well established," he added.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is much less time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy fights against a political and financial crisis, which has driven up the cost of debt in an intolerable level.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
The new government, the former EU Commissioner Monti must adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by eurozone politicians, in order to restore the shattered confidence in Italy.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
The pressure to hurry on Monti, enhanced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years with 7% interest rates, with the state, which have forced Greece and Ireland to request the European rescue package.

We believe that this government is the last chance to make Italy emerges from this emergency.

Monti's chances of success by the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign as a result of the crisis on Saturday, expanded significantly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
"We believe that the efforts of the professor, Monti is to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
</seg>

The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of existing government of technocrats, Monti is just said.

</p>
<p>

Support from Parliament

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
The new government led by Monti needs a strong parliamentary support for the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.

A bailout of Italy with a public debt amounting to 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the EU's current rescue package.

Monti has said that his government until the next elections will be held, probably in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians will give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
</seg>
</p>

Monti said he would like to politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only consist of technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.

If we have two or three songs that we have played no longer, into the repertoire, we can protect our focus better and they surprise us, because they the reasons why we have taken these songs. Otherwise they could be it.

<p>
<seg id="78">
I do not believe that we all feel very attached to the word Grunge.
</seg>
<seg id="79">
When I think about it, the band, which I mentioned earlier, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others who, at the same time, if they are still important today, I think it is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands such as Mudhoney make better music now than ever before.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="80">
Initially, their music was dark, now it is positive.
</seg>
<seg id="81">
Why?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82">
This is interesting, because I believe that there are a couple of songs on the new album, which might seem somewhat lightly. But there are also other songs such as the End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, even though they have something positive.
</seg>
<seg id="83">
The two came to tears when I heard how Ed they played, they are very dark lyrics.
</seg>
<seg id="84">
I believe that if you are older and something drastic happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - influenced your artistic creation and your music and these two songs embody the clear for me.
</seg>
<seg id="85">
However, I also believe that a happy man and can put dark music.

Park or mountain?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The architects, in addition to the disputes about the fees with the tender.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
The urban tender on 16 doors opened the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In the mid-1980 s, at the height of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitan Bishop Ana de Barcelona (CMB), published this administration their Schmähschrift on the promotion of Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="5">
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
He was even in figures compared with the Central Park in New York.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in the eyes of many to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and bottom (Sea).
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The classification Collserolas as a natural park playing with this idea.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
As a model was no longer the Central Park, but yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of Yogibärs.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
So far as it was, as the city in September a giant tender, consisting of 16 competitions for further access gates after Collserola.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
No doubt a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
Either that, or someone at the gates to the country.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
The tender is not only from an organisational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city as a topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
It is almost a rekurrentes issue that two members of the old eingesessenen caste who meet in the elevator, can turn.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
And it is this fact provides the fuel for one of the rare common ground between what think three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the tender is appropriate.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
For Roldán "it is necessary," after the attack on the coast on the "frontline" in the mountains, "the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, on the green apples, were not held.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
"We should start from the principle that is the park overlooking the beach.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
Collserola is more complex, "judging the architect, for the title" gates of collserola "a" "is in itself: they must not" imagine than access to a park, but as a narrowing of areas where action must be taken. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Modol how Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as a "intellectual challenge ,"" some risks ."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
Risks as a result of the "uncertainty, which entails the creation of a public space today" after the experience from the 1980 s in the field of Forum had their "swan song ."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
The first fear is its own limits to what can be developed.
</seg>
<seg id="25">
"Something always means to determine the next step," i. e., to cross.
</seg>
<seg id="26">
"We must consider a new urban planning instruments, because the current [regarding the plan General Metropolitan Bishop Mariano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Modol, keeps close to the matter, says that the side of Collserola towards Valle Sana, "can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ," for purely topographical reasons.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the patronage de Collserola, not the "should fall on deaf ears ," although he was grateful that it has given his body, the possibility of this project" from the outset ."
</seg>
<seg id="29">
In addition, it says that the proximity of the city of escort letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he has expressed his "doubts" about whether this technical profile which launched multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, "he says," We should architects should only be a tool. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30">
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of the article is complex, because in the tendering conditions of Collserola lack a global vision: "there have been advertised 16 competitions in the sample," he says, "on the axis mountains. But there is no Längsschnittperspektive, considered the territory in its entirety."
</seg>
<seg id="31">
This has led at least in his case that he attends the 16 championships.
</seg>
<seg id="32">
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a gateway would clash with the architects of the Tors.
</seg>
<seg id="33">
In his opinion, should guarantee the city that is the Strip directly on the Ronda de Dalt in its whole length, which is a soft transition between city and green zones.

Asphalt from UNAM prevent potholes
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the School of Chemistry at the University of Mexican UNAM developed with Polymeren modified Asphalte to the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3">
Would the message emanating from the road surface, respected, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200 000 potholes, when the rainy season in Zona Metropolitan Bishop Ana del Valle de México (city area of the valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the School of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if it were the travel and the maintenance of Asphaltbelags, the number of potholes significantly reduced or avoided altogether.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
In his lecture "bumps from a technical point of view," he said on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory, for which he is responsible for developing with Polymeren modified Asphalte to produce a similar mix asphalt, but greater mechanical resistance in both high and low temperatures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5">
Mr García-Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified Asphalte in areas with extremely hot climate, for example, some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the surface and to avoid the appearance of blow holes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6">
He said that the asphalt - the hardest part of oil - a hydrocarbon link, which is part of a high molecular weight - the so-called Asphaltene - and the other part of the low - the so-called Malthene. Together they give the road surface typical zähelastisches behaviour.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
Zähelastisches behaviour of the Asphalts means that the high temperatures approaching 180 ° C behaves like a liquid, it is very viscosity at 120 ° C and 50 ° C, while he is in very low temperatures.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8">
"This is not the resilience of the Asphalts on the road uniform, but on a day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations ," the chemical engineer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The researchers said the FQ, the majority of the streets of Mexico City had a flexible road surface from six layers of material zusammensetze, of which the last three asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Between the upper classes is a layer of asphalt, from small asphalt gebadeten and then entrenched stones.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
Each piece this decay class, had been sweating in asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
If the vehicles themselves, and generating forces, this class is a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"If it were modified asphalt, would distribute the forces even better," said the chemical engineer.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14">
"On the decay class," he tells us, "is being interpreted a final class, the so-called Tragschicht, which consists of tiny stones, from sand, sweating in asphalt.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
Since this class in contact with the vehicle tyres, they need greater mechanical force than the wear-and-tear class and they must produce friction.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
The road surface receives most forces and distributed the Tragschicht also needs an appropriate thickness and material from which it is, must be maintained.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17">
The weather conditions, in particular, moisture and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, above all, the water, "he said," because it affects the behaviour of the decay class significantly.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
If the was wet, water in the class and only difficult. This caused a watering down of all sections of the surface and, consequently, the incidence of blow holes.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19">
If there is a pothole, "he said," will first of all the deck flattened class, while the decay class afterwards, but the damage was not immediately affected, but it is a process, at the first sign of proper maintenance programmes should be maintained. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Which is a member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores Nationales Research System (Mexico) said that the vehicle is another important reason for the incidence of blow holes, so must the thickness of each layer of the surface are always in relation to the vehicle, and it must be ensured that in order to frequent blow holes this regulation will be met.

With this night received result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico the crown and the cedar, has joined the Americas at 14 Miss title and Melina to the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had kept the crown almost.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7">
The big question facing many today is: What was missing?
</seg>
<seg id="8">
The decline because the result is a big favorite in any projection had shown that they had everything to the new Miss Colombia. It was not in vain, the Queen of the police and the Mejor sandbanks Jolie Vogue, who had also received the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and took the crown of Miss Colombia home.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9">
The first factor is seen as crucial for the jury's decision to appoint the first failure, is that the answer to the question "which book has influenced you the most and why?" by Martín Murillo Gómez Carreta litre Arias Leamos was not convinced.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
The young woman from Valle del Cauca the questioner replied:
</seg>
<seg id="11">
"I read a lot, I quite believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of more civilised, ultimately, I believe that the book that shaped my childhood," the Little Prince ', is a very deep.
</seg>
<seg id="12">
At the moment I read "crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal culture that we should read it. I just read a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian girl, a beautiful book, "passions'.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13">
A response that was met with skepticism, firstly because of "civilise" and, secondly, because they do not specifically how each of the book they had improperly.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina, to feel calm and happy with the outcome: "the universe is wise, it is what has to happen.
</seg>
<seg id="15">
And for all people: please read a little bit "The little Prince '. it is a great book.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16">
Among other things, that is out of love of El Valle.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the Priority measures that all Beifälle einheimste and received in advance all prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte costume and Reina Madre), "the other candidates jealously what stresste the Queen, who could not shine on the stage."

<p>
<seg id="18">
And that, in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and two lifts during the coronation ceremony.

<seg id="19">
Although she appeared safe, lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20">
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme "Como en casa" the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, "shows that the candidate who wins the most prices during the competition, not ultimately Queen '.
</seg>
<seg id="21">
It was at the end of the press - a mistake.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
Another hypothesis is that Valle Jurie could not convince regarding their interest in social work, which is the essence of the National beauty contest.
</seg>
<seg id="23">
There must be a reason that two days before the compilation of the international jury Lucy Doughty said they sought a woman who stood up to the social affairs of their country.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24">
"Beauty for Miss Colombia alone is not enough. We must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social sense, that they are already participating in the competition had worked on projects," she said.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25">
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, said her in the stomach area, had sinned, but this is controversial, because the jury chose it as a candidate for "natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26">
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán said, is that Melina did not have the best body that there were better, "but the problem with the fibrosis in the stomach, for me, honestly was hard to say, put their score on the last day."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27">
Meanwhile, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.
</seg>
<seg id="28">
"The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should get it right.

<seg id="29">
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "

<p>
<seg id="30">
Because of this prize, the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing suit a cruel prediction, which should be in the middle of the night. It was getuschelt that had been Raymundo Melina a consolation prize, they enjoy the crown.

Whether that is true or not, the fact is that Melina today their for a year, not as the Queen, but as a princess, a position that offers the opportunity to represent the appointment of the National beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.

<seg id="8">
As a prelude to the experts cite a recent poll by the independent society EIU, who had compared the death in 40 countries of the Erdballes.

But now there are, according to the experts who have inspected alike all those countries, whose approach euthanasia and assisted suicide legalized or decriminalized, no evidence that such decriminalization abuses in its application, would lead to the practice of euthanasia or begleitetem suicide unkompetenten or not consenting individuals.

Similarly, in its recommendation list that should be stated that the criminal law that the dumping of the funds, which have been a legal opposition, should not be regarded as criminal.

The panel of experts also requires that should be trained health care professionals in the duty to respect a possibility of funds at the end of life, and this without fear of prosecution.

There is a wide consensus on this issue between right and left.

The right-wing side was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who had declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including about 2 million immigrant workers, should be no problem for a country," from the left side by Michel Rocard, who had made 1990, France "could not accommodate all the poverty of the world."

This idea of immigration as a burden, an issue that can affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.

As the economist Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book in mind, the latest findings on the immigration (Exceptional People: How migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), a broad consensus exists among the specialists about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants to economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.

Limit immigration would weaken growth and labour market situation.

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that these threaten indigenous workers, especially the less qualified to replace, putting pressure on their wages.

However, experience shows that immigrants are more complementary than than the local wage workers, because they are jobs in sectors that are unausgelastet arbeitsplatztechnisch.

Why is the unemployment rate for disabled people to such a high level?
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.

<seg id="3">
Today marks the beginning of the 15th week of work for the disabled. "
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
Despite the purposeful Öffentlichkeitspolitik, which was introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people always twice the average average: 19% to 9% of the total population.

<seg id="5">
Discouraging?
</seg>
<seg id="6">
"No, stressed Éric Blanc Franchet, Director General of the Association of Adapt, the" week of work for disabled people ." "
</seg>
<seg id="7">
"The within fifteen years are considerable."
</seg>
<seg id="8">
"That was not the unemployment rate twice, but three times as high."
</seg>
<seg id="9">
"Nevertheless, there is still an enormous amount of work to do."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10">
It must be said, however, that for disabled unemployed are still many obstacles remain before they get a job.
</seg>
<seg id="11">
More often it is the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
</seg>
<seg id="12">
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them have no A-levels and there are only 10,000 people among the 2.3 million students with higher levels of educational attainment.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% in the overall average.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
In short, there are so many criteria that make a fresh start working, and the "form the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, the company is helping to recruit disabled workers.

</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18">
The result is that private companies with more than 20 people still have a long way to go to the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in an Act of 1987.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
The latter, which dates from 2008 figures point to a ratio of 2.6%.
</seg>
<seg id="20">
"We are now about 3%," said Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organisation, which is tasked to collect contributions from companies that flout the law.
</seg>

The proof: the number of "fees" zahlender plants, as well as the sum of the amounts paid between 2007 and 2011, and in number from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22">
"The 2005 law, which provides for increased contributions, created a strong pressure on the companies, said Pierre Blanc."
</seg>
<seg id="23">
"But this improvement is also a real awareness especially among the large firms groups."
</seg>
<seg id="24">
According to the Ministry of Labor employ only 59% of the plants between 20 and 49 staff disabled workers, businesses with 100 to 199 employees compared to 82%.

Portugal very confident
</seg>
<p>
<seg id="2">
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento provides for the return match against Bosnia with great optimism (22:00 p. m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
</seg>
<seg id="3">
The Hinspiel had two teams lacked objectivity.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4">
"At the end of this 90 minutes we will be a happy team and, above all a happy country."
</seg>
<seg id="5">
Paulo Bento already faces in Poland and Ukraine.
</seg>
<seg id="6">
For him, there is not even the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his National Eleven, for which he has since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
</seg>
<seg id="7">
For Portugal, in fact only 90 minutes sanctuary.
</seg>
<seg id="8">
But it is to play a match, abzuservieren and an opponent, and Bosnia.
</seg>
<seg id="9">
In view of the Hinspiels (0 - 0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems obvious that has not yet been decided.
</seg>
<seg id="10">
Portugal dominated the game clear about more than a hour, but the team was not able to put the matter as important as it would have taken up the pressure.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11">
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12">
At home, however, in their bright erstrahlenden Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese, before an audience that will be as much of the game to get by, even if the game, of course, as a "very close" was announced, said the optimistic, but lucid Bento.
</seg>
<seg id="13">
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
</seg>
<seg id="14">
"We have to continue to have a 50% chance in the championship in 2012," watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
</seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15">
The draw on Friday in Bosnia is forcing the Portuguese to achieve a goal and to win.
</seg>
<seg id="16">
A draw to the Bosnians, who also have a goal, already.
</seg>
<seg id="17">
"This is a good result, but it poses some risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor" regrets Bento.
</seg>
<seg id="18">
"We are up against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
</seg>
<seg id="19">
As in Zenica the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "admit they have no time for reflection."
</seg>
<seg id="20">
A good idea, provided that they will be implemented in practice.
