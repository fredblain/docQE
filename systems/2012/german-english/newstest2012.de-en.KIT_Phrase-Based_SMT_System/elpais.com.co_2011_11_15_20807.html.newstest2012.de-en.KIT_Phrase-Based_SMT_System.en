What was missing to the candidate del Valle, the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors which restraint that Melina Ramírez Serna, not the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives his 14th title failure.
Once again, Valle del Cauca was empty when the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina had Ramírez Serna content to stand on the winners podium, a silver crown and the bond that they, as a new Miss expels Colombia.
With the outcome of this night received in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, something, the Department is already entitled to 14 failures and Melina the legion of women from Valle del Cauca, the crown almost had kept in the hands of the proclaimed Misses: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Alvarez (1981), Rosemary Alzate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question many are asking is: what?
Because the result is in line with the decline of a great favorite in every demonstration had shown that they had received about everything, the new Miss Colombia to be not in vain, it was the queen of the police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue elected titles, including the beauty queens, Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and the crown of Miss Colombia home.
The first factor, which is regarded as crucial to the decision of the jury, to appoint the first failure, is that it has the answer to the question "what books you most and why?" She asked the Carreta litre Arias Leamos of Martín Murillo Gómez was not convinced.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
" I read a lot, I believe in the literature, I think it is a kind of civilizing, ultimately, I believe that the book for my childhood shaped hardest, ' The small prince ' is a very deep book.
At the moment I read ' guilt and atonement. " It is a book of universal culture, we should all read, I read a book by Irene Nemirovski a Russian girl, a beautiful book that says ' passions.
An answer to, firstly, because of the concept of ' civilised ' and, secondly, because she had not explained how each called her book influenced them.
But after the conclusion of the ceremony said Melina to feel calm and happy with the result, " the universe is wise, it is what needs to be done.
And for all people: please read a little bit of ' The small prince '; it is a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite out of El Valle.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that it was favouring the stresste all Beifälle reaps and in the run-up to all get prices (gastronomy competition Easter, public vote on the best handgeschneiderte suit and Reina Madre), "the other candidates possessive had made what the Queen, who is not on the stage to shine."
And it noted in its first presentation in a bathing suit on the beach, the Hilton Hotel and its two elevators in the coronation ceremony.
Although they were both safe, it lacked the strength and momentum, the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist of the programme " como en casa ' Channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss, " shows that the candidate wins during the competition, most prices eventually will not be queen. "
Moreover, Valle was at the end of the press from the road - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle cannot convince the Jurie regarding their interest in social work, what is the essence of the national beauty contest.
It will have a reason that two days before the international jury " Lucy Doughty said it sought a woman for the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia must look beyond the Körperliche and focus on the social perception that they are already participating in the competition had been involved in projects," she said.
There is also speculation that Valle with their defects of Derriere and fibrosis, she said in the stomach area had sinned, but this is contradictory, because it gave the jury as a candidate for natural beauty with a healthy body, good eating habits and good physical work.
The coach of the king, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that it was better, "but the problem with the fibrosis belly, for me, frankly, hard to say, their score on the last day."
Meanwhile, the journalist is Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believe the fault of the woman from Valle del Cauca were subjected to the surgery, which they had been.
" The operations are OK, but Valle did not know how they should make it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and they had to pay. "
Because of this prize, which will be the first time by the National beauty contest, after the appearance in a bathing costume cruel forecasting, which should be true in the night, it was getuschelt that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize, they do not benefit from the crown.
Regardless of whether that is true or not, it is a fact that Melina today their governing year, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position which provides the opportunity to appoint the national beauty contest Colombia in an international competitions.
However, it will be one of the queens, despite their overwhelming outburst for Cartagena escaped injury, was to go down in history.
