Sister of the Mexican president apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claimed that drug traffickers opponents Fausto Vallejo of the PRI have supported in the race for the governorships.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon has apparently lost their bid for the office of the governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results won Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, the race for the governorships in the western state.
"The intervention of the organised crime during the entire electoral processes and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after the election on Sunday.
"They threatened our candidate, our staff in the polls... you have built up polling booths occupied road blockades and instructed people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled for seven decades in Mexico, until the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo Claderon seems barely to have led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative Partido Acci√≥n Nacional PAN her brother refused to recognise Vallejo as victors.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRD, which is currently acting governor, came to three, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the capital city of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels, which specialises in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and Michoacan has chosen to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence still continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election, during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates have dropped out of fear for the local elections.
The PRI strengthens a victory party, no matter how vicious the elections in Michoacan.
The man, the PRI in the presidential race is likely to be represented, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated the Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think that this victory courageously look into the next year."
