"Cold and inhuman": unlike Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Unlike Behring Breivik, the man who runs two amok, which this summer in Norway, 77 people were killed, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "resistance" to fight.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a knight temple of Norway," he said before a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court, because you have received your mandate of organizations supporting the hate ideologies and multiculturalism."
"I recognise the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judges canceled Torkjel Nesheim Breivik during this monologue, because he wanted to give "Breivik, not the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to cohere Breivik, a pre-written speech permits at the end of the hearing to go to the families of his victims.
Nesheim also ordered that the police Breivik for another 12 weeks in custody, it will be four weeks, with no access to the media, he said that the authorities all visits and all correspondence about eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some were hoping to see Breivik's eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remains behind bars.
All were with the goal, that Wegschlie√üen.
"I thought he was cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was unpleasant, but for me it is a bit further, after I have seen and heard suspects."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and acted calmly and professionally throughout the hearing, and he looked journalists and survivors in the eye when he entered the building and left.
Despite Breiviks bizarre reference, he would be part of a larger "resistance" move, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not mentally ill and said that there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
There may be some that the attacks on 22 July, apparently, was the work of an individual extremists and not a group of radicals.
But this will make it easier to automatically senses the heartache and the confusion of a whole nation still?
"I wish he would look like a monster, but it does not," said the relatives of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
