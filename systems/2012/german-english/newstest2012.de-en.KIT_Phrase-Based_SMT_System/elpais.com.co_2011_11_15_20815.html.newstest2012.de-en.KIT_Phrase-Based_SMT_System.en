This was the work of the doctor, identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Lophoskopist went from Cali as the man "Alfonso Cano" identified in history.
The work of these officials, plays a key role.
On November 4, a Lophoskopist the investigative unit of the prosecutor (CTI) from Cali, as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), "Alfonso Cano" comparison of the fingerprints.
Of the seven Lophoskopisten in the department of CTI this week Eliazar Gonzalez on call, a man from Puerto Tejada of criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career worked González in communities of Chocó, where he had often for five days in the jungle to reach the place where the corpses, he should identify.
In 2000, he moved to Valle and after the completion of the necessary specialized courses on Lophoskopie is exposed to the investigation of the skin, the friction is obvious and Fußflächen.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano was Eliazar pointed out clothes for at least three days.
Great things expected of him.
He flew Friday night in the helicopters of Palmira after Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two corpses, and that was the suspicion that the man had the oldest guerrilla in the world, could be why he should take ten finger-printing sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he reached with the investigation, the place where the body was, he could not identify because of his physical appearance, because this resembled the pictures he had seen in the mass media, not in the slightest.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, no glasses and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass ink, compared Pflanzkelle and pocket torch Eliazar the fingerprints of the corpse with the fingerprinting.
He was right: it was, "Alfonso Cano."
The same night was originating from Puerto Tejada man responsible for the defense minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, to announce that it is the leader of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a Daktyloskopen from Sijín in Cali was appreciating the President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar Gonzalez at a press conference on the use of "Cano," very important.
Many people are not familiar with our work.
The Daktyloskopie is an exact science without error rate, which can be a key factor in the dissolution of a crime.
Lophoskopisten identify not only corpses, they also support an investigation into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of those arrested.
Many criminals in their arrest false identity papers or they do not have.
We are taking fingerprints and looking them in the database.
The researchers told us that he had to grab a theft of a piece of wall from a house, because the thief had aufgestützt exactly at this point, with his hand as he stuffed with jewelry and money herauszog Safe.
"The walls are difficult because their surface are unsuitable for fingerprints, but in this case, we were able to identify the imprint of the whole and the offender in several thefts took part," he remembered.
With the help of fingerprints murder suspects can also be exonerated or tainted.
Recently, one death, surrounded by bottles of spirits.
The investigation was suspected that a family member could be tatverdächtig and actually voted a fingerprint on the bottle.
Although that is not guaranteed that the murderer, he brought to the place where the crime was committed.
A Daktyloskopist of CTI declared that "the fingerprints taken from the object with chemical or physical reacto."
If they seem a Pflanzkelle or used for carriage.
The prints will be sent to Asif, that is the criminal database, or to Personenstandamt.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians are undocumented," said the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything is as it is portrayed in the TV series of SCI.
So all is not gold that glitters is not everything that treats a fingerprint.
But it can be used if an appropriate comparison.
