Leap in the dark
By Julia Stanek
Planschbecken in Ufo-optics, " bling pools in Budapest, who can travel through Europe, with a shock - and after a tour of cities or migration to rest the tired legs in Sprudelbädern.
A book shows where wellness in the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder in the past year and a half of research trip, was not lacking in their luggage: her bathing costume.
Rücklings on water, they looked into art shaped cupolas, they swam marble-Putten, the peripheral basins were waiting for them, and was amazed on meticulously restored from Jugendstilschwimmhallen.
She liked a bath, she took it in great haste, in her book notice - office knowledge values details about the design and history of the building.
More than 200 pools are finding architecture historian Meder in this way - and it is now in her published book "bathing pleasures": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus region near Frankfurt.
Thirteen countries by their "journey to the most extraordinary bathrooms in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a town in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real culture of bathing enthusiasts.
They do not have much in the hat with sports, says Meder - only in the water.
Annoying that swimming fans come with blue Kacheln and chlorine smell, while Jogger inhale the betörenden smell of Fichtenwäldern or happy Vogelgezwitscher listening in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools must always be ugly," says Meder living in Vienna.
"So I began to collect beautiful spas."
Surface water doubled architecture
The Wellness factor in bathrooms Geplätscher in leap basins and essential sauna oils - is so great, because all sense, so Meder.
And if the builders have been trouble swimming halls can be a real Augenschmaus: "instead of a floor in dipping water surface."
"It is transparent, but on the other hand, reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All doubles blend: high vaults, colorful Kacheln, boards leap.
The kleinformatige picture band gives "bathing pleasures" 190 pages on the value of knowledge about the historic architecture and cultural history of wellness-oases - but especially for a leap in the dark.
Remarkable specimens discovered the pool Meder collector with her research in Hungary.
Alongside magnificent medical spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi-Bad in Budapest was a nitrathaltiges waters in a urigen Karsthöhle (Höhlenbad in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a Thermalbad, whose basin filled with alkalihaltigem water in bottles shaped buildings (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular prospects, however, offer many free heated pools in Switzerland and Austria, while the Zurich Dachbad the entire city, you can see in the external pool of Bads in St Anton on the snow-covered Arlberg look - and, in Dampfbad, there is a window from the activities at the ski Piste.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design expects bathers in length of the field: the Aquadome Ötztal looks like a landed in the Alps Ufo.
Three dampft open nuts in the winter, while in the background, the mountains of the Ötztals excel in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder the smell of chlorine in the nose.
Many thermal spas smell after sulphur in the Árpád-bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba stinks to be so strong for fuel oil, which is difficult to believe in a Gesundheitsbad landed.
The smell comes from the hydrogenkarbonathaltigen alkali water cure, it is almost black and Schlick a stain on the skin, once you are sliding into the pool - a wellness-experience special article
In a place was Iris Meder in their search for beautiful bathing sites but also disappointed: they wanted to visit the free and the period of time in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a locked terrain.
From 1902 Dušan Jurkovic architects shaped bath has now been closed.
As Meder a glance through the verwitterten windows of the red-white-yellow youth-style building, she saw how weeds has grown between the tiles.
The decline has worked into a swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais spa in Wildbad bath.
Three construction schedules has discovered this bad already; you can't just neoromanische elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also a maurische hall in Alhambra-style, which was added around 1900.
Since 1995, thorough modernization is the Palais spa that Lieblingsbad the pool knowledge Meder iris - and not only because they originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It is quite an achievement to merge different Baustile at such a great unity," says Meder.
It is such a palace of the Tauchgang in spa pool only sideshow.
