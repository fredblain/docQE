The possibility of individual counting of ballots is not yet counted in this year's elections in Michoacán a reality, because the Programa de Resultados electrica oral Preliminares (PREP) issued data is the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections nearly 27 percent, with 879 votes, out of a total of 6074.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de Los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just adopted last November 9, the election of a series of regulations on the harmonisation of local rules with the reforms of the federal states in election matters.
It is worth remembering that Michoacán neither his political constitution nor his electoral law nor its law on the election of justice had adapted to the reforms adopted by Congress in this round of elections so that they were not entered into force, and the governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided their publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines with the argument to have any objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, and vice versa, the voice of the state to the constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal" because it did not have the right to "decide or veto it."

So under the following conditions contained in one or several election packages votes will be counted partial results in the protocols do not agree; the protocol on the counting of votes and berechnung is no files or it is not in possession of the chairman of the electoral commission or there are obvious errors or modifications in the protocols.
Moreover, the total count of fully busy ballot papers if there is a difference between the alleged winners and the second place, which is equal to or less than one percent is provided at the beginning of the session is an explicit request from the Party or coalition chairman, the second of the candidate.
The counting of votes can also be done in their entirety, if after the conclusion of the proper calculation that the difference between the alleged winners and candidates in the second, or less than one percent, provided it is an explicit request from a representative of the party, whose candidate has become the second, in this case, the election packages were exposed to a partial recount were excluded.
