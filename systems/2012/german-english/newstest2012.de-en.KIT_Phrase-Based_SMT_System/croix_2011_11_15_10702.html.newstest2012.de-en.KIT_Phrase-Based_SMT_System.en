Nord Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs at the bottom of the Baltic Sea and the western Europe connects directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Russia's Gazprom Gasriese wanted to celebrate this event with great pomp and ceremony.
More than 500 charged guests, including four heads of state and government have attended last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under Orchesterbeschallung and gourmet buffet the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, Russia and Germany directly below sea level.
The Angelika German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have jointly symbolic tax turned the valves, which Russian gas is transported into the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline to 27.5 billion cubic metres of additional Russian gas per year through an initial pipeline of 1224 km, which connects the region of St. Petersburg in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, will be delivered to Western Europe.
A second pipeline, which is a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - allowing completed at the end of 2012.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline hinted on themselves.
For Gazprom, the timely and accurate point completion of this enormous framework to provide as a victory.
The project was strongly contested in Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow a direct gas supply to Germany and avoid any track progress by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) in the country.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little bit of their power: it will now be more difficult for them to exert pressure on Russia by threatening to close down access to western European markets.
Warsaw, most involved in the debate was not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream pipeline with a new Franco-German sowietischen pact " in connection to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has won the endorsement of this Russian project, a higher security of supply.
It has, however, at the expense of enfeeblement of European energy, since the project was a rift between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has brought in barely five years, his vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, the strong Gasverbrauche and its gas reserves are running out.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us to organic way," François Fillon confirmed during the inauguration of the pipeline, he pointed out in the extent to which the major contracts are important political and economic side.
All of this explains the broad smile in Lubmin number of Gazprom's managers in terms of Gaszuleitung.
The construction of this pipeline is also a prominent technology.
The underwater pipeline consists of steel with concrete shelter they protect against ship berth.
It rests on the seabed, about 200 metres in depth.
Its construction had to be avoided from the Second World War previous minefields.
"Hundreds of mines, for example, had to be a precaution, removed or destroyed," Jens Müller, spokesman for the company Nord Stream.
In addition to enhanced measures will be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The management is a long queue of metal as 242 Eiffel towers over the entire length is interrupted by nothing: neither valves, maintenance stations.
A control platform was taken off the coast of Sweden, but the project leaders have refrained because Sweden were hardly eager to see a Russian state company in a permanent way to its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we close the Gasdurchlass in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
Escape in the event of a leak in the pipeline, so depressed gas into the air.
This case will probably be considered by the designers, however, because the proximity of sweat, estimated at a consistency from a leak per 100000 years.
The state surveillance of the pipeline will be guaranteed by an underwater-robot, controlled by a ship from external virtue purposes, as well as a device which circulates inside the pipeline.
It has the form of a cigar, a metre diameter, will be introduced into the pipeline and moved by the pressure.
After three full days of the movement by the leadership at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device when it arrives very specific information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years, without the slightest repairs need to be assessed.
The Gaszirkulation will simply pressure.
This 200 cash to the access, 100 cash to the exit.
Five companies have united their forces on the implementation of this project.
The senior leadership, however, remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies incorporated E. ON and BASF (to 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and French firms group GDF Suez (to 9%).
These five companies have formed a business community called Nord Stream and entrusted with the construction and operation of the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug in Switzerland, where the tax is particularly favourable.
Gazprom has this society hired out the entire capacity of its gas, and renewable 20-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the overall capacity, no matter how great the real transporting a quantity of gas," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the Gasfernleitungsbaus to 30% of shareholders and 70% covered by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
The total investment, for example, 240 million for GDF Suez.
The minority shareholders are, however, certainly, to recoup their expenses because Gazprom alone bears the risk of liability.
The pipeline is a sandy, pine-forested coastal strip in Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5-meter-high valves are Gasaustrittspforte.
Sensors to measure pressure, temperature and other indicators of arriving gas before this passed in the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal with a million cubic metres of Russian gas per hour pass.
At full capacity, it would be 3 million cubic metres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
