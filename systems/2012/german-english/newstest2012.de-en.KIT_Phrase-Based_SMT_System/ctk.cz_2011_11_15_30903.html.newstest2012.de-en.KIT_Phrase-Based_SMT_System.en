The main assembly should find a new chairman - a stalemate.
Almost five months for the Czech football has no chairman and that the successor will be aware of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), not even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Until now, there is still no agreement about what should be chosen electoral law.
And without that, there is no vote on the three potential successors.
Three interested parties want to manage the Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, came Hašek from his role, and he called on his colleagues in the departure had to agree to find a strong personality, which could pass the football in the future.
Only in the era after Hašek broke the old squabbles between the two chambers class again, unable to agree on a joint candidate.
That became clear on 16 September, should be selected as the new chairman.
The delegates of the main assembly were free of the People's House in Prague Smíchov quarter, because the trial led to no result and it was not just the election itself.
We could not agree on who is actually in the full collection is entitled to vote - only the statutory representatives or equipped with power officials.
In this single point reached at least partial agreement, including the recommendation of the Institute for the state and the law, which makes a representation on a full basis is not.
The disputes about the electoral law, however.
The executive committee also brought more clarity on the issue in meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary, in principle, nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views in relation to the election of a couple of times changed - the nerve centre remained the same.
The question is: what should we do in the third round, in order to avoid a stalemate?
"The sticking point is the question of whether we should act in line with the statutes, or whether a different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairman of the FAČR firmly in the management of the professional football.
According to a registered model prevails in the third round of the one candidate, the greater prozentuelle support in the chamber, for which he is standing.
Moravia is supposed to be ready to respond to the compromise that candidate win the higher number of votes from both chambers.
The Czech side is on the condition that the victor in this than in any other vote count at least a two-thirds majority.
"The two Vorrunden would make no sense, this mode, the whole concept bicameral," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side to choose the best, the electoral law cannot be bent, but under current statutes.
This is also true, surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík, even if that statutory legitimate election of all the candidates most likely to think Pelta.
"It is my wish that largely after the statute."
"No nonsensical concocted ersatz variants, such as at the last meeting," said the owner of football clubs Plzeň) Victoria, who is standing for the first time in his opinions, especially to Pelta demarcated.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his view, the new chairman in Nymburk be known, and he believes that the candidates work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championships today would certainly help to calm the emotions."
"If the football is on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate more," according to the official from Jablonec by all three Adepten brings the most experience on both a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but unfortunately, the situation is ambivalent."
" It is not a matter between the people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are some efforts to " zurechtzubiegen ' own purposes. "
"Therefore, it is not ruled out a new blockage in the main assembly."
"However, I hope that common sense prevails in the end," said Rajchl.
Just a lot of time left on the agreement by all sides.
Some negotiations should be completely allegedly directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether the football's generals until the qualification game at all.
The charter plane, which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl after Podgorice fly, on the morning in Prague because of a technical malfunction did not launch sought for a replacement option as part of the executive committee, but the venue of the Barrage-Hinspiels.
Ultimately, then, is the crucial meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the minister for education, youth and physical education would have liked to have moved the divided parties within the largest sports associations in the country to an agreement.
It is a lot at stake: state grants Vertrauungswürdigkeit Czech football and also the main assembly of the ČSTV the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka's new direction.
Paclík in the battle for the position of the chairman, because he sees no suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting would represent a strong candidate of the Czech Republic (FAČR) all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association, he would not allow the fight to this top position.
"If there would be a good candidate, then I would fight for him and for the election."
"But in the current situation, it is not managed to find a Adepten," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl, so it is to prevent the alleged favourites of the election, Pelta, arrived at the head of the FAČR.
Paclík also stressed that he plans to exercise if he wins the role of the chairman, only a year, until 2013, until the date of the extraordinary general meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would like to hear a top managers seen not involved in the football.
"I have personally spoken with a number of eligible people."
" Hard to believe that some said they were currently not identify with the Czech football.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most disturbing of all Paclík allegedly linking Pelta's influence with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to delegate votes at general meetings.
It is unacceptable for this reason that Pelta the position of the chairman, held for Paclík.
"His victory would einkonserviert today and in the Czech football, it is not at all."
"The support Berbr a clever Businessman, the doubly bad football," Paclík stressed.
Here he plays that Pelta's name some time ago in connection with phone taps on the investigation in a corruption affair, but from the Pelta unpunished.
"I do not know what the prestige of a victory by Pelta (tsch) should bring in football."
"And how would we stand in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík his previous statement, "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta chairman," but a little more calmly.
Paclík should win in Thursday's election, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Just thinks another candidate - Rajchl, Paclík before the General Assembly had supported in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first, I would go."
"He has great skills."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team."
"But I do not believe that he is able to lead the association as a manager."
"I have my nose in matters, which I understand nothing," said Paclík in September for publicity, that he was behind the recall of the referee Luďěk Macela Commission was at the helm, Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík claims that he felt the role of the association chairman.
And holding up his skills in the management of private firms since last summer, he is also head of Pilsen, celebrated with his support in May, the first triumph in the league.
"I have the power to do something to change in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal commissions, which resulted in sickening situations to degenerate," Paclík, no secret of his antipathy for example to the Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of its priorities he would strengthen relations between the FAČR and Czech Olympic Committee, which he would lobbyieren political leaders for more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"It is one of the key things, the new chairman should pay."
"If we play on the taxation of happiness, as the political parties, then I understand their reasoning, but they must also be clear where the money goes," he said.
His link to the Pilsner club Paclík is also not a handicap, although he stressed, the chairman of the FAČR must be "bipartisan."
Pelta, in turn, is linked to Jablonec, Rajchl with Dukla Prague.
"It is not ideal."
"I think it does not make much sense to transfer my shares Pilsner club hypocritical on a third-person return after one and a half years," said Paclík clear.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, ausschlössen a stalemate in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association promised to be one of the candidates for the chairman, Miroslav Pelta, he will be in the event of his choice for the FAČR gets new statutes in future disputes over the electoral law to exclude from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday negotiation in Nymburk and believes the campaign will ensure a success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had promised before the unrealised election in September, he wants to focus in the event of his election to the national team and the extraction of financial resources.
He decided at the last minute to take part in the election before the last general meeting and might help him the two-month break, to defend his ideas on the management of football and in a broader context.
"People are devoted to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman on Thursday is known at all levels."
" He feels that it is high time that the association is led by someone who believes the man is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but also for many years in Sparta and acted in the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to guide the Czech football.
He is convinced that responsible for today's problems with the election of the euphoria is at the time of Ivan Hašek.
" Unfortunately, were approved at the general meeting in June, which were not as full as it had all been adopted.
If they are not allowed to different interpretations, we have had a chair, " said Pelta.
He used the revision of the most important document of the citizens ' association as bait for the delegates.
"I should be chairman, then I take it personally, and I am willing to bear personal responsibility if it does not work."
"It is a matter of principle, without which he cannot be," said Pelta.
In addition, he is not trying to define his opponent.
He had already announced that he could imagine a cooperation with Jindřich Rajchl he recognizes his legal education, and he knows that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also Tomáš Paclík took no more, no dry thread to Pelta.
In football, he is more than a year and can already point to some successes. "
"His attacks were unworthy and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"Now doubt many of its true nature," addressed Pelta his opponent, faithful to his proclamations, which he has already expressed in September.
In his view, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, national team.
And this should be the flagship Czech football.
"I would also try to stop all affair - from the Bohemians to the echo of the corruption scandal last year."
"Then I would plunge negotiations with private and public sector in order to ensure sufficient financial resources for the whole of football," said the forty-six year-old candidate ČTK two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival at the tip of the Czech football will mean no personal cleansing.
"I would have to start with the labour content of all employees," he said in the direction of the Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably nervous.
Despite the dezeitigen katastrophischen scenarios, which accompany the main assembly, he believes that the delegates are not wasted on Thursday after Nymburk.
"If we really ought to be the only point of contention in the third round, then we will."
"Football needs credibility and he wins only if he has a new leader," Pelta two days before the potentially decisive day of his career officials optimistic.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR hard to work under him begins
When the deputy chairman of Jindřich Rajchl should be elected at the General Assembly on Thursday as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, which would allegedly spoiled many people in the club's whim.
Rajchl promises that we are working hard in the event of his election to begin.
He wants to introduce the system changes, and the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football fields.
He also promised to resolve the case of Bohemians to improve relations with UEFA and FIFA to bring more money into the football and to continue the work of the previous presiding Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I would like to dedicate the football as a whole."
Starting from the international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, professional football, football performance for the youth. "
"I am not saying that I want to do everything alone," said Rajchl in talks for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I would therefore like to distribute the powers in the executive committee, so that each member pays a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks, so that the football in each segment at a time. "
Moreover, many were delighted not to criticize because they, rather than just the work of others, now really ought to work hard, " he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement have taken into consideration, not to run again.
"I know that I am working 20 hours a day."
"But I must know that it makes sense that people are behind me, I am not constantly spokes and every step, I am in," he said as an explanation of why he hesitated.
"Many people have told me that I would not give up, because others do."
"It is confidence, we must not squander," he said.
He allegedly motivated him, to continue the work, which began under Hašek.
"We have a great deal of work done in two years, and now I am not just throw away."
"It has been launched processes only in a couple of years and I would hate to see that someone stopp," he said, and expresses its concern that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta elected, the situation in the days before Hašek could return.
"I believe in systematic approach, and that is something not Mirek Pelta."
"Behind him, above all, people would make football so that he would be only for exclusivity."
I think we can accuse some, but not that I would be biased. "
"I am trying to be objective."
"I want to football for everybody, because it all goes well, and not just the man," said Rajchl.
It also contradicts the claim that he was only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people claim to do the opposite, I really have the best possible result for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and Moravian, whose winners in each of the first league felt."
"It might not happen today, only three Moravian clubs play in the league, particularly for the young players in Moravia is a problem," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Tomáš Pilsner clubs Paclík has joined the battle for the role of the chairman, Rajchl dares not to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel a strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has been elected to its vice-chairman and now recognises that clear successes are behind me," Rajchl led to the saving of tens of millions of kronor on disadvantageous contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as a success.
On the other hand, it is partly the fault of the association, not in a single direction.
While Pelta, he says, "he was disqualified from the outset, the Czech football with greater confidence," he considers the second rivals - Paclík for a strong candidate, the football really have something to offer.
"Nobody can question in Pilsen in just one year has done an excellent job."
"He should be elected, he would probably things continue, Ivan Hašek has started and the personnel in the commissions he would obviously not change radically."
He would certainly not want altered just to suit in his favour, " Rajchl judging on his rivals.
