MSS announces a research protocol for the location of the gene for obesity in
Social Security Institution, Mexico's leading a research project for the location of the gene for obesity in children and young people, which will be supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Security Institution of Mexico) announced that it found a research project on the discovery of the gene for obesity in children and young people under the title " the genetics of obesity in childhood and youth, with the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (department for medical research, the focus of biochemistry at the clinic Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, declared that a multidisciplinary team, consisting of doctors, health workers, food specialists and social workers.
This team will be supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The public is invited to take part in the study interested parties can come to the sports venues of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where every Saturday from 8.00 a.m. tests with children and young people.
He stressed that the investigation at the sports ground of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state México) began at the sports ground of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state México) will continue since 8 October.
If the goal of 500-600 people inquiry is achieved, the study will be continued in the south of the main city district) on the sports ground of Independencia (and the Morelos (in the north of the city's main district).
He said that the aim of the study was the intermixing of factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and young people to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the world's Day of diabetes, he said that three thousand children and young people aged from six to 14 years, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents ' food-related questionnaires to fill.
You could also be questions about their physical activity and family illness history, risk factors, diabetes or renal insufficiency, to control.
He also led the inquiry, people called Saturdays (weight, size, Taillenumfang), controlled their blood pressure and blood values such as glucose levels, Triglyceride, Cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that the investigation would be carried out at the concern of health staff about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys showed that in less than six years, the proportion of obese boys 77% and girls with obesity 47% increase from 1999 and 2006, and the obesity has risen dramatically," the expert said of the IMSS.
He admitted that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of Mexico's population differences from other nations.
He admitted that a Mexicans (), on average, 65 percent of Indian-American, European, 30 per cent and 5 per cent of African descent, which is in the genes with diabetes and obesity-related.
More generally, he said, put the genetics of obesity in the inability to burn the surplus to energy (calories), stored in the form of fat.
The researchers said, would be a direct benefit to the research participants in a comprehensive study of the children, found in whether a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even the appearance of dark skin wrinkles in the back of the neck and Innenarm (Akanthosis) on the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes at the preliminary stage.
All of the information would be treated as confidential and in writing, doctors told the parents, the doctors say the parents of all the measurements and beat them with lifestyle changes, which are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López said that there are three fundamental factors, which are responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, the lack of movement in their daily lives, most of the time to spend the day in front of the television and to use the means of transport, rather than short routes to walk.
The high caloric intake, which means an increased consumption of gezuckerten drinks and Kohlenhydraten (Tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.), along with a high absorption of fat and protein and genetics, which will be analysed in this research project.
