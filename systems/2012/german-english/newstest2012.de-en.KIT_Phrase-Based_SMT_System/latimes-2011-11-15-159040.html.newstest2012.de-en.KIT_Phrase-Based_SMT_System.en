Boeing draws record orders of $18 trillion in country
Airline Emirates ordered 50 two-track aircraft from the Boeing 777, with an option on a further 20 aircraft.
In addition, Boeing sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It is really a rare news that a company commissioned more than 50 of its products.
But it is a big business, if the company's aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co. and the price lists for these 50 aircraft in a record amount of $18 trillion.
The contractor is equally unusual by Boeing: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast that was published on Monday, valuing the Chicago company that airlines from the Middle East 2520 aircraft over the next 20 years, with a value of $450 trillion.
Boeing announced at the weekend, its biggest contract ever for commercial aircraft, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two popular Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer was commissioned by the airline Emirates Dubai.
The airline has also announced Boeing at the Dubai 2011 aviation show, an option to buy 20 more planes, the entire price lists at $26 trillion.
On Monday, then ordered, according to Boeing, Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, fuel consumption and vastly improved passenger comfort.
The price lists for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"It is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Internal Dihora, stock market expert from Morningstar.
"The quality of this particular customer is very high."
Many airlines of the Middle East are in possession of the oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the aircraft is a rise in oil prices, which typically is damaging to the airlines, because this is one of their biggest cost items, not so harmful, because the country deserves a higher oil price.
This is important because it is less than other airlines tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, said Dihora.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
The appointment of Emirates confirmed Boeing's leading position in the market for aircraft and helps the Airbus SAS competitors in the dominant position with the A350.
Boeing's victory on the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the introduction of the largest A350, which directly competes with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the introduction, in order to gain more confidence after the customers demanded a higher interest burden and scope.
Boeing shares rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
