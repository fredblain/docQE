The bank scandal by Zürisee
The bizarre bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS was almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then has been reeling from one crisis to the next.
It is now a German.
So it was Axel Weber, certainly not.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank was known in July that he would be 2013, an almost equally spectacular new job: President of the Council of the Swiss large bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly praised Switzerland their beauty and UBS whether their newfound solidity and friendly comments about the future colleagues.
"UBS has managed the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be different.
A UBS trader in London had been gambling found all security systems of the bank and approximately 1.7 billion euros.
UBS-CEO Oswald Grübel, not only in Switzerland's vaunted bankers had to go.
The UBS board president since also - and everyone is asking: when is Axel Weber?
Already, it became known that Weber advised the bank from February 2012.
And the administrative presidency in May - not only in 2013, the bank said on Tuesday.
This will be hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, much more economics professor and central bankers, and would have had an apprenticeship period certainly needed.
At a stroke, he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just once again proved that they have long been the title of largest bank scandal of Europe ."
Because UBS is huge - until recently, it was the largest asset managers in the world - and on the other hand, has been reeling for years by a scandal in the next.
Nothing, it seems, the once-proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also savvy Swiss asset manager she had combined with ambitious targets: they also wanted to be in the investment banking is a very big number.
The UBS managed in 2007 with $1.6 trillion more money with significant customers than any other bank in the world.
And, on the other hand, it was as investment bank proceeded into the league of the world's largest banks.
This made impression.
The former banker and subsequent long-standing banking professor in Zurich, Hans Geiger told: "my students, I have the UBS always depicted as a model of good banking."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: how could I be wrong?"
He wrongly huge.
For the first time that something belonging went wrong in the UBS in 2007.
The middle of the year was surprising CEO Peter Wuffli, which was seen as highly intellectual and ingenious bankers.
A few months later, suspecting, why he was gone.
The investment division of the bank had been gambling found with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder, UBS announced a capital increase to the tune of 13 billion francs.
It was actually investors, but what about some until shortly before the gerümpft nose: a dark Asian sovereign wealth funds from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so quiet that not even his name.
But that was only the first blow.
It was worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions of losses, Board President Marcel Ospel, 2006, the second-best paid board of Switzerland came back.
In October 2008, followed by the disaster: UBS was given its bad investments in the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank of UBS bought problematic for tens of billions of securities, the Swiss Confederation was six billion francs for a compulsory convertible loan, they could be Miteigentümerin of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because they said how dramatic it is for a small country, if it accommodates large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet was the UBS in 2007, more than five times as large as the economic performance of Switzerland (see chart).
"We could not save the UBS," banking researcher Geiger says.
The first disaster of the second.
A few months later, the UBS surrendered in tax dispute with America and prepared to publish the data with significant customers, perhaps with the help of the bank taxes evaded.
They also agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars as repayment of unjustified profits from this business office criminal surcharge.
The UBS known more or less open to tax evasion.
At the same time, they lost something that has always been their capital was in competition for wealthy clients: an aura of secrecy.
After the scandal was the Swiss banking secrecy is no longer the same.
It was followed by the resignation of CEO and board president.
And the exodus of customers ' money.
The bank had lost in two key areas of business within a few months of their credibility: investment banking through the speculation and asset management assistance to tax evasion.
And it was a little calmer, just when it was thought the UBS will been gambling found it again, there is this unfortunate dealer history: an individual trader EUR 1.7 billion, before the bank notes that something is amiss.
And it seems to be: with the risk management in the investment banking work obviously still not.
"With the case Adoboli has found that the risk control, little has changed," says Martin Janssen, an economist and professor of finance at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial board of a major German bank is safe: "the problem is the UBS, that they will not risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of the caution with which the Swiss bankers taken a long time ago, the guardian of the great assets of the world: no great risks for safety for money - may also break the world beyond the Alpine republic.
The coffers of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of steadfast reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich, fits the stereotype of the upright Swiss private bank - it is just a little bit bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in Zurich station road, which leads from the main train station from directly to the Zürichsee, flanked by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
As jeweller Tiffany's place here between Swiss traditional shops as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
For centuries, the Swiss banks: from the National Bank on the palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks like Julius Bear.
The UBS reception hall enters through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are dressed marble, are thick leather armchairs, in addition to the bank's logo is a great sign for ' safe '.
The UBS knows what the customer: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank have both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but eventually supplanted - or betrayed, as the head of a small private Swiss bank.
His name, he would prefer not to read in the newspaper, finally, he, like all Swiss bankers, even with the two big banks do business.
The UBS is far too big, it will take place - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And if they have already adapted to the habits of the Anglo-Saxons."
Indeed, it was modified the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, UBS, its high profits and induced the debacle: no European financial institution has lost a lot of money in the sub-jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster has been visible on 15 October 2008.
"On that Wednesday, the coalition government of the small Siebenmillionenlandes the biggest bailout in the history of their nation," writes the author Hässig Lukas, in his book, "the UBS-crash."
Up to 68 billion francs, or roughly EUR 45 billion allocated to the politicians, the bankruptcy to save large bank.
How could this happen?
When you talk with Swiss bankers, so they can see the problem, especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, joined by two of the three major Swiss banks to a huge corporation.
There was a bank when the merger was too big for the small Swiss - and grew.
It helped that the two different precursor-supplemented banks UBS: a rich, but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and poorer, but more internationalized.
Suddenly the internationalised favourable investment bankers at a lot of money, they were able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007, the group's head of UBS, Marcel Ospel, the chairman of the board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, higher intellectual, modest, a lot of models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly man has worked from the bank lesson to the very top."
But Ospel was finally left to Wuffli.
And Wuffli have probably made a crucial mistake at the end: "he thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"It is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: frolic came before the fall.
UBS employees remember clearly the leadership meetings where company chief Wuffli the same purported slogan: Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They led the League Tables, " rankings, which documented the success of the banks of the time.
In the meantime, the UBS, according to the top.
Some steps were already succeeded.
In the foreign exchange business and equity trading, she played at the top.
Corporate advisers who have been charged, but a weakness: international business interest in the language of bankers ' Fixed-income, " there is a huge gap with the largest banks.
The UBS have gaps in US mortgage products.
In order to close this gap, UBS went into an adventure that almost cost the existence.
Hungry for growth, invested both the bank itself, as well as a liberating in their hedge funds in the US sub-prime assets.
It became a huge machine, packaged securities on American mortgage loans and reached - but also maintained risks.
Also, when other banks exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the US housing market was going up in flames, UBS has bought," says banking expert Geiger.
The euphoria is so deep.
A manager to go after the other, more difficult than the attempts to clean up than thought.
Posts in UBS were Schleudersitz and shaky until today.
Whoever leads the large bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, which lost all obvious business models.
Banks researchers Geiger has an idea: stop the investment banking, concentrating on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
So far, the bank will not (yet).
But the investment banking to shrink, so much is already clear.
On Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti to imagine his future strategy in the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only intended as a temporary solution, as the bank is surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has pushed through: he should lead the business of UBS, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants the investment bank to back in the mid-1990s.
He is cutting 3500 jobs.
But that is not enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
They want to earn money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber sure now.
Publicly, he says only that he and his wife, once an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
