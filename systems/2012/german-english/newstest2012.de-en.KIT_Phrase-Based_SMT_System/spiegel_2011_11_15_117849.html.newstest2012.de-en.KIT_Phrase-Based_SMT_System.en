21er house in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: the Austrian World Expo pavilion from Brussels in 1958, won prizes in Vienna museum was empty and descended.
Now, he will be re-opened as an exhibition.
If dreams of modern postwar architecture, clear forms, glass halls, courageous swings and new building materials, which are typical for the belief in the technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of Karl Schwanzer architects for the Brussels World Expo in 1958, a striking and famous example.
Tail pavilion at the Grand Prix d ' Architecture for his easy and pending operates steel-glass design.
The building is now a landmark contemporary architecture.
He made the architects know that Austria at the next World Expo pavilion built.
It was 1973, finally internationally famous with his legendary BMW Vierzylinderhaus plus sch체sselartigem side in Munich.
His planned as a temporary exhibition pavilion had converted one of the world exhibition at the Swiss garden at the Vienna S체dbahnhof, and in 1962, it opened a museum of the 20th century - the 1920s house it was called.
It was likely the building but neither physically and technically as a museum - no walls on the slopes of the art, not a good climate.
Nevertheless, it has been used for so long, until the contemporary art in Vienna, a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz converted the pavilion, he now says, "21er House" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art in the future.
Tuesday evening, the museum opened Belvedere, the house is the first exhibition - a stroke of luck in all respects.
Through the restart Agnes Husslein-Arco, in 2007, the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvedere.
Husslein-Arco, holders of art historian with considerable career in the youth as Eiskunstl채ufererin later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and a founding director of the Museum of modernity Salzburg, converting strongly among politicians and conservationists monument, they acquired public funds and private sponsors ' money and use.
Should contemporary art works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba issued by the eponymous foundation, there should be a cafe and a bookshop, and an office house had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
The implementation was Krischanitz the ideal occupation.
Not only because of its sensitive converted Joseph Olbrichs Secession in Vienna and expanded and won the competition, but because he has studied in Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion for him was an "incredibly important place" where he was "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the Ur-draft, and he knew the problems of the building, which is already in its transfer to Vienna and lost his Umnutzung of generosity and lightness.
The current renovation, there were far greater problems: the building was "a Energieschleuder," says Krischanitz.
The windows profiles of the glass facade have changed, enhanced fiber glass insulation and the glass roof replaced by special security glass.
Bridges cold steel makers have been strengthened or replaced, and asbestos-filled blankets have been refurbished.
Two -got room for the new use, a reduced light gap between house and road for Belichtung, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the easy Schwanzer pavilion.
The original external doors are removed, the house is in the old rotbraunen rust protection Farbton.
And the cinema is even exactly as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found, that is a good thing, and it is cheap and Denkmalschutzamt liked," says Krischanitz and highlights an abrasive ground in -.
Despite all the constraints, problems and improvements to the building is flexible and easy.
It is been difficult with the pavilion, " daherkam from Brussels, " said Krischanitz recently, a typical ' Drop-in-the-City history. "
So an architecture "always in the wrong place," and still wants to "create a real awareness."
In this case, the 21er house, however, is not entered in the wrong place, because it is an urban fluke: around the Swiss garden is just completely planned ' Central Station Quartier ' office and residential buildings.
And another fluke may still happen: the 21er households could get reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Tempor채re art hall, and we hear that it is negotiating with the city a neighbourly location within the Swiss garden.
