7 lessons of interviews with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown this week in a theatre
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, compared to some with Henry Ford and stressed the technology genius as a great modern inventors.
What Apple fans, but perhaps most revealing in the recently discovered Jobs interview, which this week dusted off special film displays on the major markets, is to understand how this creative head of business processes and procedures.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-styled Hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer eager to tinker diagram - a man who believed that many business leaders, " a disease of thought, " a really great idea accounts for 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craft art between a great idea and a great product. "
In 1995, developed Bob Cringely led the TV series " triumph of the specialist idiots ' on the departure of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs, in a rare, detailed talks.
At this point in time were relegated 10 years have passed since Jobs from Apple was, and he worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was on the broad adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of Cringleys interview was used in specialist idiots, he says that the Kopiervorlagen of interviews in the delivery.
After Jobs death discovered a full VHS-copy in the garage of the director.
This slightly edited footage forms the basis for the 68minütigen film "Steve Jobs: the lost interview" this Wednesday and Thursday in the country, Mark theatre.
For someone who is well known that he loathes detailed interviews, seems jobs surprisingly eager to explain its technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly pensive.
In the course of the interviews, it is four times longer breaks between the question and answer - Nachs 10-15 seconds, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and accuracy.
There are moments in which Jobs ' impact on days when he appears impatient to Cringelys issues and anschubst faster on issues or actions of greater significance.
Before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone that seems somehow incredibly far-sighted Verlorene interview if Jobs assesses what other companies in his opinion, right or wrong, and his own vision for the future of the computer.
It is one thing to see posthumous eulogies career jobs to read, but jobs here as the greedy dreamer, is poised to grandeur, is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had it all, he drew and made it.
A quick glance at seven remarkable sequences of Verlorenen interviews:
As he learned to run a business:
" During the years in the business, I ask: " why you do things? ' and the answer, you always get is, ' Oh, it is so easy. "
No one knows why he does what he is doing, no one thinks the business really carefully about things.
I have noticed that.
Jobs will lead to further his efforts to streamline the accounting at Apple.
Amazed costs were recorded - usually began with "standard costs" were estimated at a mere innocence and then adapted "deviation" - he developed an automated factory, which will be able to ensure that the business costs in minute.
The Pope was veralbert:
Jobs told of "the Blue Box," which he has built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which to creep into the telephone company and free long-distance calls.
The device has already been written, but jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of Selbstbemächtigung is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a chargeable phone, make a phone call and then by an AT & T network in another link, while so many satellites as possible by stacking.
"We sent matters of half a dozen times around the globe, and if we grölte phone, there was a minute later, next door in the phone," jobs told kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we can build something that trillions of dollars of infrastructure can control throughout the world."
Both of us, we did not know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can monitor a gigantic thing, it was an incredible lesson and I do not believe that it would be without Apple.
Jobs told from a glorious coup, Wozniak and he almost pulled out when they anriefen via Blue Box in the Vatican in the middle of the night and wanted to speak with the pope, while it so well, they were able to follow Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy in the middle of the night were called in to speak with the American diplomats, the two loslachen before the Pope even came to the telephone.
As he is in love with the technology (and unprepared, Bill Hewlett anrief):
In the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a spectrum meters, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute telephone call received jobs for the summer work part-time at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company that I had seen in age, and it shaped my views about what a company was and how well it treated his staff."
Later jobs, one of the HP workers visited the research laboratories of the company in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first Desktop computers ever produced."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with Braunscher tube and I love in him.
I would climb at HP as a teenager and depend on this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview speaks jobs about spontaneously inventing new products.
Early in his career when he incorporated some platinum, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment period of 30 days and had to think both the assembly processes as well as the extradition of the ready-made equipment.
He later Apple recalls the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... you shouted at me, that it would take five years to build a mouse, which would cost $300] and I stood up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse, we are building for $15, and this was incredibly credible.
Large companies keep:
Long before he left Apple, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrial giants in stumble with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"We say that you are working with IBM or Xerox, so you make a better photocopier or printer, so what?"
They have the monopoly shares, so the company is not successful.
Sales and marketing to make it successful, so [people], which is ultimately the company and the product, the people will be pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly by people who have no concept of extinct about good products versus bad products - crafts art.
It happened at Xerox...
Xerox would have the entire computer industry.
It would be ten times greater, the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
On innovation, as the art form:
"It is a lot of craft art between a great idea and a great product... if we develop this great idea, it is changing and growing."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
Votes must be certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
We must see 5000 cases, these concepts, and they all bring together...
Ultimately, it comes down to taste, what you do, it is that you try with the best stuff that people have created, and then trying these things to bring together.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shamelessly in stealing grand ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there, musicians, poets, artists, Zoologen were historians, who just happens to be the best computer scientists in the world.
It would not have been the computer industry, they would create fantastic things in other areas.
