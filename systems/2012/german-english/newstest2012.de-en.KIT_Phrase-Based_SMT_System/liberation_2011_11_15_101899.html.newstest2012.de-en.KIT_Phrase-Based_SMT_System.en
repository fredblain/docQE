Immigration is a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized for a variety of perspectives - congestion by police, judicial and administrative bodies because of the figures derived policy, this policy of reconciliation with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had itself.
Recently, the official side against foreign students targeted harassment of the weeks, the Interior Minister had in passing (see Libération announced on 23 May) that France "no talent, masons or waitresses needed from abroad."
But this policy was only rarely, from an economic point of view.
There is a wide consensus between left and right on this issue.
The tone of Jacques Chirac has been dented by right-wing side, in 1976, had declared that "900000 unemployed people, including more than 2 million immigrant workers, no problem for a country should be" left-wing side by Michel Rocard, in 1990, France "could not take the whole world poverty."
The only difference is the level of generosity
The fear of invasion of national land by hordes of Polish plumber was divided in 2005 by both the right and the left.
Both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is the extent to which the generosity, the immigrants are willing to admit.
Francois Hollande is limited in his programme banalities, pointing to a partnership venture development to solve our problems of migration. "
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, it may have an impact on the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As we remember the economic expert Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron in a recent book that the latest findings on the immigration brings together (Exceptional People: how migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), among the specialists, a broad consensus about the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth, wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would invalidate the growth and the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they are threatening to find substitutes for the local workforce, particularly the less skilled, they exerted pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are much complementary truth as the domestic wage workers, because they focus on careers in sectors that are technically unutilised workplace.
The low-skilled immigrants to work in sectors that little domestic wage workers poking the better work among the immigrants in dynamic sectors in which the training is not aligned with the labour supply.
Positive wage effect
As a surgeon would have difficulties to work in a country where there is a lack of Anästhesisten, this complementarity between locals and migrants have a positive effect of immigrants moving on wages and domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way, a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants, a wateringdown, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And without taking into account the fact that the high proportion of immigrants sponsored diversity of ideas creation and economic growth is conducive to (naturalised immigrants with American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants.
The migrants also net social systems in European countries, on average, in a level of 1% of the total budget.
The International Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that a migrating to Germany at the age of 30 years, the person the public budget, on average, about his life, a net contribution (revenue minus spending) of the EUR 150000.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to start his mandate, the lack of average points "with the teeth."
With these teeth, which should discourage immigrants, however, is exactly the opposite effect.
