Debt for construction work
In the Hábitat programmes Rescate de Espacios Públicos and social 3x1 planned buildings for migrants are in danger of not completed due to lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the urban authority for social development, said that although the building programme has already advanced, they are now in danger, because the government the money for the three programmes 11 million peso are not paid.
He said that the total investment in these three programmes that measured nearly 50 million peso, which fell 25 percent to the state until now only the Federación and community contributed to the construction funds to expect a delay in the Baubeendigung.
"They must contribute 12 million, and although the year comes to an end, they have given us a penny, even though they are already in July a part would have to pay," he said. "Not too late, we have already begun with the construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state has not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the local time, a loan of 7 million needed to borrow the equivalent to the amount that the central government would have to start by the government.
"That was already gone in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources, and the programs went further and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not to participate in these programmes," he said.
Even if the state authorities were committed to the disbursement of these funds, he commented that the minister for administration and finance, has been asked to speed up the administrative work and the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They must contribute nearly 12 million, and although the year comes to an end, they have given us a penny."
