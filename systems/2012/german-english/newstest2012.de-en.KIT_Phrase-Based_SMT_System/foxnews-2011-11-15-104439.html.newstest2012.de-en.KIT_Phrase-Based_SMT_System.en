Controversial plan for a pipeline will be reviewed after exposure to delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration has threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada into the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions and calmed environmentalists, is trying to build the pipeline companies to plan the project, so that we can go back to normal.
Trans-Canada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive area of Sand Hills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building by Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax trans-Canada, said that the company was still confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new course is to avoid the area of sand Hills in Nebraska and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a vast underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," said the Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska to Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered a decision may be postponed until 2013, after the elections in the coming year, although officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
The 1700-mile pipeline to Canada was to combine with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would pass through six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labour markets love them, because they appreciate the fact that the pipeline will create 20000 jobs.
But the legislators Nebraskas, who are opposed to the plan, weighing the laws in order to force a retreat from the region of the sand Hills and the Ogallala-Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on the impact on the environment of the Foreign Ministry has found out that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says that the principal investigator of the ministry has requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist, was stopped by trans-Canada, Paul Elliott, the 2008 adviser was Hillary Clinton, is mired in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company was ordered to carry out the original study was an inappropriate choice since they trans-Canada.
