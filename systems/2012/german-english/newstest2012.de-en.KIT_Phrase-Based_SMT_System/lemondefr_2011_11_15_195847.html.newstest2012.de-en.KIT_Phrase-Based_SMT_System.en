What represents the Krank fraud stories?
After the family aid UMP and the government to take the Krank in attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux, a family of aid coffers and a speech on the - since 2007, always recurrent - subject of the fight against social and economic dependence on the state.
In order to accompany this attack by the desire to undergo the economy in a tough test, but on the other hand, no less a harbinger of an axis of right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate workers sick.
First of all with economic budget targets: the government reshape the introduction of a fourth-day leave before a speech Krank workers in the private sector.
In plain English, this means that a sick workers without approval of the specific company wage would lose by four days, so at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure which, according to the newspaper, "les echoes" threatens to provoke anger, however, would help to 280 million euros.
The other measure with a rather symbolic nature accompanied: state officials unverg체teten waiting in the event of illness (so far, there is for them, Gegensatze three days waiting in the private sector, no waiting period).
While these issues in the debate, sparked by the majority of the fraud issue, this time on the abuse associated with labour shortage.
"Checks will be much more important and, moreover, they are r체ckzuverg체ten, if it is required," warned Xavier Betrand on Sunday, 13 November, before the microphone of the station RTL.
As in other cases, seem to the effects of this reporting about the reality of fraudulent activities in the areas of Krank reports a little disproportionate.
This is, in fact, since 2002, the subject of permanent observation and political offensive operations, the most frequently borne fruit.
The French are no longer ill more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
We dwell, however, the nationwide figures.
According to the country's health insurance fund CNAM more than EUR 237 million daily compensation paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of health care, the daily compensation with 11.3 billion euros, 5% of health expenditure in 2008.
Under this amount fell 46% on maternity leave and work-related accidents and illness leave on 54%, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And, therefore, 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, have been given to the French to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, on average, only 14.5 sick days.
Midway, covered up the differences: a different monster twitter.com, Web site for career planning, was published in 2007, showed that 75% of 40,000 claimed that French workers have taken a single hospital.
A different, this time covered by the health insurance study clarifies that 37% of the Krank reports of shorter duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% in 2010.
Compared with their European neighbours, the French workers tend to not more than elsewhere, to work.
A global shortage in 2010, by two researchers from the French state-owned Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) carried out long-term study showed that between 1994 and 2001, the fragmented rate (or otherwise) oszillierte in France between 10% and 11% to 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The Krank fraud reports represents a tiny share in terms of undeclared work.
Regarding the fraud is only a weak levels.
Encouraging the legislation since 2002, means that there is systmatische controls Krank reports exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college education and training of technicians and engineers) below 1.5 million checks found that 13% of the 285000 carried short-term Krank reports in 37050 cases "unjustified or too long."
The systematic controlled Krankmeldungsf채llen of more than 45 days was permanently under 1.2 million, 11% "aligned or unjustified" cases, which means 132000.
Overall, this makes so 169000 "unjustified" to several million workers who have a Krank notification.
A paragraph, only a weak number, for example, the undeclared work represents.
According to the UMP members Dominique Tian, author of a factual report published in July, is between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax profit loss per year, more than the total cost of daily expenses, and thus far more than the Defraudation in latter regarding this issue.
