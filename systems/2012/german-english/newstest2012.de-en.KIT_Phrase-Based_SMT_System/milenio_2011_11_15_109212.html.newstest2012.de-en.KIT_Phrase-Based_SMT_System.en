The designated prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy, to present the new government, the crisis of Italy to the brink of economic collapse has resulted in the face.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that on Sunday appointed Monti would meet on Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, in order to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a majority of technocrats compound cabinet, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would give the president the results of the talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to express my absolute confidence in our country's ability to deal with these difficult times," said the former commissioner of the journalists.
Monti confirmed not explicitly the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles are overcome.
"The framework is now well established," he added.
Monti has succeeded in less than three days to form a government, which is a lot less time than normal, while Italy is fighting against a political and financial crisis, which has been the cost of the debt in an intolerable level.
The new, led by former EU Commissioner Monti government needs to adopt a tough austerity package, which was requested by the euro, politicians, the battered confidence in Italy to regain.
The pressure to rush to Monti, reinforced by the volatile market situation, as a result of the Italian government bonds for 10 years, with 7 percent interest, which is where Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "we said we would support this government, after all."
We believe that this government is the last chance to bring Italy out of this emergency.
The Monti's chances of success have been substantially increased by the support of the party PDL Silvio Berlusconi on Saturday as a result of the crisis had to resign.
"We believe that the efforts of the professor Monti are destined to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because until now, many of its members against a majority of technocrats government, Monti is just.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs a strong parliamentary support to the implementation of the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Opposition to his efforts, or the delaying of the reforms could lead to a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of foreign banks and his reference, Monti's failure was a disaster, too.
Monti began on Monday with his debates with political parties, trade unions and employers ' associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
On Tuesday night, the session is to be completed.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano's response to the crisis, an extremely rapid change of government.
After a sigh of relief at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would have reached critical borders as a result of the uncertainty about the success of the new prime minister, the costs for the Italian government bonds.
A bailout of Italy with a public debt of EUR 1.8 trillion, would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government should be held until the next elections, expected in 2013, despite predictions that the politicians are going to give him time to implement the reforms, instead of the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should only technicians, a reference to their concerns about the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources indicate that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicates the involvement of people from political life.
