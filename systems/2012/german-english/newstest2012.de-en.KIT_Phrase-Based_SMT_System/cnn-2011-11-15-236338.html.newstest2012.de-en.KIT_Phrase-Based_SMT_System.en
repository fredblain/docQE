Urgent warnings from the Pentagon against possible cuts in the defence sector
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta inflamed Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would go unnoticed to weaken national security, so he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the chessboards in Afghanistan and civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon is already considering cuts to the tune of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts 600 trillion dollars or more will be needed if Congress can reach any conclusion in the spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the Republican Senators John McCain, of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a failure of Congress in reaching a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called confiscation would lead to 23% overall cuts, as well as a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a glib way would be impractical to make the most of our shipping and construction projects - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would be forced to separate us involuntarily from a large part of our civilian staff and, since the reduction would be implemented quickly, we would have to furlough almost certainly civilians, in order to achieve this objective."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were in the end, the combat troops, " said Panetta.
"During the war time contingents in the fight against terror are not directly affected by the seizure would adversely affect the serious intrusion into the basic budget war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Recruitment have been cut, which would lead to delays in the recruitment and hiring supervision, supporting the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be reduced, which leads to late payments to war-time traffickers and the legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators said Panetta 10 days ago and asked for further details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Ministry of Defence would be a rapid decline in the United States as the leading military power in the world."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon, when she published Panettas letter.
"This is a result that we can live with, and it is certainly not that we should impose."
"The seizure is a threat to national security interests of the United Statten and their commitment should not be allowed."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of senators to increase the pressure on a compromise in the budget will strengthen or demands will exclude the Pentagon cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has become increasingly outspoken, the possible cuts, although he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House, before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows that he faces tough choices.
At a press conference in last week's painting of the defence minister, a gloomy picture, which could face a military shell, but without the heart.
"It is a ship without sailors."
"It is a brigade without ammunition."
"It is an Air Force squadrons without sufficient trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers who are able to fulfil the mission," Panetta said in his opening speech at the Pentagon.
"It is a dispute, there is a lack of morality and alert, and is not in a position to take it up with potential opponents."
"They are really angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham Panetta introduced new details of how reductions "creates significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflicts and disasters, serious restrictions on our global deployment and response capacity, which leads to an unacceptable risk of future war operations."
And Panetta said that some of the deletion of the largest defense projects could fall victim, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early stage of planning.
This list also includes the fighter pilots F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new aircraft bombs, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new oral Litt Combat Ship and the new ground vehicle, the Army and Navy needed to replace the Humvee.
We would stop the further development and testing of the F35, it would in the next 10 years to save up to 80 billion dollars, but supporters say that it is an important next step in the buildup, so that the possible dangers averted by China and other opponents.
