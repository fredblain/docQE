Is the Enttarnen deceiving a serious knowledge, based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities, led by the far-reaching research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
As a result of research is that most of the old myths about the lies were exposed.
Look lies in the eye.
They stammeln falters, reddening and zappeln not always.
This, however, it is not close to identify and treat these liars.
A levelled Lügenenttarner can penetrate the truth, something about the structure of the assertion that the subtle facial expressions on issue and timing.
I have spent several years in order to examine the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of the Enttarnung, and it is clear that the Enttarnen a deception is a modern ability, it is easy to learn and helps us in their wrists in our complex world, especially if the suspensions or the questioning of people or negotiations or management are among the professional responsibilities.

It is a point of reference for the subsequent assessment of changes.
You are watching the attitude of the laughter, the voting quality of their experimental person.
They should know better, when someone usually are constantly with the foot, so that they are wrong to blame if it during meetings with the foot.

Deceptive individuals can also use a distance: "I have not had a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky," or if there is a vexed question repeated in its entirety.
The most frequent verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" if it is a vexed question: ..." in order to tell you the truth... as far as I know... in good faith."
The answer is more likely to perceive perplexed as objectively, which is often the alarm bells.
There is no magic remedy for Enttarnen lies, but you can learn skills, thanks to a Enttarnung is possible.
Thanks to these skills can be rare victims of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
