Scalia and Thomas dinieren with opponents of health laws, court accepts case
On the day of the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically share issue of whether a challenge to listen to the health care legislation, President Obama will gesponsort, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, at a dinner attended by the law firm that represented the case before the court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to a meeting to discuss the petitions for review.
One of the cases dealt with a complaint, the 26 states against the far-reaching reform of health care have decided last year by Congress, a law with conservative activists in the United States has become the buzzword.
The judges agreed with the hearing; in fact, it is expected in March, a 5 1/2-hour foundations discussion, presumably the result will probably be the presidential campaign in 2012, at the time the court decision will be in full swing.
The lawyer will stand trial and argue that to overturn the law, will probably be Paul Clement, Prosecutor General, under the administration of George W. Bush.
Clements firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Föderalistischen society, a veteran group of defending conservative principles of law.
Another company, which has sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenge the law.
Another was a sponsor of the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., the financially involved in the outcome of the process is enormous.
The dinner was held a few hours after the court had advised on the case, in a Washington hotel.
Service was among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the group of Republicans in the Senate and a fierce opponent of the health-care reform
The guests Dinners? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit for years events Föderalistischen society.
And that is not contrary to moral rules.
In fact, judges freed from the code of conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal courts.
They would probably fall under the principle 4c of the code, which states: "a judge can take part in fundraising events legislation soon and other organizations, with the judge, not a spokesperson, the guest of honor or according to programme a host of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme closeness of Scalia and Thomas to two with the fall-related firms and companies with a massive financial interest in this, morality and to alert government activists.
"The startling break with morality and contrary to the code belies the complaints of some judges lie, the court, the same rules apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the common cause, a civil rights movement in the United States.
"The judges won dinnierten during a Benefiziveranstaltung with lawyers with pending proceedings on the court."
Their appearance and their support of a fundraising effort to undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable for this event.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say that they would court to issue with groups from the agenda, as, for example, the mix Föderalistischen society.
And Thomas ' wife, Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
The Conservatives claim that it was Judge Elena Kagan, who have a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was general prosecutor under the Obama administration, when the first legal challenges in the first instance in court.
Their critics Kagan pushed itself to withdraw from the hearing of the case because of bias, because it is too much in the defence of the law, in order to be impartial.
Kagan is not about to do so.
