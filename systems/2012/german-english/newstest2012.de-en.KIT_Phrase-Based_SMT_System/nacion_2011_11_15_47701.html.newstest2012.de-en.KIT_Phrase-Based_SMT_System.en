"To play in Costa Rica is a dream to fruition"
In the exclusive interview with Viva says Bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam, the band is prepared to give in the national stadium, one of its best concerts next Sunday.
More than 20 years, they were expected, but the band assured that it is a dream, if they play in Costa Rica.
The Acting Bassist and Mitgründer group, Jeff Ament, Viva last week by Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20 years of existence, and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only freeze in Central America.
On this day, they come from 7.30 p.m. in the national stadium, along with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las rtas wardrobe from Costa Rica.
They read an excerpt from the conversation to find its full transcript in the online edition of La Nación.
For Costa Rica's fans realised a dream if Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: are you aware of what this means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream for us.
This is just the second time that we have been in South and Central America, and until now, it is great.
I am only on holiday in Costa Rica. It is a beautiful country, that we still have a few days to stay there.
It is exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you, because the fans of the band are completely. They see our utmost attention to the days before the concert.
What you are saying your enthusiastic fans?
Thank you, all these years to stand by our side.
We have almost 21 years until we came to Costa Rica, and I have waited so long and we 're sorry to have taken so long, until we got here.
Some people are of the opinion that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
This is not a little bit of pressure from your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we have made in the last 21 years, took place in the last two weeks.
We have played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo, and we hope that we fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really have the inclination to play there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are enthusiastic about the jungle for Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How do you know of Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friend is a surfer and I have a great friend who lives in Tamar Enhanced, where the waves are unimaginable.
My friends are always driven surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico are excellent places for surfing in this way, people who love the surfing, we have learned.
You have huge shows with many of the songs offered with an eye on the tour.
You have plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played, we also have no borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs, and we want to play a couple of songs from each album and provide a good and versatile repertoire of our fans.
It is never repeated your repertoire.
Why?
I believe this is partly because we play nine plates and more than 120 songs can play everyone likes a different song, so the decision, which we will not be easy.
If we have two or three songs that we no longer have to include in the repertoire, we will be better able to maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they have reasons to remember why these songs like they might otherwise be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think, therefore, for the audience.
With this tour celebrates your 20-year history.
If she looks back, it is difficult for you to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I believe that none of us has to play in a great rock band, and for over 20 years, which is like a dream.
We continue on this blessing, and it is great now to make music.
We may, and are delighted to bring music.
We are lucky to go to the places in the world, we have always wanted to visit again.
Things could not be better.
What it meant for you to have actively participated in the birth of Grunge?
It is always been an honour to be part of this group of large bands.
We are good friends with the people of Sound Guards, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and unusual, if a movement from a group of friends.
And there is a band from a city, but it is unusual, if at the same time, five or ten groups come from the same city.
We are proud and we are honoured to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we are still together.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and Sound Guards on their tour, and we are pleased to be still with all of them friends and we are honoured to be part of this emerged from Seattle-Sounds.
It is also very unusual for a band like the exporters with the same musicians together for a long time.
Yes, four of us play for 21 years and Mattisen (Cameron) met 13 years ago, to us, which is already a lot more time than many bands.
First of all, I believe that we are all happy to still be alive, and also we care for each other.
We are all close friend why musical paths have opened every individual freedom to experiment.
A familiar to the other and music could not be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy, on the other hand, it was thanks to your success always do what you wanted.
As she finds a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made it easier to find a balance.
We make sure not to be too often on tour, because it is too easy to this game with huge numbers of people who love your music.
Until you consider that the people who came for the music reminds you that you have the music and what it has not determined to be a famous rock star has in any case never interested.
What you have memories of your other Motherwell Love bone?
I think we have very good songs, and it was great to start.
We were given three years for a band until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods) never had a record out.
We were disappointed to have taken so long, and we are still well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore TD), with the band, a friend, when I hear a song or see photos, I think, what an incredible man Andy was and how he brought laughter, it was always a pleasure to go to work, to laugh together and to talk about music and football, and many other issues.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic bond desk rtas Las are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that she knows her work, in particular, Eddie Vedder, and that is why you have chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us Las videos by various groups and this band liked best, and so we are curious to see what rtas wardrobe can provide live, and this will certainly exciting.
Why does her text of Yellow Ledbetter, if you live?
This is an issue for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he is singing the first thing he can think of.
From whom you have got to be as influenced Bassist?
So many +
Among the first to me, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could all afternoon on the Bassisten, which I liked.
It has managed to Pearl Jam, to keep the Grunge alive, although it is not a fad?
I think we all feel very connected with the word Grunge.
If I think about it, the band, which I have mentioned, for example, Mudhoney Sound Guards nirvana and all the others that came up at the same time, if they are still important, I think that is great, because it is worthwhile to hear this music and bands like Mudhoney now make better music than ever before.
Initially, their music was dark, it is now more positive.
Why?
This is interesting, because I think there are a couple of songs on the new album which could counteract lightly, but there are also other songs such as The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive.
I came to two tears when I heard how Ed played, they are very dark songs.
I believe that if you are older and something traumatic happened in your life - for example, if you have a family or a friend loses - influenced your artistic creation and your music, and these two songs are clearly for me.
But I also believe that we can make a happy person and still dark music.
