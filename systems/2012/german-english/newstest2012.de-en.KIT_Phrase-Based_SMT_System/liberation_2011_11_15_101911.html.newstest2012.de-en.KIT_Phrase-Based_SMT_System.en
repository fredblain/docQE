Europe has invented democracy remains to European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset, there is also a delicate thing.
The European continent should be able to remind anyone who had their invention in Athens, more than two thousand years, the whole of the 20th century, the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but Franco in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the Supreme in Greece.
Some had believed, it will be enough to exercise the right to vote, and directly responsible as possible way democracy prevail over their enemies once and for all to see.
We know since Napoleon "small fry" that it was a feature of the spirit.
Universal suffrage is the necessary condition of democracy is not a sufficient condition and can be just as good "oppressive instrument," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organisation, separation of powers and control, training, education, economic and social community spirit, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, we find ourselves in is an economic crisis, but it is also very first and foremost policy and democracy crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek casual counterfeiting referendum would have had a double insightful character in this respect: the need for a full return of the policy, but on the other side of the disturbing sense of the impossibility of their Unangebracht.
This ambivalence should be seen as outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic fight today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain, in order to push for a successful national referendum, which organised the necessities and perverse sequence.
A free licence for the European dictator or a leap with blindfolds in the emptiness of the nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the nationals.
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, quite rightly, clear and steady, an election and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - you know, not more, where to put an end to the list - because there was only one crisis, and that there is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of the markets and the credit rating agencies, which under his impotence and his lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe, which is humiliated at international level.
It is concerned about the transfer of sovereignty in the direction of Europe - it is the whole of Europe, which is beginning to lose its sovereignty, and every one of the nations connected to him.
The urgency is to give the popular sovereignty, the leadership of the European project.
Because it is located on the whole, whether the Europeans to reduce the burden of their debts from the markets and looking at a future investment.
The exit from the crisis has taken decisions at the European level to condition without total democratic legitimacy without sure to lead to ruin.
This proposal by Jacques Delors and the socialists fought for a long time, is now pushing any European economic governance.
I agree.
But it would be without political integration and greater democracy, as citizens, to imagine a new folly and another impasse.
We need a new stage of European integration.
In the Republic of France, it took the Republicans to create '. "
The revolution's interests alone was not enough.
This instruction remains valid.
We need a better economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by a politically democratic Europe creates a true European popular sovereignty.
We need to create Europe.
