Fire story:
The innovator IBM enters into its second century of its existence
We are looking for a suitable word that the strategy of IBM most closely, then this would be the word ' longevity. "
For the general public, IBM is a synonym for technological revolution, it is known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The basis for the longevity of her first head - the visionary Thomas J. Watson, H.W.
He argued the slogan, countless worldwide problems could easily be solved if people would be willing to consider a bit.
His slogan: ' Think! " Has been a hallmark of the life of the future giants should happen (and, at the same time, the title of the company's internal magazine, when IBM issued in 1935).
This was also the basis of carefully prepared by Watsen business culture.
" For us, from IBM, this long-term thinking means a kontinuelle movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was also successful in a century, because it has remained true to its principles and not hesitates to change everything else around.
This has enabled us to transform in the course of our first-century technology, business and society.
We hope that we create, " said Samuel J. Palmisano, the director of the company to mark the anniversary in the next hundred years.
Thought-out system
Watson ran in the 1930s social care of its employees - in a similar way as entrepreneurs Baťa in Czechoslovakia: IBM people had to be one of the first American employees paid leave insurance through employers, plus elegant uniforms as working clothes and a reasonable salary system for best innovators and traders.
The long-term relationship of IBM are equally subtle with their customers.
The company was brilliant from the outset in the promotion of talent - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to pick and choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan, the Palmisan at the head of IBM in the next year will be swapped by a woman from Virginia Rometty.
It is 30 years at IBM, so far, the position of the head Vetriebs, marketing and strategy.
IBM in recent years, so-called online brainstorm about many future strategies and innovations.
There is no miracle ideas - it is enough, the company employs nearly half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakeable position in the business to guarantee the company a strong image, and that domestic and foreign.
"From the outset, IBM had the concept of an institution than a mere technology company," said The Economist, the professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company, the business to resolve problems through technology helps," added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
The company pointed out, there is a difference in the market, only to be present or directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logos for the family, "big Blue" has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the more competent technology companies - IBM hardware and software infrastructure, hosting and consultation services in an incredible product - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all the American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its staff were awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include, for example, bank machines, credit cards, financial swaps, bar code or the Diskette.
With around $220 billion stock market value (market capitalization), IBM was the second-largest technology company (after Apple), for the first time since 1996, Microsoft outdated this year.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations that met the tastes of customers today, unhappy with its own operating system, OS/2 were, for example, the online service Prodigy or the IBM PC computer jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so we must not emotional tie to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That is why IBM has no problem with his reason to build walls on different platforms - and if they do not work, they leave.
Microsoft, in contrast to the opponent, in principle, with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
To participate in the profits of IBM in the greatest degree of services, software and hardware to one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still more than most fünfzigprozentigem share.
Since 2000, IBM sold invested little profits for big assets with a value of $15 billion in the same time, however, it is $58 billion in shopping future technologies.
In these investment drives, IBM also continue after 2008, when the modern financial crisis for the first time as a storm swept over the world.
Here, too, IBM was the legacy of his first bosses loyal to Thomas J. Watson, in the midst of the Great Depression, increased its investment.
So far, it appears that the company IBM today's crisis emerges unscathed.
The value of IBM shares rose suddenly since 2008, missiles by 120 percent and profit of the company kontinuell grows.
The company's slogan is IBM: everything can change - not just the values.
Therefore, it is to be expected that this flexible giant pulls the next crisis.
IBM history: space flights from cheese Schneider
The one hundred years ago, society founded in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated names - computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM took until 1924 - it was originally a brand name for a plant in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for subsequent IBM society, the merger of four companies, whose history in the 1980s of the 19th century.
They owned technologies such as the famous Stechkartenuhren registration of work begins and ends.
The architects of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, until 1930, the chair of the board.
And it was Flint, the head of the competition, the company stopped Thomas J. Watson, so that helped him in the management of the company.
This Leader was the founder of IBM in the shade - Watson's ideas based until today, the invincible culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM began, as the name betrays the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machinery for the trade of sausages and cheese tailors to cash.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled their sales to $9 million and the company expanded, and on all continents.
Watson was so essential to the company that he was all for forty years in the head, then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson junior.
Under whose stewardship IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first Programmiersprache.
In the 1960s helped technicians and computer from IBM, NASA to launch flights into space - Mercury and Saturn, and the famous flight of people to the moon in 1969.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the number of IBM System/360 in 1964.
A classic PC, the computer-certain standards of the time, came in 1981 under the IBM 5150 names on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the other hand, they bought the Konsultanten part of the company, PricewaterhouseCoopers and rose entirely in the business with Consulting benefits and services with high added value.
The strategy, IBM is paying off in the last three years, the concept of ' Smarter Planet. "
It embodies the intention to use technologies intelligent in hitherto not planned areas, for example, to improve the situation in transport and urban management.
In the commercial sector, IBM recently led the dealers to help the entire commercial cycle to guide the platform ' Smarter commerce. "
IBM is also in the Czech Republic, a strong story.
Already, in 1932, IBM founded a branch in the former Czechoslovakia - even the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR, among other things, it is also a strategic outsourcing Center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe, devolve in Prague and is also a top team of researchers from world-class that deals with the technology of voting identification.
