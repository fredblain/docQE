Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team by Paulo Bento looks with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22: 00) in Lisbon on Tuesday.
The Hinspiel had both teams lacked objectivity.
"We will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country at the end of the 90 minutes."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt, "la Selecçao" his Nationalelf, for which he was responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the European Championship in 2012.
This is, in fact, only 90 minutes of honeymoon for Portugal.
But there is a match to play, and abzuservieren an opponent, and Bosnia.
In view of the Hinspiels (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems clear that the die has not yet been taken.
Portugal dominated for more than an hour of the game, but the team was not able to cause such important mark on the pressure from her.
"It is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor."
At home, however, in their bright shine Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced before an audience, which is likely to be hot on the game through, even if the game, of course, as a "very short, it was announced," said the optimistic, however, lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but they are completely convinced, to be able to gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of Euro 2012 to be" watered down, however, the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia, forcing the Portuguese, and a gateway to win.
A draw the Bosnians, who also needed a goal already.
"It is a good result, but it carries a certain risk, because we have made no Auswärtstor" Bento.
"We will compete against a team that has the high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese, already beginning to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians, "they admit no time for reflection."
A good idea, provided that they will put into practice.
