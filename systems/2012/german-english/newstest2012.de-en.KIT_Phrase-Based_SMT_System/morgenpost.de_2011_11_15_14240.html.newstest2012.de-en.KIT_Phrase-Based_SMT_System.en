Smart crow in cities
In many places, apply Saatkrähen: from the cities, the highly intelligent animals no longer drive, say experts, as a "problem of birds."
One, they want to quickly get rid of the other: belong to crow for centuries on the city, but in many municipalities, residents are mounting complaints about dirt and noise of the animals.
It is a tool against the problem of birds, " not yet in sight.
Saatkrähen were not out of the cities, said experts at the first Krähensymposium in ostfriesischen empty.
There consulted experts from across the federal territory on possible ways.
They are looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists led the problems in towns and cities on the exodus of overprotected Saatkrähen: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroyed the traditional habitats.
The hunt, increased building and typical nesting trees made the birds.
Crow are under the protection of nature.
Large colonies, with more than 600 couples nesting there, among other things in the Westphalian Soest, in the north-west, among other things, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen and empty.
There was a controversial project in 2005, the mass killing of crow in the district for negative-headlines.
Critics had called the trapping of the animals in the birds and the Erschlagen with cudgels as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the Vergrämen brings nothing," the city and landscape designers Werner Klöver has found from empty.
Wegspritzen nests with water or trees, often have undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are soft, large colonies divide and spread to other areas."
Vergrämung only as an exception to hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, they are not getting more."
Without the periphery is not solve the problem in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang waiter from empty.
It could be a combination of Vergrämen animals from sensitive residential areas and tempting offers to resettle elsewhere.
' Info panels instead of canvassing chain saws, " the psychologist and Ethnologin Uta Maria Jürgens for an entirely different way of dealing with the animals, " Pickel in the face, we can tolerate the best self-confidence. "
Jürgens had founded in Schleswig-Holstein, the ash Berger crow-teaching path, notices about the lives of the highly intelligent Saatkrähen.
The project will now have already adopted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise of birds Jürgens had its own opinion: "there is a lot of communication, which have much to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Saatkrähen use not only tools in order to get a biscuit, but as a tool of their tool even themselves.
Behavioral researchers at Cambridge University recently tested four Saatkrähen, how far does the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment learned quickly the birds that they need to get with a structure to collapse in order to reach a Mottenlarve.
Without much training, they have pursued what size and shape of a stone to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt to solve the smart crow a trickier problem.
In a vertical set Zylinder had the researchers placed a small Eimerchen with a Mottenlarve.
With the beaked birds were unable to reach their prey.
However, the researchers had them pieces of wire.
It formed a catch, then Eimerchen on grip from the phial of angling all four animals.
Three of the four Saatkrähen managed even straightaway.
