Development of the travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five in the then ČSSR approved state travel agents: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agents then sold mainly only travel in the socialist bloc countries in the West were only exclusivity.
And Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea in the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi, on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea, after Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea, and an end to Hungary.
A silver exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when they travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia proposed a pro-Western course and were severely restricted travel to Yugoslavia.
It was a great paradox of socialist times that it is not even citizens of the Soviet bloc (including the Tschechoslowaken) has been allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If a citizen of the ČSSR individually to Poland, for example, or even wanted to travel to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise were individual travel impossible.
Even then, the travel agents also had to travel to the West, but then you take huge queues in purchasing or spend sleeping bags before the travel office, or at least "good friend" in the travel office.
So the matter was still a long way.
The so-called foreign exchange commitment - the condition for an exit in the West - has only been "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel.
Czechoslovakia's currency was not freely exchangeable currency without foreign commitment, it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The long journey most Czechs therefore spent their holidays at home, it is no wonder that the Czechs countless weekend bought homes and dachas - a habit that has lasted until today.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a trip revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
During a holiday until 1989 in the GDR or in Bulgaria, the measure of all things, the Czechs spent last year, 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries throughout the world.
A huge paradox, today is not aware of the fact that it is able to travel to the currently popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, not at all, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
From the beginning of the 1990s in the last century, the foreign exchange requirement lifted in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, a huge wave of short visit, especially after Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Tschechoslowaken were able to get enough for a long time to travel to the West, not everyone wanted to be at least a couple of days.
The Czech slept holidaymakers travelling to Paris in the tent in the park, because who would have had at the time the money for a shelter in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical feature of foreign travel by Czechs was a vollgepackter boot with canned beer and permanent sausages, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of free umtauschbaren Czech crown after decades of our tourists were finally free to buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average salaries, which in 1997 led another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel began to travel agents regularly after 1997 to prepare for travel by charter flights, the air travel, thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts, compared to the past subsidized unbelievable.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the United States, already devisenlosen payments with all advanced countries in the world, what travel easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of the "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight was processed in an exotic country - Thailand.
Since then, each year to fly direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers in distant sunny countries; this year it flies directly from the Czech Republic, twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 Tsd. Czechs travel every year in exotic countries!
Another important moment in the era of our "post-revolutionary" marked development in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States join the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country under the advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent the first time, more than half their holiday abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in its history for a single holiday residence, including the cost of the holiday destination, more than 15 Tsd. CZK per capita.
