No liberating novella for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian Parliament refused the request, in the context of a revision of the Penal Code to eliminate those paragraphs, the opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was sentenced on the basis.
The new rules, which could have been the way for the release of the detained Expremierministerin can pave the MEPs rejected at the second reading of the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes.
Timoshenko was sentenced in October because of the conclusion of a supposedly negative treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas to seven years in prison.
The verdict is not yet to be negotiated, in December, the appeal of those convicted in court.
Timoshenko even described the verdict as a political revenge by the regime, and also in the West, the process of the suspicion of bias of the court.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of the Expremierministerin has been condemned from the penal code, was supported by 147 members.
226 votes would have been required to its adoption.
