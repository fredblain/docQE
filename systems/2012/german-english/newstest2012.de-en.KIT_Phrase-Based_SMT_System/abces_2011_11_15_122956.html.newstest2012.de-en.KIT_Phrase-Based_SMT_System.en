With the risk premiums pushed in the peripheral countries and insecurity among disruptive Greece strays in the labyrinth, from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more of a response to pressure from Brussels as a genuine conviction of political forces, slowly by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to the structural reforms and the agreed at the time of his appointment a hundred days may be too short for their implementation, assured the leader of the Conservative Party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, that he will take the new austerity measures to support and not his call for new elections on the planned date of 19 February.
