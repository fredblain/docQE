At a press conference, said Dionisio Perez Jácome, secretary for communications and transportation, that the pilot had confirmed before the start, the weather conditions are suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the Propellerflügel in 25 metres had contact with trees, and the helicopter lost the hulls, seems to indicate that the helicopter had several ground contacts."
He also said that the helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the conditions for the transportation of personnel.
He also said that the investigations in the area where the plane came down was no helicopter parts were found.
" In the search were no plane parts found in other areas, the surcharge was the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 inmates, which is why he met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a Schrägung from 7 to 30 degrees.
It is currently a priority to get the results as soon as possible, but this could be several months, perhaps even a year.
For its part, assured Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for aircraft and emergency services in Mexico) that the helicopter by the Estado Mayor Presidencial flown the surcharge with Reisefluggeschwindigkeit and the plane had fallen to a soft Abhang.
"This information strengthens the assumption that at the time of the collision was a normal flight operation."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome six relevant points, which should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the standards, it was a flight to the rules of flight, which means that the team during the flight and on the ground have had sufficient perspective.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start of flying in the direction of the border area between Mexico City and Mexico state withdrew some low-hanging clouds.
Elected routes:
It is possible that the team because of the clouds of a lower area with a better view, selected in the direction of the Cuernavaca valley.
Impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording the helicopter agree perhaps it has been a deviation from the flight route before the impact of either a loss of control over the plane.
Verstreuung the remnants of the plane in a limited area:
The information available to date suggests that the helicopter was aufgeprallt from the other and lateral direction.
The pattern of dispersed plane debris suggest that the helicopter with his aufgeprallt intact structure on the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remnants of the aircraft offer on the scene of an accident either fire close to the explosion.
The latest findings indicate several ground contacts.
In the on-site investigations were found aircraft parts of 9200 feet above sea level; the terrain is slope and a Schrägung from seven to 30 degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to break.
Some information suggests that the helicopter could have several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area on the abgesperrten area was the scene of an accident, could not be found scattered aircraft parts, with the assumption that caring for the aircraft structure against the ground.
