Parking or mountain?
The architects are apart from the bickering over the fees with the tender.
The urban tender on the 16 gates opened the debate about the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, the peak of the now vanished Spanish Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB) published its Schmähschrift this administration on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in the city of Barcelona.
He has even been compared in figures with the Central Park in New York.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park in many people's eyes to the ceiling of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia is one of the few not spreading in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification Collserolas plays as a natural park with this idea.
Served as an example not of Central Park, but Yellow Stone with wild boar in the role of the Yogibärs.
So far, it was the city in September, a tender giant, consisting of 16 competitions for further access doors Collserola.
Undoubtedly a gateway refers to the concept of the parks.
Either that, or somebody has to make gates to the country.
The question is: Collserola, parking or mountain?
The tender is not only from the organizational point of view, but also in terms of a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a rekurrentes issue at the meeting, two members of the old eingesessenen caste in the elevator.
It is precisely this fact offers a rare agreement between the three architects from Barcelona, and some university professors who have applied to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: tender is appropriate.
It is necessary for Roldán ' " after the attack on the coast on the " front on mountains " to discuss the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has been on the green apples, not fought.
" It should be based on the principle that the greatest mainly park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is a good thing.
Collserola is more complex, " judging by the architect for the title ' gates of Collserola ' " lexikalische trap ": they must not " as access to a park, but as a containment of areas where action must be taken. "
Modol as Roldán and Bayona with urban experience, viewed the proposal as an "intellectual challenge," the "dangers."
Risks as a result of the " uncertainty, nowadays, the creation of a public space with " after the experience of the 1980s, which had been in the area of the forum, their swan song. "
The first fear is its own limits on what can be developed.
"Limit always means to determine the next step," it says.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the plan, General Metropolitano (PGM) can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, closer to the issue, simplifies the Collserola side in the direction of Valle sana, " can be understood as a park, not in the direction of Barcelona ', and for purely topographic reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not fall on deaf ears, " though he was the city administration, grateful that his body has been given the opportunity to participate in this project, " from the first moment. "
Moreover, he notes that the Area near the town of escort letter, which allows the architects, to participate in the debate, even though he was giving his " doubt " whether this technical profile, which created multidisciplinary teams (" exactly the right thing, " he says), ' we architects should be a tool. "
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question of complex in the title of the article was tendered in the tender conditions, a global view of Collserola lacks: "there have been 16 contests in the sample," he says, "on the axis of mountains sea, but there is no Längsschnittperspektive, which considers the territory in its entirety."
He has, at least in his case that the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the programme and the definition of a project for a goal with the architects of the Tors clash.
In his view, the city should guarantee that the Strip directly via the Ronda de Dalt equipped in all its length is a soft transition between town and green zones.
