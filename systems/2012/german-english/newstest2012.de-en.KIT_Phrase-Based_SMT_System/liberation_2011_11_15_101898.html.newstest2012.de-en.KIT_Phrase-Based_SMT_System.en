Energy policy:
The facts should prevail over dogma
There is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, so this is certainly the energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly in the purchasing power and the competitiveness of the company.
It is reasonable to take a choice for a reason to reflect on this issue and the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if they explored all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should sound their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although 7 billion people on this planet, the demographic evolution, a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, should not have a huge share of the world's population on a vital element.
At the same time, we must mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to consistently produce electricity without the pressing need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue disappeared from the environmental debate, to forget in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident changed any of these parameters.
Therefore, blebt Germany remains isolated in his decision to abandon nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which imposes its decision, the need to find a replacement capable replacement source in Switzerland, which barely intends only to build nuclear power plants in the past generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few states to pursue their projects against it with determination.
The United States have decided after Fukushima, to rejoin her park another unit, set aside after the nuclear accident plant Three Mile Island again in operation.
Even if it focused on renewable energy sources, occasionally German model is portrayed as a model, but the reality of the discourse.
The election in Berlin, in the form of an increase in the price of electricity prices, enhanced by the increased use of Importgas especially energy dependence on Russia, a rise caused by gas and coal-fired power stations in CO2 emissions.
These unpleasant effects will already be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark is cause for reflection.
Denmark is a European leader tables in terms of wind energy, 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the biggest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; because of its CO2 Ausstösse and electricity prices by 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay higher electricity bills, in contrast to our French households by 40%.
As the price of energy in the globalised economy, a key part of the ability to compete and a deposit of stability to the industry at national soil, the French company due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction on the nuclear power would be a strong increase in the price of energy, which liesse the noble statements about the re-industrialisation of our country and defending the purchasing power of the illusion.
Polls showed that a price that leaves the vast majority of French people, nor is prepared to pay, as opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remind ourselves that the energy policies of our country has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410000-led jobs.
Because of their strong export character brings a host of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises on the international markets and creators of countless jobs.
France should take the decision to withdraw from nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs are victims, and the annual EUR 6 billion in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
What electricians would designed EPR work at 60 years if the decline is a recipe for his producers?
In order to solve the energy equation, we must acknowledge that there is not a work of the devil, a miracle cure for the production of electricity.
Developed by the company, Areva, low-carbon solutions to the use of nuclear power and renewable energy from the complementarity of energy sources.
To maintain the highest possible level of safety for nuclear power, an absolute imperative.
In France, we have a safety authority, uncompromising and transparent controls in existing plants, such as construction in Flamanville.
Working teams due to their professionalism have made a name, are just obsessed with security.
Within 50 years of nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only a single, and occurred at Three Mile Island is under normal operating conditions; it passed without consequences for humans and the environment.
Chernobyl was the drama created by reactor design and unendschuldbares, human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident of two unprecedented scale natural disasters caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw lessons from this accident, as it had done after the two previous.
As a result of this approach and cooperation of the security authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR is a draft, which would enable resilience to such phenomena.
Because it is considered among the electrical engineers than desirable to build a nuclear power plant to be turned, it would be a freeze in Flamanville a legendary gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein liesse leadership position in the inevitable nuclear power development.
It is inevitable and legitimate to seek the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to dominate emotions, dogmas and Parteimanöber debate, defined as economic, social and financial situation of our country.
