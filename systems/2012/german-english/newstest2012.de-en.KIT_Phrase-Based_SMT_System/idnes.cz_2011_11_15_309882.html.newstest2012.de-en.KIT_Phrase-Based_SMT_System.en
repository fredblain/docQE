V Need for steroids: "the run" - the illegal racing across America
Recession
The original reckless journey through a series of entirely preventable, amateurish mistakes routine to Frühschicht.
It was able to meet the ambitions of a large part of it, but what is the point, though it is obvious that no one had the inclination to do a bit more.
Even before he came to the Ladentische evoking the new part with the subtitle " the run ' high expectations.
He promised to postpone the bejahrte Games series ' need for speed, " a step in a new dimension and he seemed to be not only one of many action Rennspielen to be in the spielbaren demonstration examples.
We were also curious as to how the lateral passages, in which the main protagonist is rising from the car and on foot.
But how it is used in NFS, is much different than we had expected.
Sure, there are potentially quite decent Arkade races, but overall, the game will be reduced by some unnecessary mistakes in this series, more or less for a few years.
So there are no more mistakes, but rather signs of incomprehensible in principle laziness of the games developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First introduced in the history of its main character, Jack has some problems of a personal nature; it seems to be the only solution to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, to the steering wheel, with the task, to be the first in New York.
The basic idea involves a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into 10 stages and more than 50 individual race.
This means that each race will be fought on the other line, and that the various stages in different sufficiently different and interesting milieu.
No time has the impression that the game would be the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are still very nicely, although not the technical level of graphics on the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering news.
But the journey through the desert, obvious autumn landscape or high through deep snow landscape we visually very pleasant.
And atypical elements bring a bit of a change in the individual race.
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm, the strong point of view.
In the mountains, we must be careful, just as painful as that is not being buried by an avalanche.
Incidentally, are pretty well built in the individual race.
Only a few, but they are.
For a while, trying to overtake the mandatory number of opponents (in principle, a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the Stoppuhr), then expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And interfering nor the police, which wants to blow the whole thing.
A novelty passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more certain interactive animation, in which Jack anyone flees and where he must help the players, at the right moment the right button.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there is much less such passages in the game, as you would expect (only three).
This is ultimately a matter for the advantage, because at least has no chance of this element to be boring - it is in the context of the high point of the elements that make the game varied.
The Fahrmodell is progressing in the Fußtapfen the previous parts.
In other words, seen from today's spotlight, it snaps no trees, on the other hand, you could not say it would be a bad thing.
Anyone who seeks realistic simulations must look elsewhere.
But an action-laden cyclist at the European Fahrmodell will continue to do quite well, although we could compete better.
Until then, as far as everything.
Real problems only after a certain time.
The collision model is not OK in contrast to the Fahrmodell
It is a game of this kind is hard to expect that calculated complicated deformations and collisions, but in any impact on any object has a clue how the car is, obviously, not everything is in order.
A typical example: close overhaul or pre-travel in accommodating cars ' touched ' only slightly in others, almost identical situation but the slings and turns wild performance in some places the other car.
Or the Karre to scrap.
Thanks to the Restart system that makes nothing further, it is annoying.
The Restarts are resolved: if you have damage or remote route, then raises the game back to the last point of reference.
Only in each race has only five Restarts.
If they are exhausted, everything is go.
The Restarts are rather as a tool in the event that something does not succeed, but it should rely on no one.
Sometimes, however, does not help the Restart, there is nothing more than to learn the critical section from the head.
It is very embarrassed that the same things often happen at the same places.
Some curves, we must go to very specific way, for example, otherwise it is not easy.
Elsewhere, it is the appropriate place "civilian" cars in the same configuration, regardless of whether the first or fifth, five seconds sooner or later a minute.
This is particularly galling in situations when we see that the opponent before a romped in two forthcoming cars, but even there, the cars are already in such a position that they must avoid or delay.
And it does not matter when it arrives, everything is designed so that this situation is always close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, there are a few places where it is always on the same spot will be overtaken by the same opponents again without regard to the timing.
On Verrücktesten is at the end of the game in the long bridge, which is happening in the opposite direction.
The opponent is obviously to overtake.
And if he is already facing a, then that is the point of view, of course, so that they initially car a couple of times in Klump.
Clearly, we want to make the game simply more exciting and exciting but this intention is so clear that they quickly spoiled the joy of the game.
And that is a pity, because the game is quite entertaining despite easier Fahrmodell and also downloaded action so that almost no longer know where one of the head.
And in principle, regardless of what is to blame - the concept of fifty unique routes, the order of the race in a way that no volume of boredom, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is the change in the course of the race.
We must overlook the stations on the route, because you can change the car, although in most cases, the car is enough, it has.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the strong American limousines for straight highways and exotic super-sports car for the technical journeys, for example, on the Serpentinen in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the history of the game is also the tasks mode (challenges) - the race in the individual localities from history.
There is not just medals, but also to gain experience for their own profile, which is jointly for the tasks (challenges) and history.
In order to achieve higher driver level must be open to various objects: from the car to the baker's grounds for the profile.
It is also linked to the online function Autolog, among other things, its own results achieved with those of other comparing players and also provides for more collective functions.
An incomprehensible further blunders is a situation in the last race of the story.
Here is the car in a subway tunnel (nay), where in the dark on the rail rast (nay).
Look at the tachograph paragraphs between 150 (a) 200 km/h (far), but there is even an underground and drives an uncompromising to scrap.
In our editorial, we will still argue about whether it was a blackout of game makers, or whether the authors for dopey.
The technical side is nothing Überwältigendes but at least the visual overall impression is quite appealing, in most cases, and even brilliant.
Even more galling is that the Bildwiederholfrequenz is slowing in some exciting moments and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, particularly the accidents with greater numbers of participation, where a continuous FPS anyway.
The Tonwiedergabe is OK and the Sound Track is a matter of taste.
In a bid to raise such a broad as possible scale rather young audience, a Sound Track, a lá "every little" - but who is buying such a game because of the music?
The overall impression of Need for speed: the run? The feelings are more mixed.
If the game is not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes, we can say with great conviction that The run the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But the game is somehow unfinished.
A well done for pleasure, but we should be prepared that these errors with the power of airport lights in the eye.
