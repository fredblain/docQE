The CDU proposes that the EU president due to choose general vote
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party, without any real trouble.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but in the autumn, especially those activists are enough to make the government policy on the Greeks today and tomorrow, possibly Italy as too lax.
The presidential motion proposed by the Bureau of the European Commission was adopted almost unanimously.
Under 1001 delegates had only nine voted against ten had abstained from the vote.
The continuing several minutes Standing ovation from their first Interventionserlässen Angela Merkel, as well as a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, could be part of the three Euro-minded finance minister, no doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - as well as the subsequent application - slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less but more Europe."
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro."
The Chancellor is the time for a breakthrough in Europe. "
This could come through the control of the European Union, reinforcing modification of the Treaty of Lisbon on the budget policies of the countries in the euro zone; it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission, on the basis of general voting "in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is one of the amendment proposals adopted by Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schäuble godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 quickly agree on this revolution: Greater Britain is opposed to the cause, and the chief of the CDU to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same.
The milestone, however.
The delegates have rejected the weighting of any country in the ECB's Governing Board in accordance with the weighting of individual economies in an overwhelming majority of the proposal, which is clearly a comeback that Germany's position.
The sunset on calming the climate within their party Chancellor has strengthened the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it has not tried to win its congress at the expense of the ' small ' or in European countries, which would immediately give the arrogant Germany.
As far as the European request the relevance of the "Franco-German friendship" devotes a clause, Angela Merkel, France is not on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because it recalls that Leipzig two centuries ago, was at the centre of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the zuhöchst humiliating defeat of the Napoleonic army.
